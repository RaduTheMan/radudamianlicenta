1.You want to know what actors acted in movies in the decade starting with the year 1990. First write a query to retrieve all actors that
 acted in movies during the 1990s, where you return the released date, the movie title, and the collected actor names for the movie.
 For now do not worry about duplication.


Correct answer alternative:
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WITH collect(p.name) AS actors, m
WHERE 1990 <= m.released < 2000
RETURN actors, m.title AS movie, m.released AS released

Official answer:
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.released >= 1990 AND m.released < 2000
RETURN m.released, m.title, collect(a.name)


2.The results returned from the previous query include multiple rows for a movie released value. Next, modify the query so that the released 
date records returned are not duplicated. To implement this, you must add the collection of the movie titles to the results returned.

MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE 1990 <= m.released < 2000
RETURN collect(p.name) AS actors, collect(m.title) AS movies,  m.released AS released
