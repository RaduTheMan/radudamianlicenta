Similarity algorithms:

Similarity algorithms are used to find similar nodes in a network based on graph topology or their properties.
This approach is used in applications such as personalized recommendations and developing categorical hierarchies. 
The most common algorithms in this category are Jaccard Similarity and Cosine Similarity algorithms. They can
also be used to infer a monopartite projection of a bipartite graph.
