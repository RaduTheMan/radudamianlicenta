CSGO has hit rock bottom with Valve's missed promises of game changing updates and their lack of effort to combat the terrible cheating problem. Bugs have been in the game for years and still haven't been fixed. Cheating is out of control. Over the past few years of playing, cheating has gotten worse and worse to the point now where I end up playing against a cheater almost every game. Valve implemented the new ""trust"" matchmaking system to combat some of these issues but its lackluster algorithm still somehow thinks putting me, with years of gameplay and 3,000+ hours, against people playing on brand new accounts makes sense. I really don't know why I still put the effort to play this game anymore because it usually just ends up with me regretting it. I guess I just wish I could somehow have the fun I used to have playing this game but it seems those days are long gone.",Tue Mar 09 14:21:52 EET 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.",Thu Apr 01 04:37:24 EEST 2021,84d1b7cd-0282-4efd-bdde-3e3b54fe8a28

What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.

Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",Fri Dec 03 21:38:45 EET 2021,84d1b7cd-0282-4efd-bdde-3e3b54fe8a28

Тоглоомын эхэнд чи алан хядагчид эсвэл тусгайгийн цагдаа нар гэсэн хоёр багийн аль нэгэнд нь автоматаар хуваарилагдах болно. Хэрэв чамайг аз дайрвал, багт чинь 1 ширхэг орос тааралдана. Харин эсрэг тохиолдолд, 2-3 оростой нэг багт учирна гэж мэд! За тэгээд ... террористуудын гол даалгавар нь тун энгийн : тэсрэх бөмбөгөө замдаа гээлгүйхэн шиг авч явсаар 'Шороо Хоёр' гэдэг газарт модон texture-тай чулуун хайрцагнуудыг, харин 'Там' гэдэг газарт усан оргилуур доторх загаснуудыг дэлбэлж алах ёстой байгаа юм. Харин цагдаа нарын гол зорилго нь цаг дуусахаас өмнө очиж тэр бөмбөгийг нь салгаад хайрцагнуудыг, бас загаснуудыг аврахад оршино. Түүнчлэн, 'Албан Газар', 'Довтолгоо' зэрэг газруудад арай өөр дүрэм үйлчилдэг. Ердөө л шар өнгийн унтлагын хувцастай залуусыг чи А эсвэл B цэгүүдээс эсрэг багийнхандаа харагдалгүй нууцаар үүрч явсаар өөрсдийнхөө төрдөг дээрээ авчраад, шар зураасны ард гаргахад л гүйцээ! Тэгээд л чи ялах болно! Олзны хүмүүс ч аврагдах нь тэр! Браво! Бас чамд муу тоглох эрх байхгүй. Хэрвээ муу тоглоод эхлэх юм бол багийнхан чинь чамайг урагшгүй нөхөр, олхиогүй амьтан зэргээр чинь дуудах болно. Харин тэдэнтэй сөрж хэрэлдэх гэвэл төрсөн эхийгээ элдвээр дуудуулаад дуусна шүү! Тэгээд чамайг ичих ч үгүй багаасаа хөөхөөр санал хурааж эхлэхийг нь яана! Гэхдээ, арай соёлтой нэг нь чамайг айлын өргөмөл жаал, аль эсвэл торхноос олдсон бутач хүүхэд зэргээр нэрлэх байх л даа. Өө бас муу тоглох ёсгүй шигээ сайн тоглож бас болохгүй шүү. Хэрвээ чамайг сайн тоглоод эхэлбэл эсрэг багийнхан чинь чамайг хууран мэхлэгч, залилагчаар чинь дуудаж эхэлнэ. Бас тэдэнтэй хэрэлдэх гэвэл мөн л ээжийнхээ талаарх чихэнд чимэггүй нууцуудыг олж мэднэ.

Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps)CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter.Multiplayer:Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.Community:The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages. (malaka, cy ka bly at, kur wa, ich fick deine mutter, youre g ay, blo ody bas tard, kardashian) some examples.Graphics:Game looks ok for a 2004 source engine.

And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.Community:The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:1. Easter European Children,2. Normal People,3. Cheaters.CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.Gun Balance:Okay this one is good.Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!  Developer Support: After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies.",Wed Jan 05 13:13:34 EET 2022,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

I loved it. But this game has completely nose dived into hell. FILLED WITH HACKERS.... and now instead of you know fixing that stuff they decide to jump on a trend and make a BATTLE ROYAL MODE??????!! Literally this game was amazing and then they destroyed it by jumping on something that changed the game completely. Its free now there goes my money. This game was great until they chose to not be original and jump on every trend out there. Thats what killed this game.,Sat Jan 15 16:42:31 EET 2022,fc196f94-b366-4378-815a-62b874de0ec2

It annoys me that when I finally have the patiences to sit down and write a review about this game, that it had to be a negative one. I liked this game, loved it at some point, but it has evolved into a monsterious sh*t hole of a game. The updates are just getting rediculous. I have had, give or take, 1600 hours of competitive gameplay done and the ranking system is completely unreliable. I agree with most of the comments that say ""When you reach a certain rank, all you get are hackers."". I've read so many comments on how the community would like for VAC to be better and yet game developers are ignoring this call. Instead, they're making updates of which benefits them ""financially"". Like who in the world said that gloves would be a f*cking great asset to the game and that we needed more things to waste our money on. The game itself is cheap, yes, but the fact that the past updates has been about gaining money is beyond my comprehension. Please fix the game, thank you.Edit: I see now the game has gone Free To Play and implemented Battle Royale. What the hell is Valve thinking? The amount of hackers 10 updates ago were lots but still bareable (around 1 hacker per 15 matches) and now you've gone and opened the doors to them. I am glad I left the game before the previous free-to-play update was released. If any of you guys wanted this game and are happy about the FTP, trust me, you're going to regret getting this.",Thu Dec 09 10:48:50 EET 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also.

Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning.

They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.The real ranking system:Cheaters on topScammers in the middleLegit players at the bottomAt no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are.

CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.

Nobody asked for Battle Royale, and you can be assured that nobody asked for a free-to-play game. or prime status to all.I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore. I thought getting out of gold was hard before, how about when you can't be sure if that new account really is cheating or not?

Battle Royale does not fit in this game because CS:GO's combat system isn't really designed for it.

It's also the game that, at the time of writing this review, I have put the most hours into. It's so addicting, and if you find the right team to play with that communicates and strategizes, is an absolute blast and one of the best FPS games I have ever played.PositivesGreat graphics. The graphics on this game have aged well and look good. They're solid enough to not make you go blind.Built on the Source engine. I've always been a fan of the Source engine. It's very easy to run on any PC, has solid graphics, a deep options menu, which means the game is avaliable to tons of people.Great Gameplay. With smooth movement, unique spray patterns on all the guns, deep strategies gameplay wise and economically wise, ability to move silently, and more, CS:GO's gameplay is awesome. I like it a lot, and I find it very unique. The movement is smooth as well.Everyone is on an even playing field. The skills of a player only rely on their aim, reflexes, and expertise of the game, not XP like in CoD. For example, the other team can't automatically win just because they are all above level 50 and your team is a bunch of level 2s and 3s.Balanced maps. The maps of CS:GO are fine tuned, expertly crafted, and are all unique in their own ways. The defuse maps are constantly updated with tweaks to make them the best that they can be. Some maps receive complete makeovers, such as Train and Nuke, with Dust2 possibly recieving one very soon. The hostage and demolition maps are usually left in the dust as they're underplayed, but they're still solid maps.Operations. These are special events that Valve hold every couple months called Operations. For the price of $7, you can play two player co-op missions with a buddy and get case drops that you can turn around and sell for a dollar or two. Valve also release specially picked community-made maps that everyone can play for free.Community Servers. These servers host custom maps from the workshop. They also host custom gamemodes such as 1v1 and Surf.Skins. I find skins overall neat. While Valve can throw in some ugly and stupid skins, most of the skins are awesome, and are affordable. Some skins range from 3 pennies to thousands of dollars. The only skins I buy are ones that are under a dollar, with my rifle skins being a few dollars. There's likely no way in a million years I'm buying a thousand dollar skin.Gamemodes for both casual and hardcore gamers. While hardcore players will grind competitive defuse for hours a day, there's gamemodes for the casual player too, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, and a casual version of defuse that is easier than competitive defuse.Able to host your own server. While you can buy dedicated servers from various server hosters across the web, you can host your own server off your PC for free by downloading server files directly from Valve, and install custom plugins. I recently started to host my own server for me and a friend where I made it into a 1v1 server. While it's tough to set up, which happens with every server, it's awesome that you can do it for free.MixedToxic community. While there's teammates that are supportive and will communicate and strategize with you, there's also teammates that will insult and harass you if you aren't playing well. They will scream ""He's over there, dumba**! A MAIN!"" in your ear while you're trying to focus on the game. It's insanely annoying, and always gets you killed. Because you died, he'll start a vote to kick you. Screw those toxic POSs. There's teammates that have no idea what they're doing and will run and gun like it's CoD, along with having awful crosshair placement, so they'll be looking at walls when they die. There's teammates that will yell into their mic and act like they're funny. It's a community that's a dense minefield of good and bad, and one bad player can completely ruin your experience.Glove Skins. While I think skins are awesome, I think they're good enough on the guns. Valve have made glove skins, which I rarely see people use. It's just silly to make glove skins while people have been asking for 128 tick servers and a stricter anti-cheat for ages.NegativesVAC isn't the best. While Valve has been fighting cheaters with VAC and the recent creation of the Overwatch system, where specially picked CSGO players can review footage of reported players and judge if they're cheating, hackers are still thriving in CSGO. It's an infamous issue that has plagued the game for ages. While they aren't in every single match you play, they still exist, especially in the higher ranks of competitive.Gambing and Match Betting. Skins have caused negative things to happen that Valve weren't anticipating. People will gamble skins on coin flips and such, which leads into the skin gambling contraversy that exploded not too long ago, and people will bet on matches with skins. It's just sketchy stuff, and has generated some toxicitiy in the CSGO community.64 tick servers. I think 128 tick servers are needed, especially for a game as competitive as CSGO. With all the money Valve has made from CSGO, it's likely that they can update their servers to 128 tick so gameplay is smoother and server-side issues aren't as much of a problem.SummaryDespite all the toxicity associated with the game, CSGO is still a great game in my eyes. It's a unique FPS that I will happily play for many more hours to come so I can hone my skills and become a dominant player.I decided to archive my old review.

Hacking is pointless and stupid and makes the game not fun for others. Just play the actual game. Besides hackers, there are people in competitive games who make you want to rage quit or shoot them by blocking your way to not let you out of spawn on PURPOSE, therefore getting a 30 minute-7 day ban. And then there are the ones who kick people for being a different race or being a weeb for no other reason. It's horrible. I can't belive there are people who would do such a thing like that. I can't believe this is what we've become. There are other things that i have problems with, like competitve skill groups, and the fact that i have met people who i became friends with, but were actually just pretending the entire time, or all of a suddon hate me for who i am.

I love Valve. I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it.",Fri Apr 24 02:25:36 EEST 2020,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.-GamemodesCasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily.Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):MeAmerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensAngry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseAnother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuesSomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vieOther team:Uber SmurfSomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiesSomeone in a partySomeone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a roundAnime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and ScoutUh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui-Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: AKs-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and ArmorCounter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy-Round Two: Some SMG-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and ArmorEco Round? Doesn't exist in low Silver xDSave? Doesn't really happenStrategy? ""B"", ""Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it.You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill.-Rank up SystemCS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.-SmurfingA ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.-VAC System/OverwatchYeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.-CommunityI've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstopUnmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!""Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/Cuties and Hotties (right here)Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the gamePeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of themGrill GamersPeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GOThere are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.-CS:GO Skins and CasesI've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.-Valve/Game DevelopersEh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.-Friendly Aspect to the game?Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.-Overall OpinionIt's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come.

Well, to begin with Counter Strike is a very unique FPS game.  i first played this game in spring 2013 on and off. i finally think i have enough experience to write a review. Unlike other fake games we shall not name (CoD, BF) this game requires some knowledge and skill to play. Pros:Counter Strike does not require a super beefy computer and can be played with a average set up and hardwareCounter Strike has a ""decent"" community and most players are friendly to the other players (i said ""decent"")Counter Strike is not a pay to win game, you are not required to pay money and keep playing, the Operation passes are to support the devs and help keep the game going.Counter Strike has a growing community and you should be able to find competitve matches quickly (depending on the maps you select)Counter Strike has Dust II, Dust II is the best map every created for Competitive level of gameplay.Counter Strike is not FTP, if Counter Strike was FTP the community would crumbleCons:Counter Strike has had problems with Smurfs in the past, the problem has been fixed a little bit, but there are still some smurf problems. Smurfs can ruin a entire game and i know some players who quit playing because of the SmurfsCounter Strike has some hacker and cheater problems, i have played many games where i have run into a cheater. Cheaters ruin the game and it is no fun to play with cheaters.(There are some players who will play without a mic, grief, or throw games, this mostly occurs at lower levels, however i have not run into many of these players)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are my thoughts on the game Counter Strike: Global OffensiveI would really suggest giving this game a try if you have not tried it before Thank you for taking your time and reading my review- Boingdom",Tue Jan 04 01:05:37 EET 2022,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:Sorry about the rant but this update has been rather disappointing xD",Tue Dec 07 14:13:46 EET 2021,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.Valve's GreedYour intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this?The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.EpilogueI can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve.

Even if they claim to have ""fixed"" the whole HitBox system, is still s**t! I still was shooting people, seeing blood coming out, even heard the Headshot sound, but no reg. Funny thing right? Happens... (it should not)2) One of the Worst anti-Cheat system (VAC) that even a 14 years old kid, with a really small knowledge of programming can get through that by-pass. Funny thing when they released this whole ""Overwatch"" thing, when you are LEM with 2k+ hours, and there's a Gold Nova 2 with 350+ hours to judge your gameplay if you're hacking or not!3) Really bad gaming community including 12 y.o. kids from Different countries , having 0 knowledge of English. Same happened with older players. Toxic players are no. 2 problem, but I gotta admit, people are Not as toxic as the League of Legends' ones... 4) Really bad servers, with the whole valve giving 0 f***s about it. (64 ticks while Every damn other Community server has 128)5) Absolutely bad Game Support (you can't even e-mail them, you have to search deep to find an address to contact them)6) SMURFS.

Cheaper guns are way better than Expensive ones! 2.700$ 1-shot kill and 3.100$ 2-shot kill in the Head! Not to mention 500$ Tec-9 at close range! As much as the Prices are so close to Realism, gameplay is NOT! I can say that I used to have fun games 2 years ago, made a lot of friends from this game, bad as the time goes by, this game is dying and Valve is responsible for this! If a whole game company doesn't care for a game they made, that is the Most populated they ever made, then there's no reason to keep playing it!  If you're a new player , or even if you're thinking of getting this game, DON'T DO IT! Get some more money, and spend them on other games, or even Free2Play games that are actually WAY better than this... Or even just buy yourself a good MacDonalds meal.

First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka:Screenshot of the comment: http://imgur.com/a/i80j3Comment: 'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'My Response: 1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).  6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game.

I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more.However, I have to play this game:1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance, 2. There's something addicting about being british and joining a game and speaking with an accent,3. On the occasional games that teams are balanced and there's no cheaters, they have been known to be fun (I swear),4.

IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure.

The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done.

Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.",Sat Aug 21 00:25:09 EEST 2021,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted.

You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it.

(votekicking)Ofcourse there are alternatives matchmaking clients but new people do a little bit know that their skill won't fit for that.I recommend you to queue with 4 friends and that you play regularly with them, that is the best way to learn and not be screwed over by a team griefer.So do I recommend the game itself?Yes, I love how you have to use both of your brain and skill to win the game.Do I recommend the game to new people reading this?If you want to buy it, then buy it, thats up to you since it's your money.The reason I won't recommend it is that it will be very hard to learn and enjoy the game. Ofcourse not everyone is a scumbag, it's just that the game won't be fun as you tought it was by these people and I don't want you to waste your time and money.",Sun Nov 21 11:07:51 EET 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

So when I started doing it, at the half of it, I ran out of place. Couldn't type anymore.So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad. FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :DBut don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) ",Sat Dec 25 21:35:15 EET 2021,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

Again, maybe that's the point, maybe it's to inspire you to meditate on what just happened, but I just found it boring as there was never enough story development to necessitate that, and muted my emotional investment by the time I actually got to where I was supposed to be. It's also rather expensive given how short it is, which also makes it difficult to recommend to anyone. I can understand the appeal for some, but only some, not very many.\n\n5.5/10.""",Mon Mar 09 02:23:38 EET 2020,fb2534e4-3a2a-486f-8f86-2c6b869a3bcf

I was only able to play on iMac the past one and half year. February 2016, I finally built up my first gaming PC. On March 2st 2016, I got invited to IEM ESL KATOWICE 2016 (Also called ICK 2016, the CS:GO female tournament) with Team Elysium Female. BEST TRIP IN MY LIFE. 14年第一次看的比赛是科隆，15年初我在斗鱼转播高清的卡托比赛。那时候主播很少，妹子也没有。虽然看不太懂，但是就是觉得很好看。半夜四点起来就转播比赛，然后用着小银条的技术""解说“比赛。观看的人很多，弹幕也被刷的满满的，想想就超级激动。还记得是Fnatic拿了冠军，那天yicofan也在qq里和直播间里一直跟我看。已经不再怎么玩游戏的我，一辈子都没有想到整整一年后，居然是和妹子还有yicofan站在卡托的决赛舞台前观看比赛。。。那个画面，真的一辈子都忘不了。。。也谢谢你们给我的这个机会因为CSGO相识后面基的好友：榛子Hazel，曾哥Yicofan，大眼睛，维维Timing，乔阿姨大哥SAGA，大橙子，小鱼儿tingtian :2017stickypopsicle:坐等面基喜+1",Mon Nov 22 04:20:04 EET 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend.",Sat Oct 23 02:44:31 EEST 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.Tryhards. Goes without any words :>Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is.

If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead. Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist.

(Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!Neutrals:(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.",Wed Jun 24 15:58:19 EEST 2020,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections.

My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games.Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun.BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"".After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others.You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review.I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?!I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do.To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers.This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve!And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"".So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system.This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture.You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins.This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame.By the way:Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system.Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days....",Wed Jan 05 18:36:38 EET 2022,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: Pistols desperately need balance. Netcode and servers are horrible.VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience.",Sun Dec 06 06:00:18 EET 2020,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

The competitive aspect used to seem like a good thing, but people take this game way too seriously and will lash out at you if you do anything even slightly wrong, and then on the other hand there are people who don't take it seriously enough and join competitive games just to annoy the people who take it seriously. There is no balance to this, you will hardly ever find a good team that you enjoy playing with.Maps - There may seem like a decent selection of maps to choose from, but there are only a select few which actually get played, and those are the old maps which most people have played thousands of times so it may be hard to get into, you may even feel discouraged.Not P2W - This game isn't pay to win, there are only weapon/glove skins which are purely cosmetic or different knives which ultimately all do the same thing, there has been a lot of controversy in the past about this kind of system being available to kids, there are cases where children steal their parents credit card just to buy skins.Many of the recent updates over the past year or so have been garbage, with many maps being added which almost never get played after a week, along with glove skins and other items so that valve can make money. I feel like this game has been abandoned by the developers, and now they primarily use it as another way to make easy money, completely disregarding the loyal playerbase and professional players.Smurfs (an experienced player using a new account to face lower ranks) and hackers are a pretty big problem in this game, and despite valves many failed attempts at combating the issue almost nothing has changed. Valves anti-cheat is garbage, and if you do end up getting this game, I would reccomend either faceit or ESEA, because their anti-cheat is a lot better and you generally face better players than if you were to play regular competitive.Although this game used to be a lot of fun to play competitively with friends, I can not reccomend it in it's current state, in my eyes this game is dying and after putting just over 1000 hours into it, I am ready to never play it again.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)",Mon Nov 29 11:50:33 EET 2021,36632203-f738-4537-9a19-0a723bfe371a

There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved.

I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts.

Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry.

Not to mention that after the game is over, you're glad because you get the part ways and play another game with other players that won't give you a hard time. Oh wait, no you don't.

I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates.

I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.",Sun Mar 28 01:24:42 EET 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

Good job Valve!Game physics 8/10Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)Community 6/10Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant.

Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.

All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank.

You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform. Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player.Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything.You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings.At it's core CS:GO is a solid competitive team FPS with a lot of gameplay depth, good map pool, active playerbase and lots to learn and room to improve yourself. There's just many little pitfalls. I think a lot of people will end up spending more time on this game than they initially expected. I don't know if I'd recommend it. You get really into it and then it just becomes too frustrating.",Thu Oct 28 23:33:48 EEST 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so goddamn much to you.And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community.",Tue Jul 14 07:00:08 EEST 2020,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.VALVE ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM (VAC) Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets. SMURFSMaybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man.

Here's whyPlayers: The community is getting worse and worse, as more and more Smurfers and Cheaters are coming in and Valve is doing nothing against that.Mechanics: For a game as big as CS:GO it's just sad. Many hits don't register, and that's because 64Tick-Servers and bad Hitboxes, but again, Valve does nothing.Anti-Cheat: VAC (Valve-Allows-Cheaters) is like nonexistent. Cheaters can Spinbot and OBVIOUSLY cheat, because VAC just doesn't work. If you want a working AntiCheat go play ESEA or Face.it, their AntiCheat does work.All in all, things need to change for this game to be fun for many people again, sadly, it still generates infinite money and probably won't die the next years...

People are always yelling or playing music in the mic, throwing around insults, complaining about everything (you're doing too good, you're doing too bad, they don't like the weapon you're using, etc) and voting to kick people for no reason. I muted my mic, but then they get mad, because you cant hear them and yeah.Can't say I'm a fan of bullets not going toward your crosshair either, because of the recoil ""bullet patterns"". It's a problem since they're not random, so you're forced to learn them if you want to compete, because everyone else knows them. So in those situations where you want to hold down the fire button for longer than 1 second during close range combat and go for a headshot, you have to aim at their feet, then a little to the left, then the right. It's incredibly frustrating. Most of the time, you'll get beat by someone who took the time to download the recoil bullet pattern training map and mastered it.So if you have nothing, but free time to play this game everyday, feel like ""training"" and can deal with the overwhelming bad community, then this might be for you.

The 'hat system' is a clear indication that it is time to move on, some 15 years after the creation of the original, and break free of the stale CS formula. Bring something new and engaging to the table... please leave your hats at home.(This game was decent when first it came out and a year or so after - it was a blast teaming up with randoms and making friends to play competitive. The competitive mode really brought the best out of the what the game had to offer.)On the upside, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege may be the answer to the new competitive FPS standard, the breath of fresh air that people have been waiting for.*Please feel free to thumb down this review, if CS:GO is the only game you've ever played*",Thu Sep 16 15:19:08 EEST 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever.

Just look up a few Youtube videos that recorded some arguments on CSGO):1) Mr. L33t, the egotistical, temperamental♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who blames everything on you or other teammates-People like Mr. L33t think they're good. They're ones who feel entitled to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because they think their skill will win the game anyway. Imagine the following scenario, okay? Here it goes: you're playing a match defending a bombsite on the Terrorist side. Mr. L33t is carefully watching the bombsite's right flank as a sniper. An enemy player suddenly appears, who also has a sniper rifle. Mr. L33t and the enemy player try to one shot each other. Since you don't want to peak the sniper and get killed insantly, you hang back at the bomb site and play it smart like your other teammates. Mr. L33t, on the other hand, wants to get that kill so bad that he ends up getting sloppy. Then Mr. L33t dies. Soon enough, you end up being the last living member of your team, and you're still hiding. Meanwhile, the enemy team also has only one member after all the fighting.Now, you know this guy has a sniper rifle, so you ain't going to peak. Of course, there's a problem. He can approach you from multiple sides. You have two choices to approach this situation:A: You can take a risk and look for him, and if you're lucky enough, kill him. However, the downside to this decision is that if you end up dying, Mr. L33t will say ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE CAMPED!B: You can continue hiding in the same spot and hope to ambush them. However, if the enemy player has a good guess that you're hiding in that spot, he will prefire the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and kill you. If you die, Mr. L33t will say something along the lines of ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE PEAKED AND LOOKED FOR HIM!"" Or he will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you for not prefiring, even though if you did, you would never have hit the enemy player and instead give away your exact position, so even though the enemy player had a guess of where you're hiding, now he knows for sure. So which choice is the right choice? None, because you never had a chance to kill him in the first place and would die regardless. Meanwhile, Mr. L33t will be busy telling the whole team to join his circle jerk of hate, because clearly you are a bad player for not being able to kill him.You could, of course, tell Mr. L33t that if he were such a good player, he would have killed him long before it even became a problem, but it's clearly not his fault because he's the most important snowflake on this team. And remember the last round he tried to clutch as the last player? Yeah, he didn't clutch that match either, and he did far worse than you at it, but he decided to ♥♥♥♥♥ at his teammates anyway for not giving him proper call outs, even though that's exactly what you did. What did this guy do? He didn't give you ANY call outs. You know what's worse than playing on a team with Mr. L33t? Playing a game with 2 or more Mr. L33ts. Let the vote kick commence, but it's not like having them kick you off the team will make any difference because they're going to lose the competitve game anyway.2) Mic Spamming Mikey, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound loops, songs, memes, and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS in a comp match who wonders why the team can't hear any callouts.You would think Mic Spamming Mikey is a troll, but unlike other mic spammers, Mikey is taking this game half-seriously, so he's putting in some effort to win, although it's not much, mind you...Basically Mikey thinks everyone enjoys the BS he ♥♥♥♥♥ out of his mic, because listening to his stupid songs that have lyrics like ""touch muh wang wang"" and ""I'm so fresh you can suck muh nuts"" are clearly more important than listening to callouts. Nobody's going to be able to hear call outs with loud volume like that. Then comes the moment where a teammate dies, then Mikey says ""OMFG HOW COULD YOU NOT HEAR THE CALLOUTS? VOTEKICK!"" It's even worse if Mikey turns out to have the same personality traits that Mr. L33t has.3) Jackass Jimmy, the idiot with no sense of awareness.Jackass Jimmy isn't a noob. He's been playing this for a while. However, he still plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so he has absolutely no excuse to be an idiot. Jackass Jimmy still doesn't know call outs, recoil patterns, the difference between camping and rushing, and a whole lot of other obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥that you need to know. Jackass Jimmy is the type of person to hear someone say ""They're rushing B! They 're rushing B!"" and still stay at bombsite A because he doesn't know how to read a map. He's the type of person to fire a gun full auto at point blank range and still not kill his intended target. He's the type of person to buy an auto sniper, only to miss every shot with it and give the enemy team a generous donation of an OP weapon after getting killed.Jackass Jimmy isn't even trying at this point.4) Trolling Tommy and Backup BillyTrolling Tommy likes to troll competitive games just to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. He'll do anything to get on your nerves, whether it's purposely playing like♥♥♥♥♥♥ getting in your face to keep you from using your gun, flashing your teammates, ""accidentally"" teamkilling you, spinning around in spawn, and a whole list of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Naturally, such behavior warrants a quick and hasty votekick, but not for Trolling Tommy. You see, Trolling Tommy always comes with another equally stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥called Backup Billy. Backup Billy also likes to troll the game, but he prefers to blend in with the crowd and act like he's not part of it. Backup Billy's job is to keep Tommy from getting votekicked, so he'll always vote no. He'll lie and tell you he voted yes, then blame it on someone else.5) Hacking Harley, the hacking piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from the enemy team who keeps you from winning.In most circumstances, hacker accusations are unfounded and usually are wrong. However, in cases where there clearly is a hacker in your competitive mach, Hacking Harley just loves to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with their aimbot, wall hacks, spinbot, whatever. Forget having their team votekick them. Those guys want a quick and easy win. Enjoy losing a competitive match that could have easily been won by you if everyone played fair and square.6) Mr. SaltyMr. Salty has a temper like Mr. L33t, but Mr. Salty doesn't brag about how good he is. Instead, he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over trivial things. He will team kill his teammates for accidentally shooting him, making the whole team lose the match. He'll get angry at you for trying to give him advice. Mr. Salty is the type of person who has been on a losing streak in the past couple of matches so anything will♥♥♥♥♥♥him off. P.S.Casual matches would also be more enjoyable if we didn't have the following idiots:1) Mic Spamming Mikey (he's a full blown troll here)2) Tryhard Johnson - this guy is just like Mr. L33t, except he's even ♥♥♥♥♥ier and treats casual like a competitive game. He won't give new players the chance to learn and will vote kick them on the spot if they make a mistake they can afford to make.

I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game. Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community.UPDATE 05/10/2016:The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same. Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it.UPDATE 09/30/2016:I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people.UPDATE 11/12/2016:Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all. I'm going to ask for my money back because this is one of the worst community's to play with along with poor updates and consistently making non-broken maps more broken/""balanced"". I have been playing on and off for years now and it looks like I may stay off this game for forever because of this toxic, unsupportive cretins and terrible company/dev updates that (again) don't help with stupid updates that don't improve the game, just their wallets.UPDATE 03/07/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY):Yet again just wanted to kill time, go on for a few casual matches and (as a terrorist) CT's have nothing but awps, autos and negevs for 4 matches in a row!!!

Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games.

Never got notified that they got banned as i got once when i had 50 hours. Now I lose every round because i have to carry or enemy is damn good, I dont get good teamates as I would love to, they are too bad for me or 2 strong so i cant get any kills. I hate when i join game and in first half 2 of my teamates leave game. Anything isnt better with Trust mode that was added... I dont get wtf new dust 2 map is, it looks like you just used some parts of Office ( T spawn? ), Inferno ( B site), and Italy + Canals. Tunnels look almost same as tunnels in Aztec, I have to say that my fps isnt that bad for me like for other players it is, I usually have about 45-60fps in dust 2 40-50fps ( And that isnt very bad because I learned how to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop. ) Other thing I have to say for Nuke that has 25-35fps which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and what the hell is minimap and bomb sound on Nuke. I am at B site in doors room ( idk its name but its nice to hide ), and I hear bomb like it is 2 meters from me. I told my teamate that bomb is on B and after about 20 seconds we realized that it is on A... but it was too late gg wp.♥♥♥♥♥♥mapAztec got removed from game and there is achievment that says "" Win 100 rounds on Aztec "". What fu*king idiot removed Aztec and Vertigo from game. Maps werent balanced, true, but that isnt reason to remove them from game. And I dont get it why you dont bring them back with message "" We added removed maps to game because community wanted it. "" And why would you like to remove maps from competitive and make players unhappy? So people have more time to buy skins? Or write long reviews like I am doing now? You are just ruining the game with new updates. And about skins, almost all csgo profit comes from skins because some rich Americans have to buy Dragon Lore ( no hate ). Just imagine war with painted guns, unrealistic. You made skin market with in game inspect from nice tactical FPS game. And knife in game costs 5 more times then real life knife, you are just making people an idiots.Today I playied vs spinboter on Cache, and best thing is that hacker had 1400 gours in game. Idk, maybe he got hack when he had 1200 or 1300 hours, but after 200 hours in game (I just guess) this guy is still playing and ruining other people's fun. After all stupid things and toxic enemies who say ""ez ez ez"" when they win competitive match, especially if they have less kills then worst guy in my team. Also I got kicked for being the best one in game with 32 kills and ofc I got derank... All at all, I hate it because it isnt good balanced. And BOTs arent listening, I dont care about your stupid new shootgun update, like anybody will use shootguns they are sh#t in csgo and cost too much, so could you make BOTs listen and not die in first 20 seconds of the match...but no, shootguns are the most important thing ...I playied Wingman cuz I was bored and I dont get its new ranking system, something changed... Firstly I won 2 games in a row and after that lost and BOOM! I deranked to gn4 from mg1. After that I lost one more time and deranked to gn3, wow!!! After that thingie I won 3 matches and got no rankup and after that lost 1 match and deranked to gn2... WHAT THE F#Ck ?!?!?!?!?!?! I guess this is one more of VALVE'S briliant updates where you cant rankup up in Wingman and can derank if you lose only one match, Im not joking. This is for real and I dont know what is going on, I got matched against silvers as mg1 and that is reason for sure... but those guys play better then some of my friends that are mg2 or mg elite in Wingman... I swear.... They have less then 100 hours and play awesome. Well that is why I deranked wow... I wasnt playing csgo about 1 month, cuz its absolute bulls#it in my opinion. And that is the reason why game gave me to play vs silvers, I guess... and now I have Gold Nova 2 instead of MG1 with win/lose=10 ^_^Also when griefers are in my team they kill me and other teamate and just leave with 30 minutes ban, they got 30 minutes ban and we lost our ranks. That is fu*king nice Valve, fu*king nice. And after griefers leave in 3rd round, later result is 14 - 4 (for enemy)  I abandoned the match and got 24 hour ban. Well yes... Again fu#king nice Valve.One more time I got trolls in team, I found a nice chance to kick 2 of them because other 2 got kicked after they killed me on the start of first 2 rounds. After I kicked 2 of them It was 5v1 and I surrendered. When I came to lobby it said I'm banned for 7 days ""you kicked to many players""?!?!?!?... fu#k you and your stupid game!!!PS: I'm silver elite now and I was silver elite master after 20 hours in game. Logic. I have the most kills every match but I lose because my teamates are disabled idiots. Well...

This game needs a heavy balance check until they implemented mmr and needs to stop NERFING killers. The Killer is meant to have pressure as it is a 1v4 element the killer is already at a disadvantage from the start anymore nerfs to them makes it far more worse then it already is.

THe developers of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game do not give two butt♥♥♥♥s about the players, they care only about money. Instead of making this game better and fixing bugs, they add cases and sprays. At times, I question why I I still play this god awful excuse of a game. The one great thing about this community was the ability to gamble your skins, and ecspecially csgolounge. Not only did valve attempt to fully cease operations on gambling sites, they also took down csgolounge, the biggest and most reliable betting site of them all (also a personal favorite of mine). On top of these horrific displays of costumer servive by valve, they also have a ranking system that is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow that i could litterally rank up faster in the actual U.S. military. And dont even get me started about the god damn morons you find in matchmaking. I often find that 99 out of 100 of my teammates that i am randomly get queud with are absoulutely brain dead, and have little to no knowledge about the game and how it functions. Now on to a very important issue that is troubling our community, the grill (girl) population is extremely scarce, you could imagine my frustration as a man trying to get in some dank phone sex after a compettitive match. Not only this, but it seems as though the grills that are playing csgo, 1. pay no attention to my extremely rushed and desperate advances toward them. 2. grills also seem to be treated like gods in this game, (even though they are all really ♥♥♥♥ing bad) and almost always have extremely expensive inventories. And on to my final issue with this game, the man who runs the show.... yup, thats right, im talking about you Gaby boy. Gaben, also known as gay piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥fan boy obese nerd online legend real life loser-having♥♥♥♥♥Gaben has slowly destroyed this game, due to the constant uploads of new cases and operations, just so that fat bastard can get some more cash from twelve year olds around the world.

Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10.",Sun Sep 13 02:44:01 EEST 2020,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first. ",Wed Jul 21 18:28:27 EEST 2021,84d1b7cd-0282-4efd-bdde-3e3b54fe8a28

Additionally, the crawl to level 21 (i.e. a requirement to play prime account matchmaking, which slightly decreases cheating encounters) is grueling given that the number of cheaters in non-prime results in slowed leveling; competitive matchmaking consistently provides the highest XP reward, which is dependent on rounds won. Valve relies on a peer review system (i.e. Overwatch) to punish potential cheaters, which serves as a do-it-yourself solution that is supplemented with VAC (i.e. an ineffective anti-cheating solution). Cheaters are not deterred as an overwatch conviction commonly results in the individual obtaining an alternate account. Despite Valve’s profit margins being nourished by superfluous additions (stickers, temporary graffiti, skins, music kits, etc.) the game has been lacking substantial content in the form of Operations, which are accompanied by new maps. The previous operation occurred almost a year ago, which far exceeds the average time between the last six operations of five weeks. Also, the gaming community is vitriolic - there are countless incidents of bigotry, griefing, etc. – it's a Sisyphean struggle of always wanting to expect the best out of CS:GO before being unfailingly reminded of its shortcomings. After nearly 1000 hours, I was left exhausted and resigned myself to the rampant cheating - I piecemealed together my own cheat using articles from numerous public forums. Expectedly, this resulted in me being overwatch banned after countering a series of cheaters in competitive prime-matched games. This 'other side' does not provide any reprieve - even the slightest tinge of a perceived good play, whether assisted with cheats or not, provokes the veiled hackers. I give up on this game as Valve has long before me.tl;dr                                                         …………………./´¯/)                                                        ………………..,/¯../                                                        ………………./…./                                                        ………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸                                                        ………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\                                                        ……..(‘(…´…´…. ¯~/’…’)                                                        ………\……………..’…../                                                        ……….”…\………. _.·´                                                        …………\…………..(                                                        …………..\………….\… CS:GO Excessive number of cheaters primarily in matchmaking (i.e. indistinct or outright) Lack of substantial content (e.g. 1+ year to release an Operation); however, Valve will occasionally release minor fixes for the existing map pool whether aesthetic or technical Ineffective anti-cheating engine and DIY stopgap (i.e. Overwatch) Vitriolic community and ineffective counter-measures Placebo buttons (i.e. report text / voice abuse)   Low incidence of griefing convictions   Heroes of the Storm adopted an effective abuse system a few months after release – Introducing New Reporting Options and the Silence Penalty[us.battle.net] - why is CS:GO lagging behind?We view any system that generates revenue at the cost of consumer happiness as a broken system that we need to fix - Kyle Davis (Valve) - In-Game Economies in Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 Steam Dev Days 2014 A common occurrence in CS:GO [image.prntscr.com] ",Thu Nov 25 06:47:38 EET 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

Cheating:There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!2. DDOS-ing:I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!3. Smurfing:Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!4. Patches:Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!6. Community:The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.Over all:Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!",Mon Dec 27 15:10:39 EET 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else.

Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive",Sat Jan 08 06:28:08 EET 2022,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team.

Stop. Don't bother. Save yourself the heart condition and stick to casual. Or don't play at all, that would be the optimal choice. This game is a test of character, not just a test of skill, and I will tell you why.This game splits everyone into one of 3 categories of player, the one who is bad at playing but can learn and improve, the expert player who harrasses and belittles all others for not being good enough, and the trash players who votekicks and teamkills reguardless of target or skill. This, of course, is nothing new and is pretty common in all online multiplayer games. The harshness of this game, however startlingly eclipses all other communities I have ever seen, creating a sinkhole of reason and leaving everyone with pure hatred not only for the opposite team, but every single person on their own team.You see, like the snake that consumes it's tail, all players that stick with this game end up reaching the second archetype, who in turn become the harrassers after all the hostility they put up with. They go and become the average player in the game, maybe a youtuber, who baits others into trying the game and constantly filling the quota of targets to harrass and belittle. It's a self sustained cycle that has slowly ramped up since the game first came out in 2012, which I can attest as I have been here since the beginning (my hour count doesn't reflect this, so it doesn't relate).That's not to say this is a bad game, no no no. It's just that the entirety of the community is toxic and spiteful, with about 3/4 of them (a generous measurement I'm sure) that WILL sour the game for you. On the other hand if you somehow fit into this description, then by all means try your luck. I promise you your newly found anger management disorder will find a perfect home in your life.If you've made it this far you're either intrigued by what I've said thus far, or you are skipping to the end to see my point. Well either way here it is:If you really want to play this, whether it's for a friend or personal interest, stick to the casual and more open game modes, otherwise I guarantee that you will not like the outcome. Even if you do decide you like it, you will reach a point where you reassess what you've experienced, the community you've exp[osed yourself to, and eventually decide whether you want to put up with this anymore.

Here's what I have to say about GO...CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.",Sun Dec 05 12:07:10 EET 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.

However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any enjoyment out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't touchy teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are vastly outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be impossible to do so if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire (which you will see a lot of), I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature almost every time. I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time and the veteran players aren't going to stick around forever, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.Another issue is that in the update cycle for this game, things often end up even more broken than repaired. As of right now there are some serious problems with frame rate drops and hit detection, which you probably imagine would take the highest priority on the developer to-do-list, but no. Skins, cases and all other forms of micro-transactions always take the highest priority. I appreciate that Valve is a business and that their goal is to make money, but nobody is going to stick around to play a broken game when they eventually get fed up of it like I and so many others have. We paid for this game and it is your duty to maintain it and make sure everything works like it's supposed to! On one final personal note, I really wish that there was some kind of option to disable skins in-game and maintain only the default models. They're bloody ugly and ruin the immersion, but this is only a personal gripe.The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community and poor maintenance.Update: As of January 2017, I decided to try playing this game again to see if things have gotten any better. I'm afraid not, it's still in poor condition, hit detection is even worse and the community is still as toxic as ever. But hey, at least the cash-cow is still flowing in the forms of ""Glove Cases"" now, right? Sigh...",Sun Aug 01 17:08:20 EEST 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open. So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game. Which is disturbing when you connect to the game and you hear a 9 year old talk about his up's and down's with gambling his skins away....I would not recommend buying this game unless you intend on being a troll and can stand not getting agrravated by other trolls on this game.",Sun Mar 21 18:40:39 EET 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

My first encounter with the series was in 2002 in the cyber coffees, maybe i was 4-5 years old at the time and we used to play CS 1.5 and Half-Life DM, fun times :). From 2002 to this date, i've been a loyal player of the Counter-Strike series. There is no other game that made me that much addicted for such a long time, believe me. Back in the day it was Counter-Strike 1.6, now it's CS:GO.Once i get into CS:GO, i can't quit. It's an extremely addictive game once you get into the competitive matchmaking and that's the worst thing, because i can't quit. I've been uninstalling it every week not because of rage-quits, but to prevent my self of playing it, then 4-5 days later i install it again. I love CS:GO, yet i hate it at the same time, because of my addiction problem with it. It's not CS:GO's fault that i am addicted to it, but this game is like the ciggarets - once you start smoking, you can barely quit them, and same goes for CS:GO, especially in the Competitive mode.",Sun Apr 18 09:14:26 EEST 2021,84d1b7cd-0282-4efd-bdde-3e3b54fe8a28

As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad. Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into? People getting CRAZY about chargeable SKINS that only aesthetically make a difference? You tell me.Anyways, enough of that crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ opinions are opinions, right?Controls are okay, graphics don't matter anyways, teamplay is strong, skill is required, what else to say? I think there are enough reviews about the actual game mechanics other than the critizised points listed above, so let me be your hero and skip that part. I haven't written reviews in a while, so let's end this one as it would fit into the CSGO Community.C yka ♥♥♥♥♥, I'll smoke mid, gg wp.",Tue May 11 06:57:49 EEST 2021,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

I soon left CS GO to go back to other games I was playing at the time such as Dota 2 (another Valve game that has tons of hats) and H1Z1 (a game that has tons of hats because it wants to be like Valve).I recently came back to CS GO and have found a much deeper appreciation for it. While I did promise myself when I first got it that I wouldn't go crazy with buying skins, I recently did binge on getting a skin for every weapon. Most skins however were very cheap and I didn't dare attempt to go after a knife since I suck with sneaking up on people anyway.Now unto the actual review. Through practicing in Team Death Match, I've been learning how to use the weapons a lot more efficiently. I'm still nowhere near good but I do actually understand that tapping rather than spraying tends to result in a lot more people dying. When I'm more advanced at the game I'll begin to study how the spray patterns work in more detail so I'm not only tapping left click for all my shots but utilizing the spray more effectively as well.If you're playing the Casual game modes, I'd say it's fine to solo queue because it's quite laid back.For Competitive I tend to like to queue up with full lobby or with at least 1 other person. It makes it feel more fulfilling to either share in the victory or the defeat together.For anyone on the fence about this game or gave it up after not understanding why none of their bullets ever landed on their targets: This game might go on sale for $7.50 around Christmas time. For this price or even a price near that, it's a must have in my opinion. Don't spray at your targets when you're starting off. If you don't know spray patterns you'll just get destroyed and will barely be able to kill anyone. Always try to tap in an almost even rhythm if possible so your shots will be more accurate. Don't worry about winning or losing in the casual gamemodes(non-competitive). As far as I've realized so far, people may say things such as ""rekt"" or ""get owned"" but in the end your calibrated rank isn't being affected by these types of matches. Use new player friendly weapons when you're beginning such as the P90 when you're playing with friends that are more seasoned when they want to play actual games. When you are on your own or are doing death match rounds, use the trickier weapons such as the AK47 or AWP in situations where ultimately whatever happens people won't care about as much.I hope this was somewhat helpful. I'm still new but I have found a new love for this game. I'm pretty sure that once I start solo queuing in Competitive at some point that it'll be like Dota 2 where none of my team mates will speak English and things will be... interesting. Well with that said, I'm off to play some more CS GO!",Sat Feb 29 16:51:39 EET 2020,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.69/420",Sun Jan 09 21:39:37 EET 2022,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)-----Update 1------Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :DGood luck and (try to) have fun!----Update 2-----Thanks for all the responses everyone!The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :DI actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!",Sun Dec 26 00:59:05 EET 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

You can read my old review below.Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once.",Wed May 19 22:59:04 EEST 2021,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

I will miss you terribly.Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game.After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did, while not recommending it to anyone at the same time.Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate.Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites.And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered.Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing: Either play always with others, or lose everything you worked for.Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive.It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement.To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories:Casuals: your usual, run-of-the-mill players that team up with a friend or two, or they even may go alone.Premades: Most CSGO players are going in as teams. But, if you are unlucky and bump to a 4 man premade team, you are screwed in most times. Your every mistake will be exploited and become a reason for your team to flame you hard, or even kick you. Very rarely premades will make you feel like an actual part of the team (and these players are worth adding to your friend list).Smurfs: I like to call them the best players the Bane of Global Offensive. Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost.Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost.Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right, smurf accountsIn other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period.Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible.SPOILER ALERT: never open cases, sell them insteadRATING:Gameplay: 8/10 (non-competitive) 3/10 (competitive)Presentation: 8/10Enjoyment (replacing story): 7/10 (non-competitive) 2/10(competitive)Unique Factor: Community: 3.5/10OVERALL: 6.6/10 (non-competitive) 4.1/10 (competitive)Someone get me a match and some alcohol.

Telling in advance - I made long way from hating csgo up to loving it. But anyway, to the point:For people, who don't know what counter strike is, and who never heard about this game before:Counter strike is unique semi-reallistic game, which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups (somali pirates, phoenix connection, etc) and different law enforcement groups (SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, SWAT, FBI etc). Game features several rounds (from 16 up to 32, depends on a gamemode and server rules), where every player have only one life per round. As soon as round time ends, or one of the teams eliminated, round is finished. After every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets (armor, flash and smoke grenades, etc). Game features several game modes:(classic) hostage rescue (maps with ct_prefix):Counter Terrorists must steal hostage (or any of the several hostages) from a place, secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone. As soon as hostage is brought, or whole terrorist team eliminated, counter terrorists win. If time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area, terrorists win. As soon as counter terrorist carries hostage, whone CT team gets extra 1:30 minute time to reach safe place.(classic) bomb defuse (maps with de_prefix):Terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants. Problem is, there's only one bomb per whole team. As soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead, another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point. Counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place, if it's fallen. As soon as bomb is planted, round time stops and to win, counter terrorists must defuse bomb. If bomb is blown, even though all terrorists are dead, terrorist team wins the round.gungame (Honestly, forgive me if I make mistake here, but it's one of the gametypes I barely played): The least teamplay addicted game type. You start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone, you get new weapon. As soon as you come through all the weapons (including knife), you win the map. You instantly respawn after death. I remember there was also gungame gametype, where you had only one life, but gungame is not my cup of tea, so let's finish on this.deathmatch:Also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death. But, unlike gungame, you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life. You should kill as many enemies, as you can. Thanks to respawn in random places of the map, fight itself reminds a messy war, where enemy can shoot you in the back (just because he respawned there) and so on. I don't normally play this gametype aswell, but if I remember right, this gametype was brought by community.Also, community made more gametypes, like zombiemod, bunnyhop (or whatever is it called) and deathrun, where you need to reach some point.Now, for people who played cs for a while. Main differences from cs 1.6 and css here are: partially new weapons, updated radio commands, updated hostage rescue mode, where you need to actually PICK UP only ONE hostage and bring him to the safe place. Weapons have changed physics, so you'll need to learn everything again. And, an old problem, which became more important duo to competative gamemode: CHEATERS! Can't say there are many cheaters, but when you meet them, whole fun is ruined. Same when you meet stupid people.As we reviewed the game (I tried to be as short as possible), I'll express my mind on it:Firstly, I hated this game. It seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy. It had (and it still has) changed radio commands (yes, I was one of those few people, who used radio commands), you couldn't (and still can't) choose your player model (only team, like in css beta), you had and (still have) some grenades, which, probably don't even exist (decoy and incendinary, the molotov analogue, btw molotov here bounces from the wall, wtf?), or at least I was unable to find any info about them. In hostage rescue mode, why would you need to save only ONE hostage? Why would cops leave another one behind? You couldn't place silencer on M4 and 'base ct pistol', or use flashlight and many more things which I couldn't remeber right now. With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation:First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal...And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games.",Fri Jan 14 14:03:50 EET 2022,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

Continuous and spontaneous crashes and other issues (including your aim being locked and you are dropped to 20fps) ruin the competitive experience. The random crashes don't seem to be as common for PC users for whatever reason. Recent updates to the Matchmaking system have now caused lower-ranked players (Silver and Gold Nova) to be continually matched with players with considerably more skill and experience, known as ""Smurfs"" to the community. While these ranking tweaks had good intentions, especially for highly-ranked players (Global Elite, SMFC etc.), they just seemed to amplify the smurfing problem to  a much greater extent. Smurfing ruins the competitive scene, especially for beginners and lower ranked players who have not yet been able to grow and learn to the extent of the experienced 'Smurfs'. While some may acclaim that Smurfing allows players to improve, by playing against players of greater skill, when you lose a gun battle to a smurf, round after round, you're forced to sit and spectate while you wait for the next round to begin. If you are most interested in watching the game instead of being able to play it, watching Professional CSGO tournaments might be your speed. It makes it hard to improve at the game when you are pummeled by a Smurf game after game, day after day.Besides this all, the millions of daily players cannot be wrong. Gameplay is fluent and heavily based on cooperation with teammates. CSGO gives a motivation to improve, to climb the Matchmaking ranks and become the best player you can be. Even the weapon skins add  a huge element to the game that is purely about a virtual economy for aesthetic customisations in-game.CSGO is an immersive experience, and is a great game to play with friends - a game to learn together and grow together to top the ranks of Competitive Matchmaking. However, every game has its flaws. Crashes, gameplay issues and smurfing are amongst the most heinous (and I haven't even touched on the cheaters). Overall, 400 hours of regular playtime speaks for itself, but major issues need to be addressed so that the game becomes more enjoyable for everyone, becomes a more competitive experience and the community can grow together in appreciation of the game.",Mon Aug 31 00:12:48 EEST 2020,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

I suppose it was because of Artifact being a complete disaster. But it would all be a contradiction in that case. Long story short, game developers no longer know what they're doing. First a battle royale mode, and now this...?What actually costs money is thePrime Edition, which pretty much gives you preference in terms of matchmaking. Which means you'll most likely face other players who bought the game more often.The main problem being that, as it is now a F2P game, hackers won't need to pay up to cheat. If they're banned, they can just make another account. Now, to the actual review.The game is good overall. Mostly based on you using your sight and your hearing to locate enemies. And also controlling your weapon's recoil.Although your weapon may seem normal in your screen, the bullet pattern will certainly not be normal, especially if you're used to spray and pray.Of course, there will be moments of tension where aiming a centimeter lower may get you a kill, or get you killed.Toxicity levels aren't high, but they're not low either. It's what you can expect from a game with a competitive scene nowadays. As you no longer need to pay to play it, installing it is up to you.One thing I'll mention though: just tap fire with the AK-47. And if you're using the AWP, you may want to save the ''honor of using a Sniper rifle to headshot people, because that's why the rifle has a scope on it''.Oh, yeah, and RIP everyone (me included) who paid for the game.",Thu May 21 23:43:48 EEST 2020,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response.It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers.The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves.Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community.As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us.""DISCLAIMER: I made this as a joke review because I thought it be creative as hell. This is also to commemorate for the fallen of the Pearl Harbor attack planned by the Empire of Japan, I give credit to FDR for creating the original and thought provoking speech for Congress and the people of the United States. However, I still give this a negative review because I don't agree with valve's instincts of making a BR gamemode to attract a community of children to play this game and the Free to Play option.

The community has inevitably grown to something much more than it was originally intended to be. What do I mean by this? Well I'll point that out.1. The number of hackers/cheaters has only gotten bigger over the years and Valve isn't doing anything about it, unfortunately. Yes, the VAC system works, but there are some cheats out there that are undetectable, an example such as LMAO Box (which is also heavily in TF2). Valve doesn't care about their own community in terms of cheaters/hackers, but they can fix this, by improving the security of their ""reliable"" anti-cheat system. 2. The community is full of trolls and jerks. There will always be at least one or two trolls within a server trhat you currently play in. There always be someone screaming over the mic, cursing out other people, and overall being more or less of a big annoyance. There's nothing you can do about either, you can't mute the person within the game, you have to deal with it or you have to mute your sound or leave to go to another server, which defeats the whole purpose in getting a higher rank. You can also decide to have a poll to have the user kicked off, but this never works. They will always attempt to vote you off if you are caught voting the targeted user off. It's also really annoying when someone voted to reset the server match over 50 times because they died and everyone votes to reset the match. No one cares for other people's enjoyment, they only care about themselves. 3. The economy in this game is demanding. There will always be people asking for things, such as knives, weapon sking and stickers. The first time I heard trading was introduced in this game, I knew it was going to stir trouble. Like TF2, people trade for greed and wealth, not for playing the game for fun. Speaking of which, your always made fun of if you don't have a skin attached to a weapon, not everyone wants those things you know! CS:GO is turning into TF2, Overwatch and COD all at the same time. The community has only gotten worse over the years and Valve isn't doing anything to improve/fix this. I don't want to think of this as another TF2, but unfortunately, that is what it has become and it will likely always be that from now on, because Valve wants all their games to be similar in terms of their other multiplayer games.",Fri Jun 04 20:51:07 EEST 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??",Tue Apr 06 17:34:40 EEST 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

It's late at night and the events of that day seem like they happened so long ago. Yet, I can't get them out of my head right now. Maybe it's just my nerves. Maybe it's the darkness outside. I don't really care, honestly, but I need to get this off my chest. Otherwise, I might not be able to sleep tonight. Damn these memories, I wish they would just go away.It was about eleven years ago when I was in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I was in the seventh grade and I was that kid who wore all black and listened to heavy metal in the back of the classroom. Yeah, I was a goth kid. It seems silly to think about now, but everyone had their own little click when they were in LAN parties, I suppose. The goth scene really appealed to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a kid. I was bullied a lot, even before I decided to wear all black and listen to heavy metal full blast on my walkman. The '♥♥♥♥ everyone else in the world' mantra really suited Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at the time. And, for three of my 'CSGO Buddies', it suited them as well. I guess that's why we got along so well.My CSGO Buddies, two of which I haven't heard from for several years now, were just like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They were goths too. Everyone back then had a clique, I suppose. They were mine. We would spend every waking moment together, both out and in of LAN parties. They were like my strange, outcast family. Well... at least they were. Times change. I still remember their faces clearly. There was Andy, a very tall, robust kid that was the oldest out of all of us. Kyle, my best CSGO Buddy, who was short and very thin. While his frame may have been small, he got into fights -a lot-. He had a fuse the size of a bacterium, and wasn't afraid to give someone he didn't like a black eye. Then there was Billy. Billy was bullied the hardest out of all of us. Braces, pimples, and thick-framed glasses made him the perfect target for bullying. Yet, we four didn't care about anyone else when we were hanging out together. The rest of the world didn't matter; only the next Slipknot album did.I'm rambling aren't I?Well, perhaps I should get to the meat of things then. Where this horrible memory comes from and why I never see those old CSGO Buddies anymore.My CSGO Buddies and I would always go to a park after LAN parties and on weekends to hangout. This park was massive and held a Counter-Strike diamond, a football field, and a soccer field for all of the little kids and their little league games. However, at the edge of this park, was a large wooded area. It was completely cut off from the rest of the park and community. That was where my CSGO Buddies and I would go to hang out. There, no one would see us or bother us. It was the perfect solitude for a couple of goth kids. The strangest thing about this little wooded area, however, was a large, out of place wall that seemed to edge to park. I found out later that the wall was meant to sepaCounter-Strike: Global Offensivee an old World War II factory from the park so that the kids wouldn't have to be reminded of the war, but to a couple of kids growing up in the early 2000's, it was an eerie landmark.The strangest part about the wall... aside from the terrible graffiti, was the seemingly out of place door right in the middle of the wall. The door was completely rusted over and had long lost its handle. The door was more or less part of the stone wall, at this point. I'm not really sure how it was able to stay standing after so many years of disrepair. It was definitely a testament to its forger.Now, I know that this must sound pretty cliché. Yet, I'm sure that whoever is reading this must be pretty curious as to what is behind that door. Well, as fate would have it, it turns out that four goth kids with nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon were also extremely curious as to what was behind that door.That Saturday afternoon, at about four p.m. or so... after the little league Counter-Strike game, I met up with my three bozo CSGO Buddies right by the door, since it was where we usually met. The three had obvious mischievous smiles plastered all over their faces.""Oh, what are you guys planning on doing?"" I asked accusingly, but a smile also stretching over my lips as I looked the three over. Andy grinned devilishly as he picked up a steel Karambit Knife from the tall grass. My eyes widened and my smile widened.""We're opening that door, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I stole this Karambit Knife from my old man's work truck. He's got, like, three of them. He won't even know it's gone."" Andy said laughing a bit. I remember becoming extremely giddy, almost attaining five year old levels of excitement.""Well? What the hell are you waiting for?! Open the door!"" I shouted at him. The other two began encouraging him as well. With a smug look, he placed the Karambit Knife at the frame of the door and began pushing on it. Now, Andy was a big kid and the door was extremely worn down. It didn't take much effort for him to open the door. With a loud crack, the door flung open, and the four of us, dumbstruck, looked into what was behind the door.It was a staircase going down into an incredibly dark basement... or bunker... or something. We couldn't even see the bottom of the stairs because of how dark it was. For about five minutes, we just stared down the concrete stairs in awe. Kyle was the first one to break the silence.""Whoa..."" he spoke, ""It goes down awhile, doesn't it?""""Yeah,"" Billy said, swallowing a bit. ""W-We should go though. Someone must have heard us. We gotta go before they call the cops.""""Oh, don't be such a baby. We've gone this far, we gotta go down the stairs!"" Andy exclaimed. The three of us looked at Andy with worried looks. We may have been goth kids, but we were still kids.""I don't know, Andy. It's pretty dark, and we don't have a flashlight."" Billy said.""Pfft, alright wuss. Go on, Kyle, you go down the stairs.""""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why the ♥♥♥♥ Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? You're the one who opened the door! You go down the stairs!"" He spat angrily. Andy furrowed his brow.""Yeah, and without my Karambit Knife, that door would still be closed, wouldn't it? I already get a free pass on this. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you got here last, you gotta go down the stairs!"" he yelled at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. My eyes widened as my attention turned from the stairs to the three others.""What? Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why? It wasn't even my idea to open the door! I'm not going down there!"" I said, worried.""Come on! Someone's gotta go down. Billy and Kyle are too big of cowards to do it. That leaves you.""""I'm NOT going down there.""""Oh? I can't make you?""""You can't force Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to do it.""""Oh really?""BAM!I felt the large, blunt force of a heavy hand against the back of my head as Andy sucker-punched Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Andy was bigger and, well, let's just say broader than all three of us put together. His punch nearly knocked Counter-Strike: Global Offensive out. In my daze, I remember hearing Kyle shout something as Andy placed his hands on my shoulder and shoved Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I didn't hit the ground like I thought I would. Instead, I just remember falling. Falling down and down into an unfathomable abyss of darkness. He pushed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive down the stairs, but being as light as I was, I never even hit a single concrete step. I just fell, and fell, and fell until I hit the bottom. I hit the concrete floor hard. The impact knocked the wind out of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but, surprisingly, I didn't break any bones or, well, die. The world span and I couldn't even get up, let alone speak.",Sat Jan 15 17:00:26 EET 2022,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer FPS games, where two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, battle for a specific mission. The game was initially a mod for Half-Life, Valve's first game, until the sequels of the game were created some time later.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest game of the series, and today it is the most-popular competitive FPS game ever played. The game is just basically the same as the first Counter-Strike games, but a ton of additions and improvements were done.  Graphics First, the graphics. This is probably the biggest improvement in the series, as the game now looks more pleasing to the eyes, it has smooth movements throughout the game, and there has been a lot of decal improvements. Compared to the earlier games, Global Offensive provides a better and player-friendly nature thanks of today's modern graphics.Of course all of these cannot be achieved if you don't have the requirements to play on a flawless gameplay, but it is believed that it can run even on entry-level PC's.  Gameplay Gameplay. As I have said before, Global Offensive is mostly the same as the earlier games, consisting of the two game modes Bomb Scenario, wherein Terrorists must plant a bomb to a bomb site in a map and the Counter-Terrorists must defend or defuse the bomb if planted, and Hostage Scenario, wherein Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages held by Terrorists.Though there are additionals game modes that can be played. These modes are the Arms Race, Demolition, and Deathmatch. (although I believe these modes can be played on the previous games through a mod)Global Offensive also made changes to the gun system, they have added more guns to the shop and made improvements to them.The sound is still the same as the previous ones, however, around this year they have made changes to the guns' sounds, But the sound from Global Offensive is a lot better and clear than the others. Community The community is what most Valve games' community have. There isn't really much to say here, although it's worth mentioning that the community on this game series is actually more friendly and cooperative than other Valve's games. And since this a competitive game, (I'd say highly competitive), a lot of players are pretty serious on playing since this involves a huge amount of cooperation with the team.Toxicity is somewhat not that visible to the game, so players who are really serious about competitive games are present. Miscellaneous Like DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2, Valve's other popular games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has also what they call the inventory system. Here you can get item drops such as gun skins, gun stickers, and cases where you can get the gun skins and stickers. These items can be used to customize your gun loadout, or sell them to the Steam Market, where you can get money from. (If you are lucky, there are rare items which have high price on the market listings where you can sell those rare items for $$$.) Final Notes Overall, this game is one of the best games out there, for a cheap price, and offers a lot of opportunities to choose how you want to play the game. You could try making yourself into the game and go for the rankings, play casually to pass time, or probably to troll just to relieve stress and have fun for yourself. There is a lot of space for you to improve in the game, but still, like most multiplayer game does, playing this game with friends give the best possible experience and gameplay for the game.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not a pay-to-win game, and if you wanted to spend money on this game, make sure you just make it worth the money you spend on the game.-----------Definitely get this game if you want to get started on competitive gaming, or if you're just looking for a game that is worth the time and money spending. In fact, the most annoying and irritating things that could occur in the game is actually the most hilarious and most fun to deal with.Counter-Strike is a really popular game, so why not just get the game, and shoot down other players and join the fun?",Sun Oct 10 17:42:15 EEST 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

My opinion, however, is that this game's competitive ranking system is total garbage. Now before you go on raging in the replies saying ""ERMAGURD GO BACK TO COD MAD CUZ BAD GET GUD LUL"" please read the following.This system is poorly designed because you constantly have to be paired with good teams in order to win games and thus rank up in your competitive rank. For the uneducated, the more games you win, the more likeley you are to rank up, but if you lose games, you lose your rank. When you are constantly being paired with people who don't have microphones or toxic squeakers who don't know what they're doing, you derank all the way to silver one. The non comeptitive rank literally means nothing and is just there to look nice, which in my opinion should determine which skill group you're in for competitve, but nope. The system Valve built requires you to get lucky and be paired with a decent team that can communicate easily and knows what they're doing, which won't happen unless the planets align during a full moon.So if you don't want to constantly grind competitive matches and face a toxic community filled with tryhards and squeakers, don't download this game.",Sat Sep 11 21:31:28 EEST 2021,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer.

Within 4 hours i reached Rank 3 Battleships, and level 7.I downloaded the game expecting it to be like most other Vehicle Combat games on the market right now, with health bars and just shoot where ur cursor is, and to an extent that's the case here. Now you could say War Thunder has spoiled me with it's Interiors and modular system, but to an tiny degree WoWs has it too with guns being knocked out and fires spreading. But it's not quite up to WT standerds of having each crew being able to be knocked out and shooting at direct points of armour to hit a small ammo rack or feul tank. Now it does Have Armour but not X-ray. Well It keeps me happy that the HP bars aren't too overused.But let's get real here, nowadays EVERYONE talks about Graphics or FPS. For me, BOTH were above average. I got arround 30-40 fps on the highest settings and it looked great ! But still not a solid 60 or 200 ... War Thunder has this issue too, so i will let this one slide.Although the game does hold your hand annoyingly in the first levels. When i started the game, i was fustrated because i couldn't even access the Tech Tree until i was level 2. I spent atleast 20 minutes looking in the game settings and their video tutorials for where the button to it might be hidden. And when i DID get the tech tree open, it's shallow AS ♥♥♥♥. There is like only 10 ships of 1 type per type FOR 3 TYPES or if your lucky and picked America or Japan you get Aircraft carries ......... Even though britain ruled the waves, they still don't have a flushed out tech tree.Now even though the i am from England, and the British Empire did have the largest navy in the tree i could atleast get the famout Hood right ? The biggest ship in the Navy ? Well the Japanese get the Yamato and the Yanks get the Iowa, BUT NO the Hood was made a premium ...

On first launch, my machine ran the game quite choppily, but that was all resolved after altering the settings quite a bit. Nonetheless, I enjoy the variety of ships, and at the moment I'm using the British line. yet every nation's line is relatively balanced.

Unfortunately all things have good and bad sides:Pros:- Amazing graphics for a supposedly ""arcade"" game(Seriously though, they are good even if it was a simulator)- Good audio- Huge playerbase(you usually get into a battle within 1:30 minutes)- Divisions and clans(Good to play with friends)- Huge variety of ships(200+ ships from 8+ nations. Also there are four(4) ship types: Aircraft carrier, Battleship, Cruiser   and Destroyer.)- It has its own fun and adrenalin filled moments.- Lots of third party mods for people who like that kind of stuff.- Very well optimised(It can run quite well on even a old computer)So far so good. But we still have the cons:- LOOOONG grind to tier X(like maybe 3-5 months per LINE of ships)- Matchmaking is a bit of a problem: Sometimes you don't even want to sail in a tier V ship unless you absolutely have to.   Trust me when you're fighting a tier VII ship in a tier V it's hard.- Some people can be salty: Some people might get upset when they get destroyed or if matchmaking does not favour   them. Even i'm salty sometimes when i get one-shotted by someone.- Premium ships: These are ships you have to pay to get. They are usually stronger than the normal mainline variant of the   ship. These are expensive(around 3500 inr for a tier VIII premium battleship).- Premium account: Like premium ships, there is a premium account status that you can pay to get. This gives you   increased credit and XP income. It's a little bit more fairly priced but it's still expensive.Overall, its a great game. Definitely a game i would recommend.

A typical game is, Destroyers charge up, then pop smoke and sit in this spamming torps. Once smoke clears, they pull back, recharge then repeat. Battleships sit as far back lobbing shells.

Now I don't have thousands of hours that many players have on this game but I've played enough that I think at the very least I can write a credible review. A side note though: I'm a killer main but I'll try not to let that affect the review\n\nThere's a lot to take in when you first play the game. I've barely seen any gameplay and have heard very little of DBD prior to buying it. I can't think of any similar game to this and it's pretty unique. Whether you're playing survivor or killer there's a lot of things you need to learn. Map layouts, spawns, looping, and a lot of other things you need to learn in order to get better. A big thing you need to learn, and something I'm personally still learning, are survivor and killer perks. Each side has a large variety of perks to tip the match in their favor and while I can probably memorize all of them by looking them all up and reading over them I don't find that very fun. Over the time I've played I started to memorize some perks but I'm still learning even with 100 hours. There's so many different combinations of perks you can use and it can be fun making a full stealth build or a full hex build.\n\nWith all the perks and characters to unlock the game gets super grindy. I haven't maxed out any of the characters and I still have like more than 75% of the perks to unlock. I bought the bundle that came with some of the survivors and killers already unlocked so I imagine buying the base game alone is even worse. There's a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202099532/recommended/381210/] review [/url] that claims they don't have much unlocked with nearly 1000 hours. That's absolutely insane and the grind of this game probably has to be my least favorite aspect of it. Some characters are DLC exclusive meaning you can only buy them with real money which sucks.\n\nNot all the perks and characters are equal. I find many perks useless and some overpowered. Playing the game you'll see that there's a pretty clear defined meta and a lot of the people use the same perks. The developers are pretty slow to update the game but changes to perks usually happen when they put out patches to balance the game more. Some killers feel stronger than others and I think the devs could do a better job of balancing that but it doesn't seem impossible to win with any of the killers. It's just more difficult with others.\n\nSpeaking of balance, many people claim the game as a whole isn't. I see a lot of people saying that it's survivor sided and I honestly disagree. Now, the way the game works, wins and loses aren't cookie cutter. As a survivor you can technically \""win\"" even if you die because you did a lot of gens and stalled the killer earning yourself with gold or iridescent medals. Likewise, with killer you can achieve the same if you only killed 2 people. I personally give myself the win if I've killed 2 people and the other 2 are on their last life. Using that as a reference, as killer, I'm absolutely positive I've \""won\"" more than half of my matches which is what balance is. I would even say I've killed 3 survivors in 75% of my matches. So, imo in terms of balance the game does a good job. \nBut to be fair, I kinda understand why people may believe killer sucks. Playing as killer can sometimes be really frustrating. Even if I did technically \""win\"" the match, I can't help but feel disappointed knowing I wasn't able to get 2 people and it's worse if it's a 3 or even 4 man escape. \n\nThe story in this game isn't really something I was personally interested in. The game doesn't have like a campaign or anything as it's a purely competitive game but each character has lore you can read about. There's also other stuff like \n the compendium which adds more. I know some people are pretty invested in the lore and find it pretty interesting so if you want some lore to read up on of the game this game has some.\n\nAlright so, I legit have yet to run into a cheater and have encountered very little bugs. I know i haven't played much but with how much people complain about them I would think I would have ran into something by now. I won't deny they exist though. There's a ton of videos you can view online with cheaters and bug complications showing how scuff the game is.

Again, take my review with a grain of salt because I only have 100 hours. I recommend buying this game if you buy the survivor and killer packs or like grinding a lot. Otherwise you'll start playing the game with barely anything unlocked and it's probably gonna suck.

World of Warships is a fun arcade style schooting game featuring World War II ships with 4 ship types to choose from the fast and deadly sometimes stealthy Destroyers to the firebugging cruisers (Royal Navy Light Cruisers are an exception) to the big bullies or the Battleships on the battlefield and finally the deadly raptors of the skies the aircraft carriers.Although I do enjoy playing this game I do have some issues regarding this game Matchmaking From tier 5 onwards the matchmaker will match you +2 tier oppoments from the current selected tier of your ship instead of just 1 tierThis especially becomes a problem at tier 8 as most often you will get matched with tier 10 opponents Playing on Weekends I generally avoid playing this game on weekends as most of your teamates will evolve from potatoes to french fries with lots of salt meaning you'll probably lose more games than you would on a weekday (I think this only applies to the ASIA server the server which I reside. I currently don't know bout the other servers on weekends) TLDR; Save yourself from stress and play another game during weekends unless you want to suffer.  Aircraft Carrier Saipan I don't see this as an issue though more like a heads up But Saipan is the queen of the skies at Tier 7 and the bane of aircraft carrier player when facing against most often the Saipan will win due to the captain having the air supriority skill or just a seasoned CV player is general. So stick to your allied cruisers when you see this premium aircraft carrier in your match,Wed Jul 07 03:33:17 EEST 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

I know its balanced out within the team but for the players that come into a game with a lower tier ship against a superior ship is not my kind of fun. Tier 8 does not exist anymore because your guarenteed to be put in a Tier 10 Battle. My other gripe is that when you work your way up to a desired ship that your after that has just been released, weeks later they will nerf it so all that hard work into thinking your getting the ship that was reviewed is removed, they should fully test the ship before reviewing it. Numerous occations i have worked hard to get these ships then in comes the nerf which makes the ship totally crap.Other than these gripes the game is awesome, i have played since the beta and have progressed through most of the ships.

Outfit your fleet with flags, camouflage, modifications, talented commanders, and more!World of Warships is one of the World of X titles in Wargaming portfolio, next to World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. It's a clash of 16-24 ships in PvE bot battles, scenario missions or PvP combat. You take control of a ship - quick and agile destroyer, slow and tanky battleship, somewhere-in-between cruiser or a plane carrier - and destroy other ships while trying to control strategic points on the map.WoWs looks very pretty and if you're interested in navy battles just play it. It's free after all. If you don't know if you're interested... It's a rather slow and strategic, mostly PvP, naval fight game. It's extremely fun even if you don't like PvP games and it can really suck you in. It's a squad based game, so your enjoyment greatly depends of the quality of your team. If your team is bad you will lose. Most often than not it's not possible to carry and, as there are no respawns, the margin for error is slim, even if you're amazing but have a bad team you will fail. And failing is not fun. I have to say I have a love hate relationship with this game as I love the idea, looks, music and pretty much everything, but bad teams make me hate it very much. For that hate moments there are bot battles though, these are easier and more fun even if less rewarding.As to the f2p aspect. The game can be enjoyed free for a long time. Having said that mind that in higher tiers - there are 10 - you can lose in-game money, needed for resupply, when playing normally. You can gain money playing lower tiers though, so it's not like you have to pay to play. If you want to pay the game can be extremely expensive with ships costing up to 50 euro per one (that's normal for these kind of games unfortunately, WarThunder is the same). Real world money gives you some more in-game money (needed for resupply and parts), xp (for captain skills) or cosmetics, but doesn't give you any additional power (like special ammo). Also while you can buy premium ships for money without any grinding you will not be proficient enough to succesfully play them. And most of them are great for collectors but so so for competitive play.One more thing, you have to invest time into the game. To not suck much in PvP you'll need ca. (20hrs * tier) of playtime, more or less, so for tier V you'll need about 100hrs of playtime to be proficient enough not to be a burden. Your milegae may vary.I liked:* looks, everything looks sooo pwetty* music* bot matches are fun and relaxing* PvP matches are fun and keep you on edgeI disliked:* it's multiplayer so expect lots of salt* if your team is bad you might not have any fun at all (most teams are bad)Get this if:* you're interested in navy battles and history, lots of classic ships like Perth, Yamato, Bismarck, Warspite, etc.* you like PvP games that don't require twitch reflexes* you like to watch pretty boats in a large pond (if you're less competitive just play low tier bot matches and enjoy)Don't get this if:* you cannot stand the salt in PvP* you cannot stand the grind (~100hrs are needed to get not bad, way more to get good; ~300hrs to get to tier 10 ships without buying premiums)",Sat Feb 27 04:15:24 EET 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

It's visually engaging, the ships handle well, particularly the fast cruisers they start you off with and timing your shots requires real skill. Finding a game is easy and level up fast and unlock quite a few ship classes rapidly, giving you a firm handle of the mechanics pretty fast: Battleships are slow and heavy hitting, Destroyers are fast and fire torpedoes, Cruisers mix speed with heavy cannons and Carriers play like a simple RTS, with you directing planes to attack enemy ships from the map.However, that's all it ever is. When you get Carriers at around level 4 you have experienced all the gameplay mechanics you ever will, which is unforunately the point at which you are expected to seriously grind to unlock the remaining 6 levels of ships. Each ship class has at most one or two abilities, none of which makes for a really compelling mechanic in themselves, and these don't really change as you level up. There's none of the diverging options you get from a MOBA, nor are the base classes particularly engaging either. Sure, the higher levels become more powerful or handle differently, but every battleship will be slow and hit hard, regardless of level 10 or level 4. There are zero differences in their skills. Unless of course you buy the upgrades or earn them through lootboxes.I honestly don't have a problem with the Pay2Win elements. Do I think the upcoming Stalingrad battleship and its unashamed overpoweredness stinks? Sure. But they aren't egregious at the low levels, and only become a problem at higher levels, which you will need a lot of patience to reach. There are obligatory loot boxes, but the stuff they provide again felt incredibly pointless, particularly when if your ship sinks it loses most of the upgrades on it. Honestly, considering that the flags and camo patterns add colour to an overwhelmingly grey game, it is a bit of shame that they are lost when your ship sinks. It would be much more interesting if they were permenant, purely visual, upgrades. In a game where only a few ships survive most games, it does make these upgrades feel trivial.There are a few remaining gripes I have.  The game REQURIES teamwork to be fun, but the devs have failed to create the tools which would engage the audience sufficiently in this. Being able to see the paths of your allies would be great. Being able to see what upgrade they are packing would make teamwork much easier. There is so much MISSING from this game's mechanics, which is baffling, as the devs have spent a lot of time and effort on the many ship classes. The carrier gameplay is dull. Incredibly dull. If you lose your fighters because your team didnt coordinate AA fire on the enemy fighters, then you are completely hobbled for the rest of the game as your bombers are picked off by the enemy. If you manage to succeed at gaining air superiority then be prepared for pointing bombers at targets on the map view for the whole game. To give you an idea: take Supreme Commander. Lock yourself to the most zoomed out view. Give yourself only 3 units. See how long it takes you to get bored. You essentially have WoW's Carrier game. There are a decent array of maps and gametypes, but they all play the same. There are objectives, but realistically they all boil down to deathmatch as the lack of a respawn means that if you knock out a battleship you're in a better position then capping the objective. So everyone just steams for an objective or two, the destroyers get knocked out first, then the battleships and cruisers arrive and slug it out. Every. Time.TLDR:A great base mechanic which invovles predicting the pace of enemies and positioning your ship which is unfortunately let down by a complete lack of creativity or style when it comes to the other mechanics.

Wargaming. This is an awful company you should think twice about throwing money at. WoT is notoriously infamous for it's inbalances and P2W policies. Gladly WoWS is not nearly as broken as WoT, but since we're talking about WG it's only a matter of time if you ask me. 2. Playerbase. It's not the toxicity, it's the unbelieveable incompetence that breaks the game, especially on weekends when all our beloved weekend warrios login. ""Blame the players, not the game"" is especially true in this game. Yes, the game is flawed, but ultimately what breaks the game is the people playing it. The second issue could easily be resolved by either implementing skill based MM or making ranked play more available (It's limited to short periods of time and specific tiers only).Unfortunately WG relies on those masses of extremely bad players, who godknowswhy oppose skill based MM, as source of income since the game is F2P, so nothing will change. The game has potential, also for the esports scene, but as usual it's being dumbed down for casuals and maximum profit.",Wed Dec 29 01:47:01 EET 2021,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

In order to unlock the other battleships you need to play as the kawachi first, this means you're the most disadvantaged player on the battlefield, most destroyers can literally beat you just by sniping you from miles away giving you no chance of ever hitting them. So you're literally forced to kamikaze as a battleship(Second biggest ships to aircraft carriers btw) hoping you do some damage or get a kill, then play on your phone until the battle finishes and finally you can repeat the process until maybe after an afternoon and ngiht you have a slightly better ship (The miyogi IV) which is still awful. You might say ""Well they offer premium ships"" and you'd be correct, I saw this option and decided to buy a tier IV class battleship(that severely outclasses any regular teir IV battleship i might add) for $6 to get myself on the ground and skip the awful grind of the kawachi, for about 6-7 hours i played as my new ship and had some of the most fun a warship game has ever given me, smooth controls, fast ship, accurate and long range weapons only to realize after gaining around 11,000xp that none of that can be spent on the tech tree unless you convert the XP with the in game purchased currency. Which is absurd seeing how i paid for the ship, now i have to pay to use the experience i gained with the ship? How is that fair, that solidates the fact i will never buy anything else on this game because the standard it sets is just purchasing your way through the teirs whenver you start losing too much. And i get why they make the frist few battleships difficult to grind through, because they know if it was as easy as just playing a tenryuu everyone would just play as the battleships. but still they're making their point way too hard. and the fact that i feel like Forrest Gumps shrimping boat could body me definitely rubs me the wrong way.

This is not a good game, and the publisher/developer behind it is not worth supporting. This game sells a power fantasy to the highest bidder and keeps people engaged through the same triggers as a slot-machine.In short: The game itself suffers from horrendous balance issues and blatant pay-to-win problems. The developers have consistently been deceiving, insulting, and even threatening the playerbase. The game is player-vs-player focused. It features ships from various points in time. There is a progression system for advancing up tiers in a tech-tree. There are numerous different tech trees for different nations. You earn credits and XP from battles - winning, killing ships, dealing damage, capturing objectives, and spotting enemies all award you varying amounts of credits and XP. In a battle, you can have ships of various nations and various types distributed amongst 2 teams. Furthermore, you can have ships of varying tiers. Up to tier 4, you will always either be in a highest tier ship or only ships one tier above yours in the battle. Starting at Tier 5, ships can be up to 2 tiers higher than yours. The higher tier the ships, the more powerful they are. So the game is inherently designed around you wanting to get to higher tier ships, so you can more easily beat your opponents. If you are in a Tier 10 cruiser facing off against a Tier 8 cruiser, you will probably win - same if you are in a Tier 10 Destroyer, Battleship, or Aircraft Carrier. You can either try to make the most of your ship and let yourself be pummled over and over again by higher tier ships (with the occasional game where you are the one beating the lower-tier enemies), or you can pay money to skip past lower tier ships rather quickly and directly upgrade to higher tier ships. The higher your tier ship, the better the odds of you being in a top-tier match. However, ship progression is far from the only progression present in the game. In fact, it's probably one of the least important progression systems present in the game. What probably amounts to the most important progression system is the captain system. On any ship, you can slot a captain. This captain gains XP along with your ship - and once you accrue enough XP, you unllock a skill point for him to spend. These captain skills are incredibly powerful - making your ship that has a seasoned veteran just straight up better than the equal tiered opponents you face that do not have a captain of their own to match yours. If you wish to advance to a ship and take your captain along, your captain suffers what is called ""retraining"". During this time, you need to play with the captain on your ship to grind out XP to ""familiarize"" him with the new ship. The problem? The more you invested into your captain before, the longer retraining takes on a new ship. Except you can spend money to by-pass this problem entirely. Keep in mind that these captain skills are not trivial. There are entire ship classes (like destroyers or light cruisers) for whom these captain skills are essential to deal damage and survive. Without the correct captain skills, they are simply anemic XP and credit Pinatas for the enemy team. Additionally, Wargaming (the developer/publisher) has  the habit of continously powercreeping content with new ships released. That means that unless you invest an unfeasible amount of time into this game or fork over vast quantities of money, the line you are grinding will easily be obsolete in a few months, displaced by something that is just straight up better. They will milk the paying players for money and let them have overpowered ships for a few months. They eventually nerf these ships once the people who are likely to spend money to get them have done so, and then announce a new line a month or two later that will repeat the cycle. Additionally, this game features premium consumables and premium ships. Premium consumables are buy-for-each-battle items, that are direct upgraded versions over regular consumables. You can either pay exorbitant, non-sustainable amounts of in-game credits for, or you can pay real money for premium account time, premium camoflagues, buy in-game currency, or premium currency, all of which enable you to continously use these consumables. Premium ships are ships that you can only attain by paying money for them. They are virtually never changed from their initial state. They are typically released along with new ship lines. This means that while newly released regular ships are just as good as the premium counterparts, the premium ships will remain overpowered, while the regular ships are subject to balance changes. Just think about that; if you pay real money for a ship, it will never be nerfed. In a PvP game. When players point out the disparity between regular ships and premium ships, the developers will do any combination of the following things:    Remove the ship from sale, but not the game - usually with a ""buy now before you can't"" announcement  Degrade the players for ""just being bad"" and ""not being good"" (a blatant lie - the premium ships are just superior in stats)  Censor threads and videos calling them out, and even threaten legal action. None of this even addresses the combat in this game, which is absolutely attrocious. All guns you shoot in this game have dispersion. Absolutely staggering amounts of dispersion. We are talking ""divine intervention"" levels of dispersion here. (https://youtu.be/0Ae6B7C05Nk?t=1m6s) You can be randomly one-shot from a single shell striking your ship. Fires and flooding (damage over time effects) are based off of chance. And you can pay real money to skew the chances in your favor. ""Oh boy, will the salvo I just fired instantly obliterate that ship over there?"" The sound effects in the game itself mirror those you might hear on slot machines. Big explosions, sounds effects, and all. This game is fundamentally manipulative, deceiving, and exists to give a power fantasty to those willing to pony up the cash. I would go so far as to label it and its makers as evil. Please, do not play this.",Thu Oct 28 20:47:16 EEST 2021,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

Only downloaded the steam verison for convenience.The game is very visually impressive, i don't think i've seen anything more beautiful in a vido game than firing a full broadside in a battleship, or having your machine guns light up enemy aircraft.The issue i have is the gameplay. PvP is extremely passive, slow and unfun, for me at least. Wargaming seems to have an inconsistant method of applying ""realism"" to the game. They make the ranges for primary guns realistic (but not the sceondaries, for example) to the detriment of gameplay.WoWs is devided into 4 classes. A generalist class, being the Cruiser, a Support Class, being the Aircraft Carriers, and 2 Specialist Classes, being the Destroyers and Battleships, holding the roles of Harassers/Pickers and Tanks respectivly.Battleships, the ""tank"" class, has the highest Armor and Health, and the most powerful Primary Guns, as well as a large compliment of secondary guns for use at close range. A big issue here is that Batlleships primaries are also the longest ranged weapons in the game, which is realistic, but feeds into a few major issues. A High-Health class with that has a long-ranged attack is, by nature of the long range weapons, encouraged to hang back at maxium range to pick people off with the high burst-damage attacks, rather than push in and brawl with opponents at close range, as the secondary armament, as well as the supposed teamplay and counterbalance between Battlehsips and other classes such as the more versitile curiser would entail. From this you might conclude that battleships are Overpowered, but, removing thier range advantage, they're really not. With thier pluses comes their minuses. Battleships have the tankiest armor and health, but also have poor speed and trash manuverabaility. Thier Primaries are powerful sources of damage, but require a long time to reload inbetween shots, generally around 30 seconds per shot, and turn extremely slowly. Secondaries provide useful support damage at close range, but can *only* fire at close range, and are very innacurate, especially against small a nimble destroyers.All these weaknesses would be very exploitable in close-range battles, but because the Battleship's long range can allow it to sit well outside close range battles, rendeirng all these weaknesses irrelavant. Slow reload time and turret turn speed would hurt a brawling Battleship's ability to respond to new targets attacking at different directions, but because the Battleship is at long range, there's only ever one direction it needs to face. New targets are always a quick couple of degrees of turn away. Anything past that, and you're out of position, and will get focused or ambushed to death. Poor secondary range and accuracy is only a factor to consider if secondaries are given the oppuritunity to fire, which a Battleship at long range never provide. That minor extra damage isn't considered worth pushing forward to get focused by enemy long-range fireCruisers are the generalist class, supposedly good at everything, but not *great* at anything. It's medium damage, but fast-reloading primaries ideally would make great support fire for allied ships in brawls, being particularly decent at attacking destroyers, and chiping away at Battleships with fire damage form explosive shells, as well as providing specialized anti-air support against enemy fighters. The long range of battles hurts Cruisers, however.Cruisers have less range than thier Battleships counterparts, and so generally play second fiddle to them if they are present, relying on numbers advantages to attack enemy Battleships, since they cannot take advantage of map terrain due to the longer range, and so sit at a ""meh"" grade of power in the game.Destroyers, the Picker and Harasser class, are represented as the rock-paper-scissors counter to Battleships, which they are... at close range. Thier torpedos deal heavy, heavy damage depsite being slow-moving, which battleships (and some larger cruisers) at close range are generally unable to avoid very easily. But because, like we've well established by now, Battleships, and now Cruisers have no reason to come into close range, Destroyers are relegated to a vulture role of patiently wiating behind map terrain waiting for someone to overextend so they can be ambushed, since closing the distance regularly is a harder task. Destroyers have the highest manuverability and speed of any ship class in the game, as well as the smallest and thus hardest-to-hit profile, which gives them an advantage at avoiding slow-moving enemy shells at a distance, as well as the ability to deploy a smokescreen to provide artificial cover for themselves and teammates, but all of trivial effect if they are not within fighting range to begin with. All it takes is one lucky Battleship volley to take down a lightly-armored destroyer, and if an enemy destroyer at range is always inside an enemy Battleship's line-of-sight, a hit will happen at some point.Aircraft carriers, the indirect fire support class, are affected by the range issue in both ways. By nature of controlling planes in an rts-like fahsion, Carriers have the freedom to sit at extreme ranges, letting thier planes quickly fly to thier targets over the heads of allied ships, exceeding the range of even battleships by technicality. Carriers however, have no primary guns with which to defend themselves, armed with only secondary guns, if any at all, making them very vunerable to focus fire when in-range of an enemy, and so, like battleships, are encouraged to sit at maximum range, generally behind an island, or at the edge of the map. This is an issue in a couple ways. Firstly, it causes aircaft support to have long periods of downtime, as planes must travel long distances to and from thier target, reducing thier ability to play the game, and relegating aircraft to an ocasional danger to outliers in the group, rather than a near-constant threat that affects player positioning and movement, even if Aircraft are a powerful weapon. The second issue is that, again, carriers have poor abilities to defend themselves, and so, unless guarded by an escort willing to take themselves out of the battle, are essentially screwed if any enemy ship - generally destroyers - finds them at thier end of the map; Carriers are unable to recieve the passive support of thier teammates due to the danger of ranged focus fire, and so in turn are less able to support thier teammates.For these reasons, I personally find PvP to be very stale, passive and unfun. Matches very often pass the 20 minute limit due to how slow games are. I personally find Co-Op and PvE gamemodes to be more enjoyable, for the simple reason that Bots aren't afriad to be agressive. In PvE gamemodes, a double-broadside of secondary fire is not uncommon, and gameplay is more dymaic by way of taking advantage of the map layout. But due to how dumb/easy bots are, and due to the reduces rewards you get from PvE modes means your progrssion is going to be painfully slow unless you play a lot of PvP, which, for the pace it has, does not really interest me.And, attempting to discuss the issues (that i find are issues at least) in the community has, in my experience, generally been met with indifference or been provided with non-answers such as ""get good"", and the developers don't seem to be in a position to change thier game on these issues, probably due to popularity issues in the echo-chamber compettitive/higher tier players.Play it if you like playing slow, passive games i suppose.",Tue Aug 03 14:14:15 EEST 2021,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

I used to love this game but the mmr is just not fun at all It's an absolute joke. This game isn't meant for mmr and it needs to so desperately go back to how it was. This game needs a heavy balance check until they implemented mmr and needs to stop NERFING killers. The Killer is meant to have pressure as it is a 1v4 element the killer is already at a disadvantage from the start anymore nerfs to them makes it far more worse then it already is. If the game is meant to appease casual players like the devs say get rid of mmr. I loved this game ever since it came out in 2016 I genuinely want this game to go in a healthy direction but so far it really hasn't. The game needs to balance in both aspects not just survivor not just killer but for both sides and if I'm being honest I'm seeing this game go more toward survivors than anything. Once the game does go in a more healthy direction I would recommend playing it even with friends it's enjoyable but for killer it is usually never fun or enjoyable to play as it is a constant stressful experience.""",Thu Nov 11 14:54:09 EET 2021,16c54f00-1cb1-4c8d-9cc7-38895a645882

Tactics, situational awereness and careful aim are key, not reflexes.As with all team-play based PVP games, you do get into bad teams - it is what it is, not the game's fault. But in general I think the community is decent.Graphics, music is fantastic, well optimized game. Servers are great, matchmaking is fast.Love of these magnificent ships can be certainly felt, there are dev-made historical videos on YT - there is a fair chance you will get interested in the topic.

(I do not feel anyone should spend real money on this game) So I bought the ship and the AI came after me almost instantly by passing other ships. I was sunk in the first few min of the first 3 matches. Keep in mind before using this ship I would almost always last the full match with out being sunk!. SO i put it to the test. I was last into the battle and made sure others shot first at the AI (the carrier and Battleship held back at range so they where not in the heat). I opened with one volley and 3 AI ships instantly targeted me and sunk me!

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections.

And WG used this ""reason"" to chat ban me.OK, chat banned, no problem. So I contacted the supporting staff to remove the ban. Do they have the authority or ability to remove the ban? Sure, I have seen some other players' chat ban been relieved after contacting supporting guys. But this time, the supporting guy (A*** M*****) said they were incapable to remove chat bans.So that guy obviously lied about what they can do, and I pointed it out. You guess what happened? WG simply said, WG wouldn't talk about whether he lied or not, but two sentences twice per battle is SPAMMING and that deserves a chat ban. And by the way, I was suspended from the game 3 days for unsportsmanship even tho I did not violate any WG's rules (https://worldofwarships.com/en/news/gamestuff/anti-abuse-system/) about unsporting conducts.OHHH nice, pointing out they are lying and they get me game banned. And banned by ""Unsporting Conduct"". Am I really surprised to see this? Unsportsmanship! I guess that word means differently in cold weather.

If you are drawn to it by KantaiCollection like me, you will marginally be disappointed but nevertheless still impressed by it, and hey the mods can fix your addiction, even through the mods are of extremely poor quality, the limitations placed on them are a factor i presume, for me slapping kancolle(and other) art on ship skins is indeed poor quality.While all is good and the game is satisfying to play, WarGaming themselves are taking it in the wrong direction since the beginning and that shows, part of it has to do with insane 40 to 60 euro prices for ONE premium ship, the only vanilla skin in the game so far is the Bismark skin which you cant get anymore, and camouflages which are a consumable that pretty much ruin the look of ships to me. They have done a good job with the Halloween event ship skins for one mission available during halloween, but that is it. Personally i feel like ships skins and maybe even voice packs(preferably in cooperation with kantai collection team) would be the right direction instead of ultra expensive ships.Okay aside from that, you got premium account benefits which frankly are equivalent to nothing. Let me put it like this, the major problem you will inevitably face is buying a new ship which requires EXP obtained only and only by the previous ship in a line of tiers to unlock the next tier, and game currency to buy the next ship. The EXP itself is a massive grind you have to go through at high tiers, especially for casual players ( i play for 2 and now close to 3 years casually and i still only just got to tier 9 out of 10, getting to 10 is much harder due to: read on), and CREDITS(game currency) the game offers you a insane ammount at the start to buy your ships, this will take you to atleast tier 7 maybe as you get some from grind too. Now heres how it works, you get credits, like exp, from participating in battles(grinding) roughly around 50k to 100k on a good game, and lets be real you wont be as good as youtubers of this game and be the carry to get a more than that, the problem again rises when you reach tiers 8,9,10 where the cost(yes there is a credits cost) to enter a battle with X ship is pretty much higher than the credits reward for winning/losing the battle, this becomes extremely obvious with tier 9 ships where even if you win, if you plaid poorly you are still in the negative... so... the tiers at which the game is most fun, the developers pretty much said no to that.Now what im getting at is premium account time MARGINALLY fixes this, you get more EXP per battle so theres less grind, and more money and lower deployment cost(participating in game) this basically makes it like this, people say its efficient for non premiums to farm with tier 5-6 for money to buy and play tier 9-10 ships, and this is an insane grind ( i forgot to mention credit costs to buy ships go from 5 million at lower tiers to over 10 million credits for tier 9 or 10 )  so instead, with premium account time, you can farm money with tier 6-7 without losing money if you dont win the game.Theres EXP conversion cost which means you convert EXP accumulated with a ship ( the one you grind with duh ) to something called Free EXP that can instead be used to unlock ( and then buy if you got the credits ) any ship, this costs real money currency and the same system is in place for commanders and resetting commander skills (im not going to get into this) both of which have a decent cost, but the cost being decent is a direct result of how insane the grind has to be in the first place, which is not a good thing. On top of which you dont outright buy Free exp, commander EXP.. etc, you first grind it and pay to convert it to, hopefully, be used on buying t9 and 10 only.All in all a very great core game with rotten wargaming elements, i do recommend it because its extremely satisfying to play, the explosion sounds which they keep improving, that time you get citadel hits(massive dmg) all is very fun to play and everyone should give it a try.",Sat Jan 15 15:08:51 EET 2022,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

For example, all Japanese cruisers from level 5 have a 203 mm caliber of guns, all Americans are 150 mm, and so on.It is clear that it is very difficult to think up differences of similar ships in general, so that the user has a feeling that they are all different, but why then as many as 10 levels.In addition to not understanding why a ship similar in general costs twice as much as it is at a higher level, the balancer throws all the players with a difference of 2 levels of technology in one battle.Those. 5 lvl plays with 7 lvl, 7lvl with 9lvl and so on. Beginners suffer and are angry with the developers. To all other things, the modules of the purchased ship are initially rather weak, and when buying tops the ship, as a rule, is transformed. Gets penalties for perks and a transplanted captain.As a result, the player swims with a slow recharge, turn of the steering wheel and other joys of life and the development of developers in vain.Why this was doing and injuring the players, it is unclear. Maybe the developers themselves were traumatized in their childhood and they harbored resentment?It was possible to make 3 levels - beginners, everything that floated before the 2nd world, middle class - the most massive second world and paper projects like high-level content for clans, etc.As a result, new players enter the game and set themselves a goal to pump the conditional Yamato, for which it is necessary to collect more than 1,000,000 experience points. At the same time, there are both playable ships in the branch, as well as frank cacti, which the developer is rumored to introduce, so that players pass them for free experience through donate.Rushing up to Yamato, it becomes obvious that it was just a trap of developers, because the game on it, as on any top ten gives a stable minus even with a premium account. As a result, in order to ride on the top you need to farm silver on the ships, and this is a separate topic.Regarding the prema, I still do not get tired of being surprised by the logic of the WG. You make a technique that, according to the logic of your game, users will have to play the lion's share of time, to accumulate money and experience on it and to pump the captain.Why, then, does the technician necessarily have a flaw that makes it uncomfortable with respect to conventional ships.Why am I buying a tank or a ship for $ 50 I do not get a sense of advantage, and even vice versa.Separately, I want to say that the premium strategy is also used by the VG to replenish online at certain levels of the game with intent. In brief I will say that in the game 2 comfortable levels of technology - 4LVL and 7Lvl.4 level is comfortable, because by the mechanics of the game it throws a maximum against 5, so you will not have much superiority over you. Especially since level 5 throws on the feed to 7, so on the four you will often play in the top or among the brethren.7 level is comfortable because although it throws to the nines, but there are not enough of them in the rand, since it is economically unprofitable to play them. Therefore, he often plays against 8 prizes or even in the top.It would seem that in this scenario, it is enough to buy 4 or 7 Prem and calmly farm on it with a high percentage of victories. And now we open a premium store and what we see. At 4 corpses only 1 premier battleship Ichizuchi - absolutely unplayable ship, which is worse than classmates in everything. Battleship without armor, which also removed the range.At level 7 there are 3 destroyers, two cruisers and a German battleship. There are 2 more aircraft carriers, on which the gameplay is very specific. Battleship is not bad, if you do not take into account its 283 mm guns. The destroyers are generally good, but it is understandable that Main players will not choose them. Cruisers I generally believe in this game is garbage.The main vehicles are located at the least comfortable 6 and 8 levels. Playing at 6 you will constantly fall against 8 levels and feel complete impotence. Playing 8 will use you to feed damage to 10 lvls. That is, when buying 8 premi it is necessary not to rejoice, but to grieve, since you will not see any comfortable game on it for a long time.After all the nagging above there is a logical question, why do I recommend this game, whether it is worth it to play at all.The fact is that in my games I first of all are interested in the process of cognition, understanding of game mechanics, choosing the most effective options for gaining an advantage over the enemy. And WOWs all this generously provides.The key parameter is the percentage of wins, it shows how many fights your team has won.And although it may seem that the victory of a team of 12 people does not depend on the efforts of one person, but this is not so.The fact is that playing well and influencing the battle can significantly increase the chance of winning your team and have the status 60+ in a solo game.Here is the implementation of this task and keeps me in the game, makes it interesting for me.How to achieve this task?First of all, one must understand that the current level system is broken and not all classes of ships in this game are equally good. In other words, 95% of the ships are frank garbage.Of those that are even good, many are not suitable for the game because of the uncomfortable level of fighting, for example, 5.6.8 levels are not suitable due to the +2 level of combat. 10 are not suitable because of the negative economy. There are 4, 7 and the ninth levels.On the 4th level, Izyaslav and Isokadze are good ships.In the seventh, almost everything, depending on the style of the game.On the ninth I did not play, but I can highlight Missouri as a prem with good stats, to which one should strive to accumulate free experience in an amount of sky-high 7500000.Regarding the role in battle - the destroyers affect the fight very much, as the meaning of this game is in capturing points and gaining advantages over points.The success of the game depends on whether you can live to the end of the battle, while doing considerable damage and not getting it in response, grabbing the points and not letting the enemy do it.It is of course important to kill, but since the size of the cards is large, you can kill a lot and still lose on points.As a match, I really like the game, it allows you to think, make informed decisions during the battle and enjoy the result.

However, it isn't as cheesy as the first Deus Ex, which is in my opinion kind of a downside, as that was also one of the greatest charms of the game.\nBut anyway, the story is really good, it also puts recent games bowing their heads to it, and yet again it is no match to the first Deus Ex. Still, the story is really damn good, with many twists, locations and loads of characters and backstory items to find in the game.\nAlso, that many things have actually consequences later on is very interesting, as it can change many things around, prompting to play through the game more than once.\nNow, onto the gameplay, I can say again that nothing will ever triumph over the original, but Human Revolution does a damn good job in modernising the gameplay in an actually good way. The covering system works kinda well, and as Human Revolution greatly promotes stealth gameplay, it is really fine on that front for avoiding the enemies. \nGoing with a textbook frontal assault works too, as you can have many vastly different weapons at your disposal, which are almost all upgradeable throughout the game.\nAlso, takedowns are really sastifying to do, althrough they can get a bit tedious after a while.\nAnother mostly rambled on point are the boss battles, how they are unavoidable and all, but really, you just gotta gear up  for that, much like bossfights in Metal Gear Solid.\nThrough I must admit that they aren't all that memorable as in Deus Ex 1999 and in MGS.\nAlso, this game is long, especially for this gaming generation.\nGreat music has always be a staple of the series, and Human Revolution is no stranger to that, as the music is worthy of the series.\nIn short, get this game already, it may not be the perfect follow-up to its legendary predecessor from 1999 (We don't mention Invisible War, that wasn't worthy of the name) , but it does one hell of a job introducing this generation to the series.""",Wed Dec 01 06:21:21 EET 2021,9880c50d-ffda-4cad-8311-0ab8fc5844f6

There are some bad reviews regarding that you can't play your old account on steam and what they don't know is that all you have to do is change the Steam file ""Steam_api"" by adding a ""2"" infront of file's name to play with your old account and there some youtube videos in where you can find it and change it.There are four classes of ship Battleships (BB), Carriers (CV), Destroyers (DD), and Cruisers (CL/CA) and there is Premium ships for all four classes of ship. Also if you want to get premium ships they do rotate premium ships by Tech tree refreshers in January and September every year otherwise the other way to obtain them is by limited time sales. Ships like the Arkansas can't be purchased, and OP ships like the Konig Albert and the Nikolai can't be purchased at all.For Carriers I Recommend playing Tier 4-5 carriers first in PvP/PvE and and practicing strafes with fighters and Alt attacks with Strike aircraft in Tier 6 with PvE first before being commited to carriers in PvP. There are youtube videos to help you be a better CV player in the game.When you are in Destroyers and Cruisers and have torpedoes (this also includes battleships with torpedoes) look at your torpedo range first before going into battle and also be careful launching your torpedoes when allies are near as if your not careful by these two things you'll be accidently teamkilling your own team and you'll turn pink at one point playing these ships.Battleships are a classes that relies on their main guns doing all the work and have the armor to soak up damage. AP by fare does more damage than HE, but HE does create more fires. Use AP for broadsides and when the enemy BB is angled bow on towards you use HE unless you are in a Yamato. Not every Battleship has the same armor, take the tier 5 American battleship New York for example, it uses the all or nothing armor concept, to do heavy damage towards all or nothing Battleships in a Battleship hit the area of the aft and stern and between the aft/Stern and citadel to do maxium damage there. When fighting ships like the Bismarck that has the Turtleback armor scheme, it's more difficult getting citadeled at close range but in return it's vulernable to plunding fire. One trick in fighting ships like the bismarck in a battleship is instead of aiming at the waterline aim a little higher towards the upper belt you'll do a more damage there. If in a Cruisers or Destroyer use HE unless you have torpedoes to use against the BB. I don't want to make my review too long, this game is great but it does have it's flaws but I do recommend it.",Mon Dec 13 09:13:08 EET 2021,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

There are sometimes people not playing 'by the book' and we loose. Sometimes that person is me, othertimes not. It's much about learning to play each class of ship, which have their own role and characteristics. Having someone equally advanced as you by your side is more fun than playing against much easier or much harder opponents.The challenges in this game is, however, not the gear, but the strategy (overall plan) and the tactics (battles). There is an invisible range from enemy ships you should try not to cross too far alone, if so, you will sink before you know it, especially if several ships target you.  Observe the range where others may detect you and the range of your main artillery. Also, keep an eye at the map now and then, to avoid being trapped alone against many.This is a not so social game.

You know before many conflicts whether you have engaged on superior footing or lesser than your opponent(s). This is because the pace of entering most conflicts(for the observant, and discarding careless play) is very casual and the pace of the combat itself is relaxed. When you are winning or loosing a conflict, you are already reflecting on earlier parts of the conflict - positioning, speed of entry, bearing of your guns, state of your torpedos or repair kits or smoke bombs, the decisions you made to enter the conflict at all based on your vehicle, nearby allies' vehicles, proximity to allies and the enemies, and the types of vehicles the enemies are in. It's a learning experience to loose, and like writing out a trig proof to win. The proofs available are different by every feature of an encounter. You grow your knowledge of the proofs by loosing a specific setup, and thinking about what variables could've been changed to make it either avoidable, escapable, or beatable. You also think about the other side of it - how you could embrace a certain set of variables for an assault, and how you could do it better or support it if an ally attempts it.",Tue Sep 28 14:12:06 EEST 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

The Ai destroyers are immune to torpedo hits, they phase through the ship but if a player uses one.. torpedo's can hit and almost sink your destroyer immediately. I have watched the Ai, they do a fairly good job of dodging even though they can't be hit in the first place.

The game runs smoothly on my pc wich is a fairly old and cheap one, looks good, sounds good, plays good and doesnt have many bugs. The gameplay reminds a bit of a moba, but then again, not quite. Also reminds a bit of chess, in real time, where every piece is controlled by one person, but then again, not quite.A standard battle has a 12v12 setup and when you die, you're gone. You either win by killing the other team, or you win by points - you get points from capture points and from kills, and loose points when team mates die. Every match has a limit of 20 minutes but often ends earlier. To be good at the game you mainly need situational awareness, and the ability to plan ahead, as well as accurately see what you opponents will do. It's also a fairly causual experience, there is 7v7 clan battle seasons, but the majority of your games will be ""random battles"" that just throw 12 people up against 12 other people with same classess and tiers of ships. You can group up with friends for these battles, but you are limited to groups of 3 people in each.You certainly can open up your wallet for this game, and you can be a whale too, but i dont think you need too. There are 10 tiers of ships and many ship trees that are all free. You first start with a very basic tier 1, get some experience with that then you get you buy (with in game currencies) the next tier ship in that line and so on. Every new tier introduces more game mechanics so the game gets harder the more you play, as higher tier ships only duke it out with other high tier ships. In the first tiers its +-1 tier, but when you reach tier 5 its +-2 tiers, meaning tiers 5s can be matched up against tier 7s. I see alot of reviews say this is a bad thing, but i dont really think so. Remember, every team has the exact same number of ships with the exact same classess and tiers. If you are a tier 5 destroyer there will be a tier 5 destroyer on the other team also. And a tier 5 ship can defiently outplay any tier 7 ship, you are just in a slightly worse ship. But I do think many players hit a wall at around tier 5 as alot of better players enjoy the mid tiers, and the lower tiers are full of noobs. That combined with more punishing game mechanics the higher you get up the trees could make your first tier 5 a rough experience. If you wanna progress quicker in the trees there is premium account time for sale, which could cost you 10 euros for a month, or less the more time you buy at once. (I just bought 12 months for 40 euros, but that was during a sale). There are also ships outside of the skill trees that are called premium ships, that you can only get from buying them directly. They have their benefits but are overall as good as the free ships, with a couple of exceptions (some premiums are hitting around 55% win rate on average). Over all I would not recommend buying any premiums when you start out, especially high tier ones. If you hop in a high tier ship as a noobie you get paired with others in high tier ships that knows the game and you will get absolutely smashed. So yeah, over all great game. Probably a bit different to what you are used to. It's mostly a mind game, your super quick counter strike reflexes and pin point accuracy wont really help you here.

Using a battleship at range can easily get you ban for many sessions as even if a ships sails in front of your shots it is always your fault. Ships sometimes sail along side you and you can easily shoot them if aiming down the scope which is the majority of the game. I've actedentally run into friendly torpedos yet the game counted it as his fault. I can only imagine how many games he was ban for.

It's a decent game to play around with, though highly annoying even for the full time streamers i see play the game. Biggest con in the game I would say is just how LUCK based it is. Now they will go on and on about their aiming system. But in reality it seems to be extremely luck based. I'll explain a bit. Most of the games i have played i seem to HALO about 90% of the time, while the other team seems to hit me with at least 5 shots of a 6 round burst at least 75% of the time. So the aiming works by creating an oval, the shots all land somewhere in the oval depending on LUCK. Now if you lock onto someone it is supposed to shrink this oval and if you're closer it also shrinks it. Funny thing is it never seems to matter. I have had shipps completely broad side to me and i hit on every ♥♥♥♥ing side but not 1 shot lands on the damn ship. I have had them nose at me and same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Of course shooting a ship coming straight at you should be harder, but when the enemy is attacking me like i said they seem to have about 75% accuracy regardless of the direction im going. Hell even when im playing a destroy class and continuously rotating around theyre hitting with most their shots.Now either 90% of the players are cheating and the creaters aren't doing a damn thing about it. Or their firing system is mostly luck based. However, if you can deal with that bs then you should be fine. I see many big streamers playing this game and they get irritated at how much they halo compaired to other ships too so I know it's not just me. It also seems to have severally increased how good AA is to the point that 1 bombing run of torps or bombers literally killed every one of the jets... And since carriers barely carry any ships (at least to teir 5) it's extremely pointless to even play as a carrier anymore. This can be noticed by how many games I play that are completely without carriers, and how when you are queing up the carrier que is typically at a 0... Kinda sad that you made a class completely pointless, when in real life carriers pretty much own everything. However, even with my negatives the overall fun I have had with this game out weighs the extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ portion to it.

You need to have some skill to participate in that engine, i.e. if you're not good you won't get the chance to get lucky or unlucky with shots at all and you'll simply miss, but even when you figure out ranging, leading, etc. you'll often find two shots from the same cannon drifting above AND below the target at the SAME TIME! Entire broadsides fired together will somehow fall inches from the target on every side without touching it. And sometimes every shot will hit. Totally up to the drift RNG. But even better, particular locations on the ship are critical hits (called the citadel) if you penetrate the armor. Taking the drift into account, you can aim for them, but outside close range it is, of course, relatively random whether you hit this spot or not. Whether you penetrate the armor or not is, you guessed it, more RNG. But what makes this REALLY great is on top of all that, if it DOES hit the citadel, and if it DOES penetrate the armor, the damage is utterly catastrophic, taking off up to 50% of your health per shell. Not a battleship shell to a destroyer. A battleship shell to a battleship. Same weight class. 50%. Gone. Just like that. Completely. At. Random.But what's even MORE fun? On top of all that, there is a tiny, tiny percentage chance that any given shot will hit your magazine. So more RNG for more massive damage.The practical upshot of all this is while there is a significant amount of skill involved, and the chances of it happening to you at any given time are low, you can (and do) intermittently just explode for no reason. You can be winning a duel by a LOT and then a lucky, single shell, fired as a parting shot from a fleeing foe with a broken rudder and a burning deck, will completely obliterate you.So to be completely fair, that doesn't happen much. But it does happen, and when it does it's pretty much the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ever. Basic citadel hits, which are far more common, are still pretty obnoxious, as there's little you can do about them.So basically, skill is involved, but not really the ultimate deciding factor. If you enjoy randomly exploding, play this game. If you don't... Well, if you're really into ships then give it a try for the good looking models and see for yourself. But if you're not into ships, just give it a pass. It's not a good enough game to reccomend to anybody who isn't a Pacific Theatre nerd.

When i downloaded it through steam it kept saying your game does not match the server version. I had to download the war games launcher from the game website, then link the launcher game folder to the steam game folder and splice the files. It took me a few days to figure that out. If i launch it through steam It brings me to a different profile not the wargames one. So that is why i only have .7 hours, although I do only have about 5 or 6 anyway. So far I would say it is fun, but my highest ship is tier 3, I'm like a thousand exp away from 4. I was pushing my way to a carrier but after seeing other reviews i am rethinking that decision. So far this is way less frustrating than world of tanks and warthunder. A lot less dying and it at least seems that the matches are mostly balanced. I hated when in world of tanks you would roll out then immediately get one shot by a premium tank three tiers higher than you with a bunch of premium buffs. I am sure I am going to hit a pay wall quite soon, but the game does seem nice enough where I am actually considering buying something. Probably when i hit the inevitable pay wall round tier 6. Over all I'd say give it a try. Just hide your wallet for a while because the options to buy are shoved in your fave and are quite tempting. It is quite fun in lower tiers so just play it till it pisses you off then uninstall, worked for world of tanks and all the games like this.",Tue Jan 19 07:40:03 EET 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

So thus leading you to play mostly in that lovley Co Op area until you can get a friend to play with or find one in game...but then again it's a free to play game so you'll find mostly children or the mental equivilent of a child when you need to have at least some tactical awareness in this VERY SLOW PACED game that heats up VERY QUICKLY only to end sometimes too fast or not fast enough...rarely do I ever find a truly Fun round.I can also just see the responses from those who defend this game religiously because they paid money for a ship and got ripped off thus they feel obligated to defend their 'investment' hahahahahahahIf anyone wants a quick idea of how much Real World money they want for a ship, the USS Arizona (BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST WELL REKNOWN SHIPS ON THE PLANET EARTH) is a tier 6 (maybe 7 I can't recall right now) and is a superior version to the it's counterpart that you can earn in game without needing real money. I first looked in to the price of it expecting maybe a $20 price tag perhaps pushing $30....OH NO! First you have to buy the in game currency which is only sold in certain bundles of ammounts and then you can spend that currency on the ship, also you don't get ANY REFUNDS once you buy this in game currency even if you don't use it. Well to wrap it up they wanted me to buy either a $60 bundle to have enough of the in game currency to just buy the USS Arizona however it would leave me with some extra that I have no use or desire for at all, I don't even want a spare crate or an extra ship slot at all just the ship....but no I have to over spend just to get what I want. Or I can spend around $45 on a few seperate bundles to get...yet again...just a few extra in game currency bits that I DON'T WANT. It's very kind of them to try and help you spend your money for you!Oh yeah don't forget that ALL of the purchaseable ships (Real World Money that is) are given so many extra buffs that a standard free to play player CAN NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO that don't only give some aid to the player who bought the ship as way of thanking them for the purchase (which I can understand) but they also give them in game advantages against you and your abilites making you a less lethal opponent...and they spent money to get that buff...I believe that's called PAY TO WIN. What a lame game this crap still is....it'll be dead in probably 1 year...2 if it's lucky hahahahahahh",Sat Jul 24 15:22:21 EEST 2021,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

They say is because of the game not being ""cross platform"" which is a lie, specially on PC when Steam can work as a launcher to launch the standalone game... So here is the thingThe game IS good, I do recommend it, however if you want to play with your old Wargaming account, here is what you need to do:1. Download the game2. Go to the directory it downloaded and delete steam_api.dll3. Open the game (if you had the standalone version, move the preferences.xml file to the directory so you get the login and config automatically)4. Log in and enjoy playing thru SteamHere is the thing, doing this WILL NOT allow you to pay with Steam currency, so you got to buy stuffs with direct purchases inside the game; if they release achievements YOU WILL NOT be able to get them (you can always use SAM to unlock those achievements, keep in mind, it's not fair nor ""legal"", do it at your own risk)So, why would you do this? You can do this to play your old account, while keeping the Steam overlay without any issue (adding the standalone version may cause some issues), have access to the community inside Steam, easier to have screenshots and share them, KEEP THE GAME UPDATED AUTOMATICALLYIf, in the future, they add Steam Trading cards, YOU WILL NOT, be able to get them, since this is a F2P game you need to spend money in their shop to get them...

However, it isn't as cheesy as the first Deus Ex, which is in my opinion kind of a downside, as that was also one of the greatest charms of the game.\nBut anyway, the story is really good, it also puts recent games bowing their heads to it, and yet again it is no match to the first Deus Ex. Still, the story is really damn good, with many twists, locations and loads of characters and backstory items to find in the game.\nAlso, that many things have actually consequences later on is very interesting, as it can change many things around, prompting to play through the game more than once.\nNow, onto the gameplay, I can say again that nothing will ever triumph over the original, but Human Revolution does a damn good job in modernising the gameplay in an actually good way. The covering system works kinda well, and as Human Revolution greatly promotes stealth gameplay, it is really fine on that front for avoiding the enemies. \nGoing with a textbook frontal assault works too, as you can have many vastly different weapons at your disposal, which are almost all upgradeable throughout the game.\nAlso, takedowns are really sastifying to do, althrough they can get a bit tedious after a while.\nAnother mostly rambled on point are the boss battles, how they are unavoidable and all, but really, you just gotta gear up  for that, much like bossfights in Metal Gear Solid.\nThrough I must admit that they aren't all that memorable as in Deus Ex 1999 and in MGS.\nAlso, this game is long, especially for this gaming generation.\nGreat music has always be a staple of the series, and Human Revolution is no stranger to that, as the music is worthy of the series.\nIn short, get this game already, it may not be the perfect follow-up to its legendary predecessor from 1999 (We don't mention Invisible War, that wasn't worthy of the name) , but it does one hell of a job introducing this generation to the series.""",Wed Aug 11 22:12:50 EEST 2021,9880c50d-ffda-4cad-8311-0ab8fc5844f6

I felt the ending did not tie up all of the game's loose ends, perhaps that's intentional, but if so, I think it neglects the most important part of those particular stories, to be honest. I also found the gameplay to be rather dull and even though, on several occasions, I was eager to see what the story lead to, it was undercut by the ten minutes of walking I had to do to progress it. Again, maybe that's the point, maybe it's to inspire you to meditate on what just happened, but I just found it boring as there was never enough story development to necessitate that, and muted my emotional investment by the time I actually got to where I was supposed to be. It's also rather expensive given how short it is, which also makes it difficult to recommend to anyone.

Ships from 20 years apart are forced to fight each other with enormous imbalances and a tier 5 will face tier 7s every other match.High tier gameplay is mostly boring campfests at long range because moving close gets someone instantly focused on the wide open maps.Aircraft carriers are both boring to play (like the world's worst RTS game) but also game-breakingly overpowered, with infinite fuel planes that launch 30 in 10 seconds (unlike a real carrier where it would take hours to get every single plane out of the hangar, moved up on deck and launched one at a time.) Because of the joke matchmaking, an aircraft carrier can fight a 1910 ship that does 0 DPS to airplanes because it got time-traveled by the terrible russian developer. Airplanes can drop torpedoes from solid cliff faces or 1 inch of water and there are no water-tight compartments on ships in-game, so a ship that could float without the nose and without the rear in real life will auto-die to 1 tiny section flooding with water after extinguishing a fire. Carriers average the damage of 3-4 combat ships but can stay hidden in spawn behind a cliff all game long with no risk.It's okay to play free, but do not expect the company to improve the game.

Having recently finished the first Deus Ex (DX), it would only be logical to delete my savegames in Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DX:HR) and completely start over: I can now compare the newest installment of the franchise to its original. Regardless, I am not going to burn DX:HR for all the things that it does different in comparison to DX. The gaming industry has changed and it would only be fair to keep things relative, just like how I did not hammer the graphics or some bugs in DX. \n\nThere are a couple of things that  form the essence of the Deus Ex franchise, and luckily most of these things are found back in DX:HR. To keep this review brief I will mainly focus on content, one of the things DX:HR excels in. The graphics are not awe inspiring as far as today's technology goes, but they are exactly what you need to immerse yourself in the setting DX:HR provides. There is a yellow/gold taint throughout the game that, although not positively received by everyone, makes the atmosphere consistent whereas the different designs of individual in-game locations make sure it does not feel repetitive. \n\nAudio-wise this game scores a lot of points. The used sound effects are decent to good, but what really stands out is the voice acting and music. Adam Jensen (voiced by Elias Toufexis) has thé sexiest voice I have heard in media for a while, but let's not forget about the others. A proper dosis of emotion make the characters sound convincing which makes it easier for the player to put themselves in their position, as unfortunate as that may be at times. To top it off, Michael McCann has provided an OST that does not only sound amazing, it also fits the atmosphere in a way that it's modern and just seems appropriate for the year 2027. \n\nAs far as the story is concerned, some players might find that it resembles DX too much, but they might be forgetting the fact that DX:HR is a prequel to the original DX. A lot of organizations and wrongdoings that concern the player in DX have their roots in DX:HR and therefore might make the story appear similar. However, an important difference is how Adam Jensen is operating from a corporate perspective in a world that is in the grasp of the power that large corporations have, this allows for some interesting problems to occur. Coupled with ethical dilemmas, the plot of DX:HR might be confusing for your average FPS gamer but will definitely intrigue those that are still reading at this point. \n\nThe gameplay is a clever mixture consisting of RPG elements, actual RPG gameplay (unlike many self-proclaimed RPGs - this is also mentioned in my DX review), basic shooter elements, and minigames that don't seem intrusive or out of place. So far it does not seem too different from DX, however, one point that bothers a lot of franchise fans is the fact that boss fights are in no way avoidable (edit: unless you have the director's cut!). This does not blend well with the fact that the AI can be pretty iffy at times. Regardless, this does not keep the player from experiencing, what I would call, a very worthy prequel of Deus Ex. \n\nI regard this game very highly, especially in today's market that seems mostly dominated by uninteresting games as far as shooters are concerned. My verdict is to buy this game, you must have tried it at least, there's a good chance you will embrace it and its franchise.""",Thu Mar 04 14:12:30 EET 2021,9880c50d-ffda-4cad-8311-0ab8fc5844f6

This is a good game if you like casually blowing stuff up while intoxicated, or you really like boats, or you found World of Tanks too fast-paced. But if you're expecting a polished product? No. Interface is extremely clunky, game mechanics are completely non-competitive, and controls do not work as intended.Controls feel really clunky compared to Navy Field, Stellar Impact, and Hyperbol. Turrets cannot be grouped or toggled and the controls are unresponsive. No matter how hard you try to master the controls, the keyboard has been nerfed to be on-par with the console controller. This plays like the PC port of a console game.And why is the scatter so bad? I've played cardgames with less RNG (randomness). I'd heard that the random accuracy and nerfed torpedoes and nerfed aircraft were bad, but making accuracy nonexistent at close ranges?? Real life shells can't have that much spread or they wouldn't make it through the artillery's barrel! If you don't want your shots careening off at random 30° tangents then... Good luck.Queueing up an ammo switch reloads ALL guns after ONE gun fires a shot, instead of queueing each reload individually. Turret rotation fights against the player and EVERY turret turns so slowly that any turret out of line of sight is actively working to sabotage the player's damage output. The mouse cursor rotates all turrets at once, shift-X rotates all turrets at once, P does not disable turret rotation, and there is no way to select turrets or group your turrets. The only way to disable your turrets is by aiming outside their turn radius, or by frustratedly trying to fire while turning, because quickly turning your ship and turrets in opposite directions will prevent them from firing! (Even if you hold down the mouse for sequential fire.) Remember not to ammo swap, because it puts ALL turrets on cooldown!Allied bots will actively torpedo you, and the vast majority of your teammates in PvP will be bots, because matchmaking is newwwbie-friendly ;) and to be extra redundant, if you want to tryhard and play aircraft carrier then you're not allowed to manually control your aircraft (at tiers 4 & 5) because god-forbid having RESPONSIVE CONTROLS THAT LET YOU OUTPLAY YOUR OPPONENT!Locking turret rotation, normalizing the projectile spread at short range, and debugging sequential fire & reloading - these would make the game somewhat immersive. But it feels like every single match is a fight against MY ship to try and get the same level of control that I had in EVERY OTHER SINGLE NAVAL GAME SINCE 2006! This is a CONSOLE game for CONSOLE controllers and if you play on keyboard - TOOOO bad!",Sat Aug 15 22:17:02 EEST 2020,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

I'll do it in Bullet form so it's Easier to find.COMBAT-Everyship has a Role to play. Carriers are there to Dominate the Air and Provide extra Means to sink/Spot Enemies. Battleships are the Tanks. Large HP and can deal massive amounts of Damage when your Main Battaries find their Mark. Cruisers provide Support Fire and help Defend the Larger Ships from Air Attacks. Destroyers are both Amazing and Annoying. Their Torpedoes can destroy a Ship in seconds, which both Benifits and Hurts you. If you see Torpedoes heading torwards you, either try to avoid them or pray they don't cause too much Damage. You have to Lead your Shots, failing to do so will result in a Wasted Shots. But combat seems Fair and has some Stratigy to it.So, now the Grind. Early on you'll notice that Ship's XP Requirement getls High, and I mean HIGH! Like a few days for one Ship kind of High. It wouldn't be so bad if they allowed Ship XP to be shared between Ships, basically negating Free XP (That can be shared but little is aquired). Also, you can't just start out with a Battleship, no you gotta work your way up, From Cruisers to Battleships, Battleships to Carriers. It is a bloosy Grind. My Suggestion? Go Player Versus Player, Yah you get some Coward Tactics but you get a lot more Bang for your Buck. Also, have 2-3 of the Same Ship. That way if you sink in Battle, you can still use another ship to get XP and since they are the same XP is stored on Each one for all use.Next... every Gamer's most HATED 2 Words... MICRO TRANSACTIONS!!!! Now, I hate EA with a Burning Passion.... but at least they don't charge you $60 for a f***ing Premium Ship! A Unique Tier 7 Battleship will cost around 12,000 Dubloons, which can cost you at least $60 just to buy a package. That is asinine. Add to the fact it NEVER is a High Tier 10 Ship, meaning it's the Best Ship for that Catagory/Nation. Since most ""Premium Ships"" are Tier 7-+, that means they aren't even the Strongest by Default. Yah, they maye have slightly different Stats, and have a ""Unique"" Paint Scheme, but NOT worth the $60",Sat May 15 01:38:24 EEST 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

Disregard any reviews that have less than 100 hours as they honestly haven't learned the game yet. It will take a lot of time to get the aiming in this game down, as every ships guns have different shell velocity or ""bullet speed"" and you will almost always have to lead your target. There is a lot of important information that the game doesn't tell you and this creates a learning curve that confuses and scares off a lot of people. You are almost certainly going to have to learn the mechanics via the wiki or online forums, but it is worth the time invested. There is a very long grind to get to a tier 10 ship (ships tiers range from 1-10 and the higher the tier the stronger the ship essentially) but it makes it that much more rewarding to get a t10. It took me around 100 hours to get my first t10 and it will take you more or less time depending on how quickly you learn the game and if your willing to shell out for premium.That brings us to the way the game is monetized. This game is free to play but has a subscription in the form of ""premium status"". All premium status does is give you a 50% boost to exp earned after each game as well as a credits earned boost. 50% is a huge boost yes, but you can most certainly play and progress without it. You also can get free premium status through events and the weekly operation. If you 5 star the weekly operation it will give you 24 hours of premium. So if you are free to play try and grind hard when you get that free day of premium every so often.There are also premium ships in this game that can be bought with real money. What most people don't mention though is that these are just slightly different versions of free-to-play ships that are better in some areas and worse in others. Also  premium ships only go up to tier 8. You can not directly buy any ship above tier 8 and you can't progress to higher tiers by playing them. This basically means that at the highest levels of play (tier 10) you arent going to see any premium ships. And if you do see them then they are at a huge disadvantage, as they are gonna be 2 tiers under you.I very much suggest atleast trying this game if you are interested.

However, it isn't as cheesy as the first Deus Ex, which is in my opinion kind of a downside, as that was also one of the greatest charms of the game.\nBut anyway, the story is really good, it also puts recent games bowing their heads to it, and yet again it is no match to the first Deus Ex. Still, the story is really damn good, with many twists, locations and loads of characters and backstory items to find in the game.\nAlso, that many things have actually consequences later on is very interesting, as it can change many things around, prompting to play through the game more than once.\nNow, onto the gameplay, I can say again that nothing will ever triumph over the original, but Human Revolution does a damn good job in modernising the gameplay in an actually good way. The covering system works kinda well, and as Human Revolution greatly promotes stealth gameplay, it is really fine on that front for avoiding the enemies. \nGoing with a textbook frontal assault works too, as you can have many vastly different weapons at your disposal, which are almost all upgradeable throughout the game.\nAlso, takedowns are really sastifying to do, althrough they can get a bit tedious after a while.\nAnother mostly rambled on point are the boss battles, how they are unavoidable and all, but really, you just gotta gear up  for that, much like bossfights in Metal Gear Solid.\nThrough I must admit that they aren't all that memorable as in Deus Ex 1999 and in MGS.\nAlso, this game is long, especially for this gaming generation.\nGreat music has always be a staple of the series, and Human Revolution is no stranger to that, as the music is worthy of the series.\nIn short, get this game already, it may not be the perfect follow-up to its legendary predecessor from 1999 (We don't mention Invisible War, that wasn't worthy of the name) , but it does one hell of a job introducing this generation to the series.""",Sat May 29 19:48:20 EEST 2021,9880c50d-ffda-4cad-8311-0ab8fc5844f6

In its current state, it needs way too much work to be worth your time and money. I've been playing the game since the closed beta, and have well over 2500 battles since the closed beta reset. [EDIT] [I'm coming back to this review to address developer responses and update based on the current state of the game. I plan to do this every 3-6 months. An edit will appear in brackets. as of February 2018, many of my original points still stand, but I wanted to address the developer comments as well because the developers argue against my review.]Let’s start with the good:+Arcade battles allow for quick play, and make it constant action+The gameplay itself is rather fun, and the progression through the lines gives you a sense of accomplishment and goals+When a battle is well-balanced vertically and horizontally, the results make for a fun and engaging battle where while every team member counts, you can sway the battle in your favor by good play.        +[The developers, after learning the hard way multiple times, are starting to engage with the community in a positive manner, instead of constantly arguing every point (if you are confused, see the response below.]However, these positives are overshadowed by the glaring flaws in the game:-Poor client optimization: I have a rather good computer, and the game constantly hangs and eats up an inordinate amount of power for comparatively mediocre graphics [2/18 The developers can of course disagree, but that doesn't make them right. I have an extremely good processor and a top-of-the-line graphics card. This computer can run VR without flinching. This computer can run ARK at 50-60 fps at 4K and max graphics. This game runs WoWs competitor WarThunder without a hitch. Warframe runs extremely well at 4K (with its plethora of particle effects and much more going on screen) and looks beautiful. Meanwhile, this game constantly hitches and completely lags out while in a menu or when you try to switch out a component on your ship. While the actual gameplay doesn't lag too much, the menu is unbearable, and you feel as though I'm dragging the game to play it in the menus. Something needs to give, whether it is a full engine upgrade, or a simple optimization of code (maybe not having to do a server call every time one presses a button in port)]-Steam is for new users only (while this is a minor complaint, it’s a giant middle finger to those who’ve played since closed beta and gets me to my last point) [2/18 While the developers have voiced their opinion and are not going to revisit it, it still is a flaw in the game. And yes, adding features and flags that are only for new players through steam that older, dedicated players cannot get is insulting to those players, and shows the value the developers place on older players.]-Ridiculous Price model puts “premium ships” around $25-$30 USD for a handful of pixels (and that is on the lower end) [2/18 Once again, though the developers ""have stated it many times before"", newer players should know that the premium ships are generally expensive. If the developers do not want to lower the price, that is their perrogative, but it might be a barrier to entry]-Premium accounts are about the only way to make your investment back at the highest tiers unless you have consistently great games (which you won’t) [2/18 Without a premium account, you can easily lose 100k-200k credits if you have a not-so-great game in a tier X ship, which discourages you from bringing them out and having fun in hitting the capstone in a ship line.]-And why yes, premium ships are overpowered, making the game unbalanced[2/18 Balancing a game is difficult, yes. And while I do admire the developers for not nerfing ships people paid money for, it does create problems. Recently, some ships like the Belfast were offered a refund because of a significant mechanic change. However, it does make things like ranked play difficult if there is an overpowered ship in the tier, because you can count on it being in your match. To be fair, the community does a lot of screeching if a preview of a premium is underpowered, but that is actually a better situation to introduce them underpowered rather than have an OP ship be untouchable.]Which brings me to the ugly:-The aircraft carriers (CVs) are completely out of whack, ruin the rock-paper-scissors balancing, and that one ship can ruin the entire match (There is a reason why carriers revolutionized naval warfare, and the game promotes a pre-carrier battle with aircraft carriers). If you CV captain forgot his brain at home, you will likely get blown up by the enemy CV, as there is little you can do to defend against enemy planes. [2/18 Grouping will likely not save you, unless you are in a clan match with a highly coordinated team. All you are left to do is either pray that there is no CV, or throw a bunch of AA on your ship, thereby gimping it and making it a problem. The AA spec everything is also not fun for the CV, as he just has to sit there and do almost nothing all game. Being a total wash should not depend on the grace of the matchmaker, but rather the skill of the team.]-Horizontal imbalance: ships from the same tier, but different nations are astoundingly out of whack.  [2/18 Once again, balancing is hard, but constantly throwing new mechanics in new ship/national lines makes your job more difficult.]-The power creep is real, and recently released ships pound their predecessors into the water. [2/18 Considering that a certain RN tier X BB nerf is in the works, the developers might be getting a bit more sensitive to this.]-Vertical imbalance: You will get overmatched in a battle, up to two tiers. A tier V battleship cannot take a tier VII battleship on a tier VII map. You end up either slow and irrelevant or blown to bits in one of the faster ships. [2/18 While Steam provided a slight increase in player base, it did not provide enough to alleviate the problem in middle tiers. Those players likely quit out of frustration, and might be lost to the void, leaving WoWs right at square one.]-Developer attitudes to player base are adversarial: they bully critical streamers into avoiding negative reviews, and are only remorseful when they are caught and the community backlash forces them to apologize. I’ve seen more customer cooperation from my internet provider and most US airlines. [2/18 This is a bit on the mend. Wargaming has avoided sticking their foot in it since November (an improvement in and of itself.) The developers and community outreach has been much more active on Reddit and their forums with Sub_Octavian. Further, Wargaming seems to have become more receptive to player feedback and are working on improvements. However, based on the developer responses (from November, so they might have improved) some old habits die hard, and instead of saying ""We're sorry you had problems, and thank you for giving us suggestions."" or ""While we know we have problems in our game, we are working to correct them."" we have a point-by-point argument or simple contradiction rather than an attempt at reconciliation. This is indicative of the attitude that can kill so many great games.]While I really enjoy this game, I can’t support it in its current form with its current development team. At such a high cost for its premium content, the flaws should have been fixed a year ago. It has a great base mechanic, but not having the support it deserves drives players like me away. I hope to someday give it a good review, but that is not today.[2/18 Unfortunately, there hasn't been enough improvement to the game for me to recommend it. Where there has been improvement, it has not been remarkable enough to change my attitude towards WoWs. I want to give this game a positive review, because there is so much potential, but  it is so frustrating to watch it get squandered.",Sun Sep 20 20:17:26 EEST 2020,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

Having recently finished the first Deus Ex (DX), it would only be logical to delete my savegames in Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DX:HR) and completely start over: I can now compare the newest installment of the franchise to its original. Regardless, I am not going to burn DX:HR for all the things that it does different in comparison to DX. The gaming industry has changed and it would only be fair to keep things relative, just like how I did not hammer the graphics or some bugs in DX. \n\nThere are a couple of things that  form the essence of the Deus Ex franchise, and luckily most of these things are found back in DX:HR. To keep this review brief I will mainly focus on content, one of the things DX:HR excels in. The graphics are not awe inspiring as far as today's technology goes, but they are exactly what you need to immerse yourself in the setting DX:HR provides. There is a yellow/gold taint throughout the game that, although not positively received by everyone, makes the atmosphere consistent whereas the different designs of individual in-game locations make sure it does not feel repetitive. \n\nAudio-wise this game scores a lot of points. The used sound effects are decent to good, but what really stands out is the voice acting and music. Adam Jensen (voiced by Elias Toufexis) has thé sexiest voice I have heard in media for a while, but let's not forget about the others. A proper dosis of emotion make the characters sound convincing which makes it easier for the player to put themselves in their position, as unfortunate as that may be at times. To top it off, Michael McCann has provided an OST that does not only sound amazing, it also fits the atmosphere in a way that it's modern and just seems appropriate for the year 2027. \n\nAs far as the story is concerned, some players might find that it resembles DX too much, but they might be forgetting the fact that DX:HR is a prequel to the original DX. A lot of organizations and wrongdoings that concern the player in DX have their roots in DX:HR and therefore might make the story appear similar. However, an important difference is how Adam Jensen is operating from a corporate perspective in a world that is in the grasp of the power that large corporations have, this allows for some interesting problems to occur. Coupled with ethical dilemmas, the plot of DX:HR might be confusing for your average FPS gamer but will definitely intrigue those that are still reading at this point. \n\nThe gameplay is a clever mixture consisting of RPG elements, actual RPG gameplay (unlike many self-proclaimed RPGs - this is also mentioned in my DX review), basic shooter elements, and minigames that don't seem intrusive or out of place. So far it does not seem too different from DX, however, one point that bothers a lot of franchise fans is the fact that boss fights are in no way avoidable (edit: unless you have the director's cut!). This does not blend well with the fact that the AI can be pretty iffy at times. Regardless, this does not keep the player from experiencing, what I would call, a very worthy prequel of Deus Ex. \n\nI regard this game very highly, especially in today's market that seems mostly dominated by uninteresting games as far as shooters are concerned. My verdict is to buy this game, you must have tried it at least, there's a good chance you will embrace it and its franchise.""",Wed Apr 07 06:13:17 EEST 2021,9880c50d-ffda-4cad-8311-0ab8fc5844f6

STO Does have a gambling system called the lockbox (pay $1.25 for 1 key, and drop chances are usually 1/500) which needs to be fixed and balanced, but is otherwise pretty good. In all the game does have a nice story arc, but needs more max level activities, due to the lack of things available to max level characters. I will be making some guides in the future for this game if anyone needs to learn some things such as how Inertia, or momentum affects starships and etc. I PERSONALLY rate this game 10/10! but beware pay to wins and pay to players, they will GREATLY have a massive advantage over you.Most star ships I will say, are pay to play, but it is ENITRELEY possible and quite easy to get one Especially during the anniversary event (via omega particles) buy buying your wanted ship from the exchange.

This is the only game I've come back to. I understand some people complain about grinding, or about purchasing things etc. However, there are two things which make this formula acceptable, and here is why: the Devs continually modify and add to the game - they can't be expected to work for free. Secondly, in no way do you feel like you need to buy stuff with real money. If truth be told, most of what you might buy would either be some specific ships or extra docks (and of course, the EC cap). Sure, you can buy whatever else you'd like if you really want to, but you don't really need to. Considering that Zen is the currency which can be bought with real money, it should be noted that dilithium (an ingame only currency) can be obtained and then traded for Zen.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: PROS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Spock... is in the game. Leonard Nimoy's voice lives on in the game, alongside many, many other characters.Game mechanics are really good, and I consider them to be the norm on which any space game should be created upon.You can customize your characters with a fairly decent amount of costumes.An incredibly huge assortment of ships, and always growing.The Borg... as powerful as advertised in the shows and movies.Content has been either changed or removed/added in the past to improve the storyline.Every faction (Fed/Klingon/Rom) have a specific storyline until it merges.Each faction has a huge assortment of ships to select.Crafting system is extremely simple, and unique items can be obtained in such a way.Select whatever type of weapon types: phaser, disruptor, polaron, tetryon, anti-proton, plasma and other.Good voice acting.Global official giveaways - ships and items - and special events.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CONS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::The Borg... they drain your shields like it was nothing, and you can't do a thing about it - but that's also a Pro.Not as much content as I'd like.You do have to grind quite a bit, depending on what you want to achieve.The reputation system doesn't unlock every tier for every character once unlocked (this process is tedious), and takes 20 days at the very least, and 40 days initially (20 days once you obtain Sponsorship Tokens).Not enough costumes, hairstyles or beardstyles.Some specific characters cannot be modified, costume wise.Some races are not playable (yet), such as Cardassians, Breen, Vortas/Jem'Hadar, although you can usually create the look of most of them. Takes a while, of course.Personally, I have experienced frequent disconnects at some point (not always, but maybe once a month).Graphics are a bit dated, despite some improvements. Since game plays very well, and most players only care about space battles, it doesn't matter as much. ",Fri Sep 25 22:53:17 EEST 2020,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

Game contains ""premium"" ships and ""premium"" weapons, which are well balanced. Thing is, this game is very hard to master.To make it clear, I killed many battle cruisers and other battle ships with scientific ships. How?You need to have these skills.1) Combat strategy. You cant just fly straight to enemy and kill him, you have to find weakness, like slow turning speed, or slow weapon recharge and use it for yourself. There are many ways how to kill other player with ""premium ship"" because his ship cant turn so fast as yours, so you keep being away from his weapons firing range and still shoot at him.2) Buy/Sell strategy. You have to buy and sell weapons and other stuff. You have scientific vessel, its having great shields. Now you need weapons. You cant buy just any, you have to be sure they can fire effectively and you can shoot everywhere. Boost your shields or new weapon? There are many decisions about fitting your ship and buying new stuff. Premium weapons can make you ""OP"". But same can do weapons from market for ingame money.3) RPG skills for ground fight.

Head out and start star treking.Depends though however how you like to trek. Lets make one thing clear you dont play this game to explore. If you want to do that play bridge crew. This game is heavily focused on a kill or be killed Star Trek adventure. With many different weapons, both ground and space, and ships, one can not simply have enough. Is this game pay to win?Honestly not in the way you think. First off dont play PVP, as someone who has bought ships even I hate PVP, some people have death dreadnaught able to slam you while you barely dent them. However, PVE allows any ship from free to premium. Premium currency exists as well as loot boxes, no surprise as it is free to play. However, you dont actually need to buy any. Every Summer and every Winter there is an event that everyone can play and by doing a short mission everyday for a couple days you are given a free ship which is on level with the new one released all the time (T6 ship). Those ships however, are not as iconic as the ones you would get with premium currency. Now you can grind the premium currency but it will take you a very very long time. In that case it is pay for convenience. The loot box system is unintrusive, unless you are a ship collector with some ships going for exuberant prices. All in all I like this game. I feel that if it keeps up with its numbers it could last a while and with the introduction of another faction right around the corner, who knows how long we will be able to cruise the galaxy together.",Wed Mar 17 00:02:48 EET 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

You even chose the different officers on your ship which then opens up different abilities which you can choose from.You get duty officers alos which you can send on mission and this can level you, get skill points and dilithium.I havent finished learning the game, there seems like there is much more and they are always improving it and adding new seasons.",Mon Nov 29 10:51:15 EET 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

Long before I had Steam, back when it was vastly different than what I have seen now.Finding myself getting back to this gem was a nice refreshing taste of nostalgia - and a bit of dissapointment. Some of what I saw as the more fun and Trek-like gameplay is gone. Random missions is replaced with sporatic patrols that shift daily that you need to find. But despite the loss, there is so much more added I can really start to appreciate this game, and willing to admit I'm a lifer now. I've come back to this game time and time again - and it does hold an aspect that I see worth visiting.Many of the old, glitchy, unwanted parts (and I bet many of the negative reviews here are based on those) are long since gone. New elements have been added to help encourage a wider and more varried feel to the game. Many aspects have been added or changed to encourage development of really impressive improvements. R&D got an overhaul with the Duty Officers you gain, making it easier to earn good stuff - and add the possibility of making your own unique and impressive equipment. Bridge Officers have the ability to learn multiple skills, so you can have just a few favorites for the ideal team mix but still have the ability to shift what powers they use to simplify things in certain situations. Player Traits have been vastly overhauled. Parts of it I regret missing, you can't have an overpowered selection of a dozen or more Reputation traits powering you up - but you can now shift between selections in certain areas not in combat zones. And the mixing is balanced out well so far.You can make your captain and crew into what you dream here, in many surprising ways.But comes the only glaring problem I see - its an MMO. Its a kill or be killed area where damage is king. Grinding is a must and you gotta mow down mobs en masse. RP'ers will find some loss in certain builds and styles just not up to par - and if you want the top gear, you'll need to grind. And some grinds can't be done without a certain level of killing strength, so some things - just can't cut it. Doesn't feel very Trek at times. But I can't really call that a truly negative part at the moment.STO is Trek, just not the TV or Movie Trek. Its another Trek, in another galaxy. Another mirrored universe almost where you need to adapt to new enemies and threats. And face a hard truth. Kill or be killed.Outside of that, the game itself is showing an unbelieveable ammount of improvements over time. Focusing more on gameplay mechanics to help make enjoying the game easier. You just need to learn that over time.The Trek part? Well, its there. Cameoes, nods, and a great deal of effort in stories. But some of the later aspects really don't fit like I wish they did. But this isn't really the same Trek I would want it to be. Its not bad, just different. Can't honestly fault that anymore.Its a good MMO, with good merits and definetly something I could reccomend as you could find what you want in here somewhere - it certainly does have its size to go for it. That and the Foundry. Player-created content is a huge aspect of the game and if you got the time, you'll find a whole slew of additions to content and story that makes this game well worth the visit. The hard part is just finding it.But that's a bit of the charm. There is so much here, so much possibility. There is good, and bad - but overall, its trying a respectable rate to be better. I gotta admit that's worth it itself.Now the somewhat dated graphics and cartain core elements - well, that's just cause its an older game. But don't let that dissuade you here. You'll find something worth visiting, and even more worth coming back for. I know I have.",Sat May 23 08:36:30 EEST 2020,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

The map system in this game is complete garbage, and even though I am a survivor main with 75% of my hours across all platforms being that of a survivor, most of the maps in this game are ruthless for killers. I wouldn't say this game is survivor sided, as realistically a \""scummy\"" killer can hold all the power in a game by simply going against the \""survivor rulebook for killers\"", but it is still brutal. Multiple videos providing evidence for this can be found online, including videos from Demi, Tru3Talent, etc. From broken loops to sweat squads with locker flashlighting on dead dawg saloon, the potential to destroy a killer's motivation to play this game is definitely there.\nSecondly, after 1000 hours in this game, you would expect to be able to have all perks for all characters on at least half of the cast for one of the sides. I am sure if you were ridiculously efficient with how you spend your bloodpoints form the VERY beginning of the game, then it just might be barely possible. Tier systems for perks in this game are outdated and needs to be completely removed for both sides. This would avoid needed thousands of hours to be able to play any killer however you want, and play any survivor how you want as well. I'm aware changing survivors doesn't really matter too much, but for killers this is a really big deal.\nLastly, mmr is complete trash. The \""ranking\"" system in dbd has never been accurate and probably never will be. Ironically the current \""grade\"" system is better at ranking than the mmr \""ranking\"" system. I'm aware in a game like this it is hard to create a sustainable ranking system, but just slapping a bad system onto it and calling it a day is not a solution.\nEvery new patch in dbd seems to make the game slightly more unplayable for both sides, but mostly for killers. Everyone runs the same 4 perks out of a pool of 6 or 7 on both sides, and it's ridiculous how little variety there is in this game. Half of the excellent perks are locked behind paywalls (which whilst not an issue for myself personally, is a giant issue for a 5 year old game). \nThis is no longer a game that I have an infinite amount of passion for like I used to. I have played this game (on console) from just after it's launch, but repeatedly came back as I found the concept to be original and enticing. Back in late 2018 I switched to the PC version, stopped playing yet again but in 2019 was drawn back into it again. This was probably the peak of dbd for myself and a lot of others, as whilst it was unbalanced it was nowhere near as hellish as it currently is. I met some lifelong friends through this game so will always be grateful to it, and it will always hold a special place to me as far as a game can.\nIf you are thinking of getting this game, be prepared to sink thousands of hours into it before being able to play at an optimal level. I wish you luck, and hope you grow to love this game as much as I did.""",Sun Sep 06 13:19:00 EEST 2020,16c54f00-1cb1-4c8d-9cc7-38895a645882

Star Trek Online allows one to fulfill all of their dreams of having a role in Star Trek. You have the option of three (four if you count the semi TOS version of the Feds) options for your character, Federation, Romulans, and the Klingons. Many actors from the series have come on as voice actors to portray their characters. The game also allows you to progress from and Ensign to a Fleet Admiral (Using Federation ranks). As for the gameplay itself, you have a ship on ship combat and away team combat. The ship combat can be as complicated as you want it, you could spam fire all weapons, or set up loadouts and your crews abilities and tailor your actions to each combat scenario. The ground combat is from a third person perspective and is more of a point and click type of conflict than anything else. So far, I have not had an issue with repetitively because of foundry missions. These are missions created by other players, and some are very good. The missions that are produced by the developers are usually good. However, there may be a few bad ones that you may want to take advantage of the ""skip"" button.

Steam says 1900 hours, but i bet its like 2200 already without the Steam Client. i played it from the beginning, not constantly , but now and then with friends. Is it old and feels a bit clunky? Yes. Could it use an overhaul? Yes. Is it good? Hell yes! Even with its outdated graphics and technology, this game is still somewhat addictive and fun, especially when you play it with friends. It is a free to play model, that is true. But most content (also endgame related content) is free and you can gain it via missions and work. The so called ""grind"" is something that you can do on a stand-by, since its literally getting some simple ressources (5 - 10 min work) and then clicking on ""earn reputation"" , and wait 20 hours to complete the task. That is literally all you have to do for ""endgame content"". No hours and hours of hard work with repetetive fighting and gathering. While the graphics isnt something everyone likes, this game gives you a very good executed story with hours of voice-overs, interesting missions and complete customization. You want your crew to wear a special uniform? Go for it! You want to customize your own skills, your crew skills and the weaponry of your character, your crew (away team) AND your ship? Go for it! You dont like Starfleet? You would rather play a deceptive Romulan with their cool ships, or a warmonger Klingon with a massive dreadnought? Go for it! This game has massive customization options, hundrets of ships, and an interesting take on ""Quests"". You hate being send to get some random drops like wolf-fangs or bear-claws with your task being slaughtering hundrets of monsters to finally get the drops to your npc? Well, Star Trek Online has NONE of such quests. Every single mission is literally a story, with you and your crew flying through the galaxy to distant planets and fighting huge battleships with torpedos, phasers and disruptors, but also holstering your guns and rifles and beaming down to get into dangerous close quarter combat in an enemy base to rescue hostages or find artefacts. True, they could have done the controls a bit better, but if you are able to literally adjust your controls and keymapping  to your liking, you will have alot of fun. I only say: ""Switch to shooter mode!"" , and turn your mmo in a third person shooter. If you are a Star Trek Nerd, you even can write your own log files. Oh, you have done all the story missions, and raids and fleet actions are nothing for you? How about you play one of the ten-thousands of missions of the foundry? Its a pool of community created missions that are mostly checked by the developers and being rated by players. Even there you have voice over. There is literally ""endless ingame content"" if you are searching for missions and quests en mass. And if you are a munchkin who likes to jingle a bit with numbers and calculations about the best gear, visit the Star Trek Online wiki and loose your mind about how much you can learn and do here. XDDont let yourself get tricked by ""only"" 3 classes... engineer, tactical or science. The class choice is literally only for selecting your base-abilities of ""you wanna do damage"" , ""you wanna heal or control"" or ""you wanna have a mixture of both"" . You can be a tactical player with grenades, supressing fire and damage buffs, while also flying a science ship or a cruiser. You are not bound by class, and you can literally choose your skills freely. All in all, i can promise that the game offers many options and gameplay mechanics that may be unusual for an mmo, but if you can overlook its age and the sometimes little technical problems, you will find a gem that can literally brighten up your day. Do some ships or species cost money? Yes, but honestly, this game has potential to entertain you far more than any actuall tripple A title with their usual 20 hours of storyplay, so you can honor the developers hard work with a few bucks to spend on this game. If i am generous with my calculation and even say a tripple A title would have 30 hours of entertainment in storyline, i would have had to buy 66 games to entertain me that long like Star Trek Online did. So yeah, have my 20 bucks for a nice endgame ship and let me play some more. ^^",Tue May 21 00:51:25 EEST 2019,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

The character models are better than many games I've played and there's a decent amount of customization. I like playing really true-to-show experiences, but the ""make your own alien"" option was amazingly fun. Whether you want to make a race one could TOTALLY believe was in a Trek world somewhere, or create a hideous (or hilarious) abomination, the system is great fun. Worth fiddling with even if you won't play one, just to see what you can do with it.Seriously, the moment I stepped into the story and started flying my own ship around, I was living out my Trekkie fantasies of my own show with a captain just how I wanted her. I played a Trill after the nature of my favorite character ever (Jadzia Dax of course!) and the tutorial was barely over before I started reading the dialogue out loud and giving orders verbally, including whatever Trek-no-babble I could manage, just for the fun of it. Yes, I'm a giant geek, but I totally recommend you let yourself give into the urge to just ENJOY this game for what it does well: a wonderful story full of content that well and truly makes you feel like whatever character you chose to be.Play it for the story. Your own Star Trek story. Play this as a delightfully free story-driven action/adventure title and you will not be disappointed.Not-recommended if: You want to play it for other reasons than the story.

However, it isn't as cheesy as the first Deus Ex, which is in my opinion kind of a downside, as that was also one of the greatest charms of the game.\nBut anyway, the story is really good, it also puts recent games bowing their heads to it, and yet again it is no match to the first Deus Ex. Still, the story is really damn good, with many twists, locations and loads of characters and backstory items to find in the game.\nAlso, that many things have actually consequences later on is very interesting, as it can change many things around, prompting to play through the game more than once.\nNow, onto the gameplay, I can say again that nothing will ever triumph over the original, but Human Revolution does a damn good job in modernising the gameplay in an actually good way. The covering system works kinda well, and as Human Revolution greatly promotes stealth gameplay, it is really fine on that front for avoiding the enemies. \nGoing with a textbook frontal assault works too, as you can have many vastly different weapons at your disposal, which are almost all upgradeable throughout the game.\nAlso, takedowns are really sastifying to do, althrough they can get a bit tedious after a while.\nAnother mostly rambled on point are the boss battles, how they are unavoidable and all, but really, you just gotta gear up  for that, much like bossfights in Metal Gear Solid.\nThrough I must admit that they aren't all that memorable as in Deus Ex 1999 and in MGS.\nAlso, this game is long, especially for this gaming generation.\nGreat music has always be a staple of the series, and Human Revolution is no stranger to that, as the music is worthy of the series.\nIn short, get this game already, it may not be the perfect follow-up to its legendary predecessor from 1999 (We don't mention Invisible War, that wasn't worthy of the name) , but it does one hell of a job introducing this generation to the series.""",Tue Apr 13 22:52:28 EEST 2021,9880c50d-ffda-4cad-8311-0ab8fc5844f6

Star Trek Online has come a long way from the 49.99 shelf price I picked it up at. From beaming down to that alien world of your favorite Star Trek episode, to fighting the Borg across the sector. Each piece culminates into a game anyone who enjoys Sci-fi can love. Trekkies of course get the opportunity to visit each of those scenes they loved most in Star Trek.The current iteration of Star Trek Online is quite simply put, 'Marvelous' and only getting better with the addition of the Delta Quadrant. PVE is the main focus, but PVP is possible in specified battle zones. Surprisingly, and a wonderful touch in my opinion—has been the growing addition of Voice Actors for a number of main quests, and most importantly, voice acting by actual Star Trek actors, come to replay their digital roles. Some of STO’s original voice acting flops, but they have gotten very good at putting the proper emotion behind their voice actor’s character. Each new addition is far better than the last. More than anything else, in this game…the story is perhaps the cherry on top. Wrapping the player into a universe that is similar, and yet so very different from the shows we used to watch. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction of any kind, just wants to kill things in space ships, or loves a good story.

New ship teir upgrades seem to be just a way to get more money from people for getting them to pay for upgrading their ships to the new level cap... overall would say game is going down hill in terms of enjoyablity, but still there is a lot of content and story you can play for free... but you can and do play it all solo... so i guess the big question is, why is this called an MMO, other than chat and a great friendly community, there really isn't a lot (or any) multiplayer gaming involved...Love this game. Stays true to Star Trek style without getting to MMO gimmicky. For a long long time (years and years) there was no level cap increase, which I liked. It made it not about levels, there was just new expansion packs, missions, story and new epic ships, gear, and classes. Made it more about the gameplay and less about grinding.Pros: Giant emersive star trek universeRidiculous amout of missions and contentRPG style for both your main character, you bridge officers and your ship adds a nice changeSpace combat is awersome. dynamic fights and strategy plays a large part in success not just better gear. yet still simple enough and not to complicated like Wing Commander where on top of everything else you need to learn to fly. Cons:PVP is very limiting. there are two factions at war, but PVP feels like a trapped collaseum of bashing each other till another ship explodes, pvp matches are also limited to how many people can fight. Compared to other MMO RPGs with PVP where you are running around with 30 or 40 other people it feels less MM and more like a group of friends came over for board game night. Ground combat: ground missions add a great change to space missions for sure, and the unique skills, puzzles, and enemies types keeps things interesting. and while I have seen some people group for ground 'raids' to get crystals and gear, the game makes it less enjoyable to actually participate in ground combat and has no insentive for ground PVP so no one really does it.Crafting: crafting has changed a lot over the years in this game. the first version was cool cause it was very 'Star Trek' like with various types of crafting each with sub crafting types, very star trek specialization. I liked this for this reason, made me feel more apart of the star trek universe. However, and understandable so, it made being able to craft everything incredible difficult (if thats what you want, its not for me, but I know lots of MMO gamers who do) and required 100's of specific and different crafting materials. So they changed it. simplifed a bunch of it, and reduced mats, and got rid of the sub specities.... then I took a year off the game and came back,... and it was changed again... even more simplfied but also now completly useless. None of the craftable gear was anything you would ever want to use. The had changed the way the 'fleet' bases worked and all the gear that was worth 'crafting/buying' was now sold at your fleets starbase. (the rest of the gear worth getting became reputation gear from the borg/omega/romulan expansions).Last con: this game has changed owners so many times and each time different people try to do different things with it and it has changed the way the game is played.  Perpetual Entertainment started working on it for the first 4 years, i signed up with them to be notifed when the game was ready and for beta testing, When Cryptic Studios took over development after Perpetual went bankrupt and started their codebase from scratch, I was never informed and the list I signed up for on the website was never transfered over and it was kinda ridiculous when I found out I had to sign up again. Atari did a really good job of adding new missions to the game but when they no longer wanted to be in the MMO ring they sold the game (and other MMOs) to Perfect World Entertainment, who already owned a vast array of MMO games. Although PWE has done some really good things for STO (the last two expansions were great), they changed the in game currancy and micro cash transaction system to match their exisiting games that clearly make them money, and they baught STO to make them money so it makes sense but it also made STO less like a star trek MMO in a star trek universe and more like a very 'gamey' environment, where everything was setup to game you into buying things. Which completly changed the dynamic and how the game was played in a not so positive way (if you were enjoying the star trek universe anyway). Its still a great game, just feels more like a futuristic sci-fi game now and less like you are in the star trek universie. I list this as a con because who knows who will own it next or what they will do with it.",Sun Jun 20 15:30:27 EEST 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

It has an incredibly versatile battle system for fighting in space and on the ground.

They've added all kinds of new types of missions: diplomatic, space missions, research missions, ground missions of all sorts, away team missions and lots of sweet new gear to boot. The characters themselves look the best they've ever looked; when I first began playing I was very disappointed in the way they looked, they were all sort of the same looking. Now, the characters have tight gear and outfits that are totally unique (assuming you have some epic stuff to equip and in some cases, even if you don't!).                               As you continue to level up, you just look cooler and cooler. The ships are sick as well and since you can choose 3 separate factions (Klingon, Romulan, Fedreration) then you have a choice of some sweet Romulan ships (which are all epic thanks to their singularity warp drive ftw) or if you want a cool Klingon Bird-of-Prey or a classic (or newer!) Federation ship (also, any race can play any faction). The weapons have become more and more epic over the years just like everything else in STO. 100% Worth a shot, if you've been uncertain about whether or not to go for it, now would be the time.

With a high production value, quite remarkable music score and high quality dialogue for what little dialogue there is the game feels quite polished to date. For the Starship junkie such as myself, the ships look detailed and true to canon. The main quest is gripping and enjoyable, it makes levelling a breeze with a good balance of investment and reward as your character levels.In contrast to other free-to-play MMO’s, the micro-transactions in this game are kept to a minimum; most purchases made from the Cash shop are entirely cosmetic, which have little to no impact on game-play, and are not necessary in the progression of your character. In addition to that, the in-game currency Dilithium can be converted to large sums of cash shop credit, offering economical alternatives for those that don’t wish to outlay any cash, but spend vast amounts of time playing.Space combat is one of its strengths, you will have direct control over your ship and its stations with everything laid-out in front of you. Basic Starship operation and commands are very intuitive with control tight and concise. Yet, ground combat is another story. On the ground, your skills are vastly different from that in space, how effective your combat will be will be dependent on the your chosen away team, with the focus on movement, your equipment and environmental hazards, as well as the groups of varying enemies. Coupled with the rather basic RPG style of button mashing to complete your attach, ground missions will wear out their welcome sooner rather than later.Space exploration itself is somewhat of a disappointment, for an open-world title, the experience you’ll have amongst the different sectors and its planets are at best, predictable and simple. Most missions comprise of destroying ships or scanning structures. While the strong story arc helps break the monotony and generally tie pieces together, most of the open-world encounters have little to no plot or reward for your time invested.In comparison to other MMO’s, the amount of content can be scarce, once you have reached your characters level cap and completed the official episodes you will have very little to do, especially if you’re the one to play solo. Playing with a friend or joining a guild will be highly recommended to break the monotony of grinding and the entertainment flowing. While all MMO’s have their fair share of grinding, the problem here is the lack of variety on what to grind at. For a free-to-play MMO, this game does stand-out amongst the rest. It’s well-polished, true to Star Trek lore and canon and an enjoyable experience within a group, and on the plus side, you get to be a Star Ship Captain. As a relatively high-quality product, it’s the community that will once again let it down. Every on-line game has its fair share of elitists and career orientated players that often need to stop and brush the Dorito crumbs from their neck-beards every once in a while and thankfully the community can be filtered out.",Sun Nov 28 15:11:59 EET 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

So read on for the full waffle otherwise...Pros' - Free, Trekkie, Story, Ground & Space combat.Cons - Pricey, Grindy.If you like MMO's, which in gerneral I don't, then you'll probably like this. Theres is plenty of busy work, as I call it, stuff to grind at to unlock better stuff and when you get to Level 50+ you unlock even more busy stuff to keep you busy for litterally hours as well as the usual events that these sort of things have, such as the recent Christmas event, which I joined into too late, so I ignored it.A big word of warning though, the game does a really poor job of explaining most of these mechanics and you'll be left asking the community questions alot.However I have been taking part, mostly, to the 7th Anniversary event that is currently on as of writing. Which again is very grindy and not really my thing but like I said if your into MMO's you'll probably love this, as its abit different to others that I've tried over the years, it has the 3rd person combat, that seems to be most MMo's style but also the space combat, which is also 3rd person, so basically the same combat mechanic really but it does vary it just enough to keep things aleast abit more interesting.However, if your not into MMO's but your either a Trekkie like myself or maybe a fan of RPG, then I would suggest giving this a go as well. As if your a Trekkie then, its a chance to be your 'own Captain', which four different gaming openings which do really good job of drawing you into the story of the universe on offer. However its got too be said that once you get past the opening intros, then it really just sidelines you into either the Federation of the Klingon paths and even them do have cross over stories with each other.But saying that, if your not a Trekkie but an RPG fan, then you probs still like this, as the stories aleast on the first time of playing through are interesting to keep you play.Like I said, I'm not a MMO fan but I am a Trekkie and a RPG fan, so I've been playing mostly just through the story, ignoring all the padding and I'll probs stop playing once I've finished the main game story, treat it just like an normal RPG in essence rather than MMO.And lets face it is free, so why not? However like most games of this time, the in game purchases are rather expensive. To buy a first Tier ship (the first class of ship you can unlock), its basically £5, with the second tier being a £10. And it keeps climbing to tier 6. So obviously I havent spent a penny on it, and at these prices I won't be either. If the ships cost say £1 each, regardless of tier then being a Trekkie I would be more tempted. As you unlock more ships after every 10 levels, luckly you are given a free ship every 10 levels as well, so as you upgraded to a stronger class of ship requirement, the game does let you keep pace without spending money but your selection for a free ship is at most a choice between three, so as a Trekkie your always saying, awww but I want that ship! But given the choice I'd rather spend the money of an actual physical model, so developers making it cheaper if you want my cash!",Thu Oct 29 12:33:28 EET 2020,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

Killers are mostly just AFK which makes the match pointless and no fun, or survivors who are all rank 1 I've had the pleasure of playing with are just bum rushing at the killer to get insta killed, or two of them are doing it to farm points on one another(getting downed while the other heals that downed player repeatedly and vice versa).

Before DR it was fun to get in and play the content, and grinding was not the only focus in the game. However, that has now changed.Don't get me wrong, going from level 1-50 is still as enjoyable as before. It is when you get to level 50 that you feel like you are punished for doing so. The DR expansion gave us a new level cap of 60. However, there is not enough mission content to help you level up.They want us to now repeatedly run patrol missions for stupid amount of times just for one level. This is to keep players in the game longer, instead of offering content to keep players in the game longer, like before.Everything is being monetized. They are revamping things in the game, just to try to monetize it. The crafting system, and now the Bridge Officer (BOFF) system. Also, they created an upgrade system that they are using to monetize on by asking outrageous amounts of Dilithium for them also.Just to clearify, Dilithium is the most expensive resource in STO. It can be used to exchange for Zen (their game store to buy stuff in), or to buy gear that is usualy better quality weapons or gear than mission rewards, or loot drops. There is Dilithium ore, which is what you get for rewards, and Refined Dilithium, which is what you turn the Dilithium ore into. The major problem is that you can only refine 8,000 per day, per character.With the extreme amounts of Dilithium requirements in the game now, it is near impossible for a new player (casual or hard core) to reach a competitive state without paying out real money for Zen to convert into Dilithium. But, before the DR expansion, it was easy for a very casual player to reach a level where they were competetive in just a few months.Instead of fixing isues with the game being unbalanced, they sell power creep. A lot of bugs go unfixed, and many have been in the game since before I started playing.When I first started playing, I would have, and did recommend it to other people. I was able to see the potential the game had. Yet, over the years it has turned into a game that focused on punishing grind after grind to replace actual content. And there is so much grind in the game that it strongly encourages players to spend money to get the new power creep, so you can do it just a little bit faster.The game is now in a sad state. The main developer that oversees the game even admited that he doesn't care what players (their customers) say, and has repeatedly insulted players, and even accused them of exploiting the game, when it was being played as it was designed by them.I would not recommend Star Trek Online till it is no longer about nothing but money, money, money. When the game is turned back into an actual game, then I will start recommending it again. Though, till new management is brought in, or the management they now have will stop focusing on money, and make the game fun, I can't see that happening.",Thu Aug 19 05:49:02 EEST 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

Generally speaking: The endgame is grinding, grinding and more grinding. To get high lvl equipment you'll need ""marks"". To get marks you'll need to either fight in instanced battles (space or ground) or in open world maps (also space or ground).In my opinion Star Trek Online is best played in doses.

It took nearly two years for me to get Grand Theft Auto V, I've only recently gotten Left 4 Dead 2, and I'm still trying to convince myself to get Spore. But after years of playing in the online virtual world ""Second Life"".. and having a lot of fun hanging out with Star Trek roleplayers in SL.. when this game was announced, well.. I went a little crazy.I pre-ordered a lifetime subscription. During beta. I can only speak to the game's features as a ""gold"" member.. but what I can say is that this game is pretty epic.. for what it's trying to be.I had very limited experience with MMO type games prior to STO. I've since learned that some of the 'failings' of my initial reactions to STO were just indemic to the whole MMO drama (flawed animations, no lip syncing to spoken cutscenes, combat that was rudimentary in some areas, or overly power based, etc).Once I got USED to what MMO's are like, I returned to STO, and to be honest, I really do love this game. The graphics are gorgeous, the ship and costume customization options are pretty amazing, and once I got used to all the various powers and systems and things, it can actually be a lot of fun. The story lines can be a little cheesy in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.. there's often a little sarcastic comedy thrown in that keeps doing throwbacks to the various series.The graphics for this game are what amaze me most tho. Every single screenshot I take, looks like something off the cover of a Star Trek novel. Whether it's a space shot, or a picture on an alien planet, walking around starfleet academy, or whatever. It is truly a lovely game.Honestly, if you love Star Trek, and you like MMO's, this game will probably be a great fit for you.And hey, it's free to play. Give it a try.

There is research to do with your officers, setting skill points for yourself and your officers as well as promoting them. There are joint effort missions like Borg invsions to beat. You have away missions on both ships and planets. You can explore the inside of your ship real time and interact with all department heads in each area plus your bridge crew. All ships are fully customizable from interiors to exterior colors. You get a free ship choice on each Rank level you make. All in all I am saying a good game and you really can accomplish a lot with the total free play. But I have to admit there are a few aspects that you might want to put a dime or two into it like for the lock box keys and increaseing your inventory size because you can loose some stuff once it is full and you forget to sell what you do not want. You can play dobble, drink at bars, interact with people on planets and many star systems to explore. And missions are easy to find and get tossed at you often.

Two years ago the game used to be simple and smart, the combat mechanics were easy to learn and you could become a master in several ways.

Moreover, they completely ruined PvP (actually, Devs never cared about PvP, now is unplayable) and, above all, made Engineers and Scientists useless, or at least much lower than Tacticians, since the only thing that currently matters is DPS.I'm Leader of a good Federation fleet, 100% Free To Play (yes, I haven't spent money for it yet, but it's extremely hard) and currently a better player than 99,999% of the community.

While most that have bad releases generally die off after a short period of time, not only has Star Trek Online survived for years, its become a wildly successful MMORPG... and for very good reason. Of all the Star Trek being produced right now, this game risks to cover a period of time that nobody else seems to want to touch anymore: The Future, several decades after the events of Star Trek Nemesis and Deep Space Nine.  I am a massive Star Trek fan. This has made a lot of the single-player games to be very lack-luster to me since most of them force you into a specific role and generally its one of an action hero, something that is contrary to what Star Trek was supposed to be. Other then the adventure games like 'A Final Unity', '25th Anniversary' and 'Judgement Rites', most Star Trek games completely miss the spirit of the show. This game, while having a definite focus on combat, breaks up the fighting with numerous other mini-games, tasks, and puzzles. You can send out crew on away missions, once you hit higher levels and become an Admiral you can send out ships you originally commanded on missions, you can go mining for dilithium, pick up daily missions, work on your reputation with different factions, patrol worlds that aren't even part of a quest, or even play content created by other players and deemed good enough to be placed in-game. If I were to compare this to AAA titles like World of WarCraft I would have to give it and advantage in the sheer number of things you can do to keep the game feeling fun.  Gameplay works very well, especially in space. The ships handle like they should, the weapons are exactly the way they should be, and the powers all seem like they have a place. The graphics are very high-end but can be edited around so you can run the game on lower-tier systems.  I would be amiss if I didn't mention the best part of this game, and that is customization. Hair, facial structure, species, body proportions are all fully customizable, especially if you choose to make a custom alien species! Uniforms are available from every single era of Star Trek including the future uniforms and alternate universe uniforms if you want to spend a couple bucks. You are able to command every single starship made popular by the Star Trek series, from the original Enterprise to the USS Defiant. Some special ships are available as well which only appeared in a single episode like the Prometheus-Class, or the Dauntless. Variations on ships are available as well like the Saratoga version of the Miranda-Class seen in the first episode of Deep Space Nine. A painstaking amount of effort was made to allow players to utilize any ship they wanted, even having ways of using a Constitution Class in the end-game. Of course, when you see the ships designed by the STO team as Starfleets newest vessels you may not want to bother with the original ships since the new designs are exemplary. Most of these ships act as updated versions of earlier ships like the Resolute-Class being a modern overhaul of the Excelsior-Class. There are a few which are completely unique and its obvious the team loves Star Trek because they are faithful to Star Trek while still looking suitably advanced.   Ship Equipment is another way you can customize this game. Their are numerous weapon styles based on the ones seen in the series. Phasers, Disruptors, Plasma, Tetryon, and many more different forms of weaponry all pertaining to even the more obscure species, plus combinations of these different types and special weapons you find along the way, like the Klingon ""Hargh'peng"" Doomsday Weapon killing torpedo. Almost every part of your ship can be upgraded and enhanced, sometimes with interesting visual effects on the ship which can be turned on or off.  I mentioned the crew before but a quick blurb on them is appropriate since they are also completely customizable. You may not get what you want at the start but over time of finding bridge officers and customizing them you eventually will have a ship full of characters you designed yourself, in the positions you want them in.  If my massive gush-fest wasn't enough to say so: In this game, if you cannot find a combination of uniform/ship/crew that makes you happy, you either aren't looking hard enough or you aren't really interested in Star Trek.  The sound is all spot on and its fun to play a captain from the 'Original Series' era because a lot of the effects and sounds are replaced to reflect the more classic style. Much effort has been made to make sure the immersion is perfect, with little touches like the Klingons, Federation, and Romulans having different transport effects. Overall, the attention to detail is impressive and helps make the whole game feel polished. It doesn't hurt that they keep pulling in cast members from the series to voice act their characters in-game. Characters like Geordi La Forge, Worf, the Doctor, Seven of Nine, and numerous others all make an appearance, reprised by their respective actors. It all helps make the game feel that much more authentic.  ON THE OTHER HAND!   Star Trek Online's theme song is suitably heroic and sounds sufficiently 'Star Trek' but the few other songs in the game tend to repeat, making it a little annoying after a while of hearing the same song from Vulcan playing while you are fighting Borg on a damaged Cube. So the music is a low point in this game.   Additionally there are still some graphical glitches that come up, and the ground combat is generally annoying. It is still a sight better then when the game first came out but its like upgrading from a Shark latched onto your leg to a Piranha latched onto your butt. One isn't quite as bad as the other but its still not very pleasent.  There are micro-transactions which can be used to purchase additional ships, appearances, crew members, officers, etc. If you don't mind a little hard work you can get the micro-transaction currency through the in-game resource 'Dilithium'. Not that you really need to buy additional customization because there is already so many options its mind-boggling. While I am not too worried about the transactions I know many people don't like them. Pricing can be pretty varried. This may have something to do with the Dilithium system and the team not wanting to make it easy to get entire ships through in-game grinding, but it can be annoying at times. Entire costume packs consisting of numerous extra appearance options can cost a very reasonable $5.50 USD, but a top-tier ship (T6) generally costs $30.00 USD which can get really pricy. Thankfully once you get one T6 ship you generally are set to go on ships for the forseeable future, you just have to start with upgrading the ship equipment.  In conclusion, it's a fantastic MMORPG that keeps getting updates and keeps getting better. If you are a Star Trek fan and want to command your own ship there is no reason to not play this at least a bit.",Thu Feb 25 16:05:39 EET 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

End game is nothing more than grinding a lame rep.system until a new episode comes out. And with every expansion comes a new rep.system to grind. Now CBS is forcing them to add Discovery content to help push this new Trek show which is a failure. This is what you have to look forward to in the game.

I had hoped for another Bridge Commander with a few ""Mass Effect-equse"" battles. In reality, the ground combat is just awful, essentially pre Mass Efffect 1 combat, and we all know how bad that is. The space combat is similar to Bridge Commander, but nowhere near as fluid. The quests are literally pointless and only serve as a use to tell you to get around the very vast galaxy. The first few minutes are just laughable, the plot is completely unrealistic, even in a Sci-fi world. Sadly, the point I wanted to get to, PVP, with massive PEW PEW PEW space battles, wasn't obtainable. As you have to be a certain level to even have a hope of joining a lobby and then being able to actually survive the Pay-2-Win. Why on Earth they didn't just remake Bridge Commander I have no idea. That right there is a gold mine. After 6 hours of play, I could take no more and freed up some space on my HDD. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it just feels so outdated and unnatural to play.

Infact so much its not only unworthy of carrying the name Star Trek But Its got way to many issues that need desperate fixing.First off anyone thats getting connection issues. I agree That means Connection issues with some of the servers like the account server need to be resolved.Secondly Any maintanence ect. Shard maintanence being done needs more clear posting and further more Why do such a thing with the server up. Take the server down if your gonna do Maitanence damnit.And finaly whoever says this game needs a new Engine. They are right This game is in desperate need of a new engine and badly.Bottom line Cryptic you have let me down and a few other users down with your handling of this game you damn basterds.,Mon Dec 27 19:16:09 EET 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

After getting the game I was surprised how bad it was. Space combat was super tedious and slow, quests were all the same and everything was confined to small areas. How am I supposed to boldly go where no man has gone before when I'm confined to a small area like its an instance? If you've ever played the DnD MMO then you will know what I mean. It was the first MMO that I didn't play out the free month. They would have had to change pretty much the entire game for it to be good. By all means get the game and play it, but do so before you shell out a dime of your money.",Mon Feb 17 19:00:55 EET 2020,36632203-f738-4537-9a19-0a723bfe371a

It's heaven for theorycrafters. Every so often however, Cryptic might release a new skill or item that makes one type of build the flavour of the month and in one case it can shadow all other builds, which are left in the dust.That's always the risk in a game where every class can access virtually every skill.The game merges two types of gameplays, the ground combat and the space combat. They work and feel different and you are able to concentrate only on one if you don't like the other. While levelling you might need to do a little bit of both, so depending on your tastes it might be either welcome variety or a minor annoyance, until you get to end game and are completely able to pick what kind of content you want to play.The ability to walk around your ship and starbases also allows plenty of opportunities for RP if you are into that. Talking of which the character costumisation in this game is on par with games such as Aion, if not better. The graphic style is not Asian, but when you can pick things like the length of your fingers, you know you can do almost anything.The game isn't necessarily pay to win, although items from the Zen store do have their advantages. If you have the time to grind, you can exchange in game currency for Zen (which you can buy with real cash) but the process is considerably slower.Overall Star Trek Online is an underrated game which has kept me busy for way more hours than most other MMOs I have played. In fact only one other MMO managed to beat it.",Tue Jan 11 09:11:36 EET 2022,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

These include gameclient.exe errors, random crashes to desktop (without a report feature), crashes to desktop (which do trigger the report feature), disconnects, and memory leaks.In the 36 hours preceding this review, my client crashed out 23 times on an Asus 673JH-A1 with up-to-date drivers, making STO one of the buggiest games I've ever encountered. (This also takes the prize from Trion's ""Defiance,"" which gained quick post-launch notoriety for its bugs, glitches, and other game-breaking features.)Company technical support, or lack thereof, complicates the picture. Cryptic is known by this point as ""Chronic"" due to their persistent inability to launch a major patch without breaking at least one major feature - leading to at least 2-5 subsequent patches to fix whatever was originally broken. Technical support is also nonexistent, meaning you're on your own for troubleshooting and support.In short, definitely would not recommend this game.Update: After not playing the game for about 4 months, I reinstalled it on a whim and was promptly met by 3 crashes in an hour. At this point I'm giving up. No game is worth this level of aggravation.",Thu Oct 28 15:29:58 EEST 2021,36632203-f738-4537-9a19-0a723bfe371a

However, I think it is fair to say that I will lay down what I feel about this game in a rather fair form. For the longest time, there have not been many great attempts at recreating the Star Trek universe in a game. Some of the best Star Trek games I would argue; go back to the late 1990's and early 2000's; where Star Trek Armada, Klingon Academy, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force and Bridge Commander were some of the best titles. Later down the road; such as the mid to late 2000's, you had some titles but none were particularly worth playing. Star Trek Online comes around, and yes: The launch was dissapointing for many who expected it to be a in-depth Bridge Commander style game; not to mention other details seem to have went missing from the game. This is partially due to the collapse of Perpetual Entertainment and the acquisition and development over to Cryptic. The game originally was a monthly fee based game; but eventually it turned Free to Play. I played it for a while years ago but have since been convinced to pick it up and see how it is.I have to say, I am quite impressed with it. The game overall makes you feel like you are in charge of a ship and you even go under the sensation of living in the shoes of a captain; the amount of things to do and the quality of the mission narratives makes the game rather interesting and not so much a typical boring MMO. Pros:1. Free to Play system is fair. (There is purchase content, but it doesn't upset balance.)2. Customization galore. (Ships, uniforms, officers, loadouts, etc. Lots of cosmetic choices.)3. Solo friendly environment. (You don't need to be with others to succeed. You can team up; but the game doesn't require it.)4. Large Officer roster. (Bridge officers that can operate your ship's systems. Assign teams to go away on missions outside your ship.) 5. Space combat mechanics. (Want to focus shield energy on a given side? Want to increase power to weapons? You are in control.)6. Not a grindfest game. (Want to hit the level cap? This game doesn't make you spend countless hours of your life to get to that point.)7. Foundry missions. (User generated missions that have their own plot and objectives. They can vary in quality; but it is player freedom.)8. Star Trek MMO. (Star Trek fans like this. This is totally not obvious, right?)9. Mission types. (Not every mission involves combat or fighting, some are simple scan or repair missions.)10. Mission narrative. (Some missions make you think of yourself fulfilling the role in a Star Trek episode.)Cons:1. Player community. (It is a free to play game, so this is sort of expected. Players get too political sometimes and often immature. Sometimes it is difficult to make inquiries in chat, etc. Not everyone likes this kind of environment.)2. Enemy bosses. (This is more of a annoying trope than a real problem. Enemy bosses such as the ""villain"" type always seem to escape you.)3. Linear missions. (There are plenty of them that offer different solutions to a problem; but many missions don't have multiple outcomes.)4. Away team issues. (The away teams that you bring into combat will never try to revive you unless they are not fighting. Sometimes Away team members don't maintain unit coherency.)5. Some visuals. (Some planet textures on even the highest settings still look blocky and ugly.)6. Customer service. (The customer service is known to be on the poor side. Lack of sincerity and cooperation when issues arise in cases.)Overall, this MMO is definitely worth playing; even if you are not into Star Trek; the game itself is quite entertaining and full of things to do. There is a lot of purchase content; but it isn't required to actually succeed in playing and enjoying the game.",Sun Dec 19 01:20:51 EET 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

Namely, I started playing it when it first launched (and it was a subscription based MMO). Cryptic did a good job, but to be honest, they launched it too early, and it felt like it was halfway done.  The Federation side had a good amount of content, but the Klingon faction, did not.  So after playing it for about a year, I took a break from it (a year plus break).  Coming back to it after so long, even after it went F2P and Cryptic was bought by Perfect World Entertainment, I must say, Cryptic has done an excellent job in expanding the universe.  Not only did they launch a third faction, the Romulans, they also fully fleshed out the Klingon faction.  They also updated the trait system, kit system, and R&D system, while continuing to create Featured Episodes.  That, along with a more robust Foundry (a system that let's the community create playable missions to share), I must say, I've gotten hooked on this game once again.",Sat Oct 10 12:33:16 EEST 2020,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

And i have played since closed beta.)Overall quality of this game is bad. Ive been with this game since its beta and it was shipped unfinished to meet a contract deadline, they (the devs) admited this. Major problems from the beta are still present in the game now years later. devs barely update the game at all and when they do it normaly breaks it worse for a few months then it goes back to what it was before with like one spelling error fixed in one converation nobody reads anyway. The games ingame store makes the game pay to win, but all that money you are paying them they are not putting towards developing the game.  Feature episodes (their version of a tv show episode) which are kinda like mini events that move forwards the timel ine of the game and cost alot of dev time can most of the time out of a 6 weeks for 6 parts series be completed in 30 minutesabout 5 min for a part some of the parts are purely walls of text to read and complete in less then 2 min.Actual gameplay of this game is in a word repetative. Go here kill this. Go here collect this. Go here kill this to collect this. Completely missing the point of the story telling that was any of the TV shows, starfleet rarely uses lethal force or force at all to achieve there goals but thats all you do in this game. Once in a blue moon you come across an interesting quest line but most are sub par, literaly narrow hallways with the entrance on one end, 4 groups of enemies to kill and a conversation at the end. Time to max level in this game taeks about 4 to 6 weeks. Ground combat in this game is a joke it lacks anything to make it fun, boreing interiors for all but 6 missions. Space combat is not in much better shape but at least they spent time here usualy interesting looking locations but still repetative combat, enter mission - kill 4 groups - conversation - leave.Dev comepletely fail at understanding how to make a game. There are enemies in the game that have a 0% chance to miss you and deal 10 times your health and sheilds combined both in ground and space. This is to add ""challenge"" to the game when in reality they skimped out on making the game made it kill you so you would have to eather try again and hope you DPS it to death before it can react or you grind some repetative mission to crap xp to become higher level then the guy to go back through the whole mission again to kill him and continue the sub par story that you dont even remember why your in the same exact looking base killing another dude.While most of this game is complete crap they have at least done some interesting things to the cannon star trek story line and is at least worth playing for a month to get the story if your a star trek fan. And some of there latest content that last big update adding the delta quadrant is rather good story and gameplay wise they actualy broke there own molds for missions in this last update, the main enemy in these missions is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fight in space since it can one shot even the most tanky crusier you have with a massive nearly unavoidable AOE in space, but other then that its rather good. Also while this game is lacking in most areas it is a fun game to paly with friends. Also making your character in this game uses one of the best systems ive ever seen in a game you can control almost all aspects of your characters looks. The create your own missions portion of the game called the foundry is also an interesting idea and fun to do some times. More often then not the community comes up with better missions then the devs do.I do not recomment this game for anyone at this time, maybe in a few years it might be worth recommending to people but not at this time.",Sun Jan 17 01:06:29 EET 2021,84d1b7cd-0282-4efd-bdde-3e3b54fe8a28

You don't need to actually use the said ship to use the trait, all you need is to buy it, then ""level"" the ship(which is quite fast if go somewhere where you can destroy many ships).3 - Every new ship can use one of the specializations(atm there are intelligence(incredibly strong), command and pilot), the old ones can't, and cryptic made it clear they never will be capable of using it, in other words if you're using old ships, you're locked out of new game content, isn't it amazing?Now for that exception, there is a ship called the scimitar, which is by far the best ship in the game due to the sheer amount of damage you can dish with it(which is kinda fair, since it was OP in the movies too), but make no mistake, cryptic has made it clear they intent on releasing every old iconic ship as a tier 6 version, so you can re-buy everything again(isn't it nice?), so its a matter of time till they re-release the scimitar.Cryptic also added ""crafting"" which is basically RNG-based gambling so you can get a weapon with the mods you wish, you also need to use it if you want take your weapon to highest tier, which is VERY costly, even more so if you're trying to get them to increase in rarity(unless you happen to be a bored billionaire from dubai or something, don't try to increase rarity, its stupid).So to summarize, cryptic took a game with a booming population, which had a very casual, forgiving and fun playstyle, and turned into a boring grindfest, outright lied to the playerbase, and refuse to fix it, even though the population continues to drop as a direct result of said changes. Cryptic has been trying desperately to reverse this by doing everything BUT reversing/improving on what they did, its not working and it will not work, because in the end, the game is still boring.My recommendation? stay the hell away from this thing, if you insist on playing this trainwreck, be a romulan tactical captain aligned with the klingons, get a scimitar and the 1000 zen nausicaan ship of the klingon side, it will give you the best console in the game, the plasmonic leech, you don't need anything else.I'll change this review if cryptic fixes those issues... which i seriously doubt will happen.",Mon Jan 17 00:51:31 EET 2022,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

They implemented a lot of new features, quests and events so a PvE player might be very satisfied BUT if you are looking for PvP you should look elsewhere. The entire game changed from different fighting factions to a bunch of excel sheet reading damage maximizing grannys in pink pyjamas. They only maximize their gear to get better gear and to sit in their space stations dreaming of big fights which will never happen as nobody ever plays any PvP. So if you look for a complex game with seasonal events and story you are at the right place but you will never use your gear in player combat ever again. So even if I have a lifetime abbonement I will not bother downloading the game again. The Peace corp took over the game which is sad and destroyed the game at least for me.",Fri Nov 05 03:28:25 EET 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

Still though, I WOULD give this game a good review, for all the fun i had with it. but after taking a year haitus to play other games, i came back wanting to play with my little brother, who loves star treck, only to find out I had been banned for ""selling in game currency"". I may have been hacked, no big deal, happened to me in GW2 as well. So i contacted their support about it, in response i got a rude message saying that I shouldn't have been selling currency, and that my ban was permanent (I believe the message was copy pasted).

After all, I never got that far because tech support was unable to answer a simple query concerning which domains to whitelist (other than perfectworld.com) in order to get it running on a secure system. Let's start from the beginning:.My system is specially set up so that JavaScript, etc.,  runs correctly on my system only when served from a whitelisted domain. From any other domain it gets shut down - which is how I know that STO is served, in part, from unspecified domains other than perfectworld.com and these other domains are, consequently, not whitelisted by my security. .What takes the cake is that, when I asked tech support for the domain names which needed to be whitelisted for the game to work, they responded by stating that the game works for “millions” of other people - which dodged the question by employing an argument by irrelevance; a form of sophistry known as a fallacy. I have to wonder if these guys even bothered to read the support ticket I lodged (given their total failure to comprehend the problem I raised) and why they couldn't simply address my question (as opposed to addressing some purely imaginary complaint).  .Now, when support techs start engaging in sophistry, it can mean that they are more interested in griefing the customers than doing their job. Moreover, this reflects very poorly on management, for obvious reasons; principally because it demonstrates the attitude that they can do no wrong and it is always someone-else's fault which, ultimately, gives rise to a fundamental disrespect for the customer base..The bottom line is that I recommend strongly against STO and, moreover, I will not be reviewing this game again until I see some sort of evidence that key management changes have been made which facilitate policy implementation designed to ensure that customers are not systematically marginalised for the apparent crime of asking for some technical support.",Sun Dec 05 17:33:35 EET 2021,84d1b7cd-0282-4efd-bdde-3e3b54fe8a28

Action - Adventure - Science Fiction - Gene RoddenberryStar Trek Online is... nothing like Star Trek, now give us dat money! - Perfect World EntertainmentSadly, this game has barely anything to do with Roddenberrys Star Trek apart from some name dropping and voiceover works from the actors.It is heavily combat focused, to the point where almost every single mission will require you to shoot down hordes upon hordes of goons both in space and on the ground.The missions and tasks you perform in this game are linear. All of them. Avoiding combat, alternate solutions to the tasks at hand, using technobabble to get out of a tough situation are not here - You rarely even get fetch quests for most of the storyline as the game reduces you to ""go there, kill everything"".And to add insult to injury, the post-scarcity world of Star Trek has seemingly been taken over by the Ferengi. Not only is there a player economy based on ""energy credits"", but a multitude of currencies including ore you mine with a daily cap for refinement, premium currency Zen, Ferengi Lobi Crystals and many many more.Now all of this would be bad but okay if the game offered any kind of depth or fun gameplay, but instead it sadly can't even hold up to the lowest of Korean grinding MMO standards. Forget about playing a healer or a tank - DPS rules supreme. Ground combat is even more dumbed down.It is painful to say, but Star Trek Online which once set out to be the continuation of the original timeline of Star Trek has become little more than a skinner box of shallowness and pay to win mentality.

Movement can feel clunky. Animations are sort of stiff. Sometimes the lag monster can really bite you. Even though getting to max level isn't bad, the reputation grind can be. The store isn't the worst, but its obvious that if you want cool things, you are going to have to dish out $5 here, $10 there. Unfortunately, there are premium ships that come with modules that you can only get that way, so for PVP this translates to pay-to-win.The stuff I like: The space combat is fun and it does feel like to you captaining a ship. The 'dungeons' (STFs) are kind of neat and its cool how they made space combat bosses. It's also a solid MMO to play casually without any of the big spenders getting in your way. You won't feel left out by not paying for things in the game as the only content you will be locked out of are certain premium ships (and their special universal modules).I would recommend this is you like Star Trek and are looking for this sort of game.",Mon Jun 21 03:48:13 EEST 2021,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6

While the game is a great game one of the biggest down sides that caused me to stop playing the game is the constant grind to level up just so you can play the next story driven mission.  Sure it is easy to level up but it just gets old doing the same thing over and over again just to get to some new content.  The game when I came to it wasnt too bad but with the release of the fleet bases the game became a very huge dilithium sink which is now starting to level off some as dilithium values have dropped as majority of people have already finished their bases.I do recommend this game because you can put many hours in it but be warned you will have to do a grind to get to some stories as the story missions do not provide enough XP to level up from one story to the next.,Tue Jun 22 12:08:16 EEST 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

But, the core mechanics always make this frustrating for both sides. I'll explain why:\n\nHitboxes. Many of the hitboxes are ludicrous, from Huntress throwing refridgerators, to hits through pallets, to pallet stun hit detection... they make the game frustrating for both sides.\n\nBalance. Heavily skewed towards survivors, who have a total of 8 second chance perks, and 3 boon totems which you would be hard pressed not to run, since they counter hex totems, including the newest which restores broken totems: Pentimento.\n\nMap Design. This goes back to Balance, but maps are heavily in survivors favor most of the time. Some are exceptions, like Shelter Woods or Azarovs, but most killers, especially 110 speed killers, cannot deal with them well.\n\nWeak Killers. This makes it so that survivors don't have to put in a ton of effort to survive. With looping as the main source of chases, many killers are designed to counter that, with nothing else. I think the best example of this was pre-nerf deathslinger. He was great in a chase, but garbage with everything else. Behavior also actively nerf killers who displease the most vocal survivor mains without giving a proper rebalance. Case in point, Deathslinger. He was able to instascope and shoot, with a slightly smaller Terror radius. They increased the Aim Down Sight and TR... but didn't give him anything to compensate for that. Many killers can't be used because they are not viable against the slew of second chances the survivors will throw at you during the match.\n\nThe Meta. Most survivors stick to some version of the meta: Three second chance perks (Unbreakable, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Iron Will, Inner Healing, Any Boon totem, most likely circle of healing), and one exhaustion perk to extend chases (Dead Hard, Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Lithe, Head On... etc.). Since Looping for survivors is easy, many just use Dead Hard as their preferred choice, as it was buffed to ignore good timing from killers. It's the equivalent of a get out of jail free card, and is frustrating to play against when they consistantly use it.\n\nThe Bugs: Due to the poor coding skill of the devs, bahaviour is riddled with bugs and hacking possibilities. Lag-switchers, blatant hackers, DDossers, Doxers... you name it, you'll have a chance to run into them because they don't even try to fight against these. Hell, if you wanted to you could mod yourself auric cells and nobody's the wiser. This doesn't even touch on the bugs the devs add themselves. It's well known by the DBD community that every patch, behaviour adds more bugs, sometimes to seemingly irrelevant things. \nThis is due to the method of coding they use, Block coding, which often creates lines of spaghetti code for them to sift through and try to fix. It's overly difficult for large projects like this. Only a massive overhaul of their existing code will concretely fix the problem, but the devs will never do this.\n\nThe Attitude of the devs. This is the biggest problem. There are three monetization methods within this game: Buying the game, Paid DLCs, and buying Auric Cells. THIS IS SCUMMY AND SHOULD BE REDICULED, BUT THE COMMUNITY DOESN\""T CARE ANYMORE.\nThe devs also have blatant bias towards one side of the game. Often times they will add mechanics or nerfs to killers that never needed them or needed a rebalance. They added a pointless overheat mechanic for Billy and the aforementioned 'Slinger nerfs. Most decisions are for the survivor's benefit, but that is because they know that survivors are their biggest source of income. However, for me it is at the point where I can't stand playing this game anymore because of the continual changes and nerfs to one side but not the other. I remember when they started doing proper balance, but that is no longer the case.\nOn a side note, the DBD forum mods are really egotistical. I got banned for arguing for certain changes that they didn't agree with, and one mod even is moderator for one of the most toxic streamers in the community. They encourage toxic survivor behavior within their own game. I mean, Dwight, the poster boy of survivors, is based off of the project lead's likeness! Same with Jake and another member of their team! Their responses to genuine criticism are often ignored, and the only reason certain changes happened are due to the project lead (I refuse to use his name) going against a professional team. They don't play their game at the skill level required to make balance choices, nevermind if they even do at all!\n\n\nThe game, and the community surrounding it, is a mess. If it wasn't one of the few crossplay games out there, I would have left it behind long ago. All of the fun has been sucked out from it, and everyone plays too sweaty for it to even be called playing anymore.""",Tue Dec 14 21:34:28 EET 2021,16c54f00-1cb1-4c8d-9cc7-38895a645882

Be aware-Actually one of the more decent MMOs I've played. Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",Fri Jan 07 09:22:54 EET 2022,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

Such as more inventory space for free, and bank space. We are currently in Season 9.5 A New Accord. The .5 generally brings some modifications to game performance and what not. We should expect some new things, in Season 10. For now however, I have been exploring the STO Universe, making new friends, discovering new things, and more! I still do greatly recommend the game, for newcomers to STO, you guys get an updated Tutorial :3, but have fun, and never give up!*REVIEW POST UPDATE 4/6/2014 1:12 PM (PST)*The game has greatly improved over the past year that I had been playing it. Although, the Dyson Sphere can use some work, as there is a huge bug where the ground below you spazzes out, but other than that, a very great game. You might see other people that are Vice Admiral(Level 50 [Max Player Level]) and might make fun of you or something related, just ignore them. There are very few Vice Admirals' out there that would help newcomers into the STO Universe. I became one of these people and help any newcomer that I see that is in trouble, when it comes to a mission, friendly stroll in Sector Space, or some casual talk. I think every newcomer into the STO Universe, should remember one thing, Never give up. What you see there, was something I learned when ranking up within STO. If you need any help, low level or not, you can always message me In-Game(If online), or send me a Friend Request through Steam, message me and I will get back to you ASAP. I really care to help out newcomers into the STO Universe, it's a really fun and addicting game.

No, the real frontier awaiting exploration is the vast array of choices you can make, from designing a ship & character, to changing your destined route through different verbiage or a vernacular of missions peering through an almost unveiled veneer of polished textures on older models.Now, to start the real review it goes without mentioning that the user interface is hectic and as a UI designer I would love to be part of the team that built it so I can fix foolish placement and bad design. Not being an option the next best route is the tutorial, which explains the nuances displayed by most of the engine, leaving your curiosity to work out the quirks without making the player feel dumb. One piece of the game that is certainly lacking though is the ship combat controls which can be hard to maneuver when there is more than one enemy, having to disengage and focus on fighting but move far enough away as not to be affected by the blast of a destroyed enemy vessel.I would like to see this game receive a new launcher, some improvements to its UI, and polished cut scenes made on the current version of the engine before it receives an overtly high score, but I feel it's deserving of something above the middle ground as not only does this game try to draw you in, holding you hostage in tense battles for hours at a time, but it also returns a nostalgic feeling, one I last felt on the launch of Old School Runescape and a feeling I long to continue experiencing as I delve full time fervently further into the fabric of ths formerly forecasted foothold, frequented by funny but frustrated friendly men seemingly of fraternity fraudulentity.

Every now and then I may join a group mission and take on the Borg or what have you but the choice of races (Federation, Klingon, and Romulan) and different starting stories are really well done. Some missions seem to cross-over to the different races but there are some unique missions for each race as well. If you are a fan of any of the television series' then there is something here for you as all are respresented: TOS,TNG,DS9,VOY,ENT and that is a good thing. The gameplay is darn good and it look nice at max settings but nothing to compete with AAA titles. The ground misisons are fun and the space battles are awesome. The misisons are set about like episodes from the television series and there seems to be so much to do and there is variation depending on your race.You can upgrade your ships and get better ships as well  as your equipment for ground based misisons. I think if the game had a little more polish on the UI and the graphics/animation department this could be in the running to be the best MMORPG out there but as it is F2P you really should give it a shot.

The combat is fluent and the dialogue is near-perfect.However, there are only two things wrong, small things, but non the less they are essential. The frist point being my character has no voice and for such a star studded audio presentation it deterierates into laughable situations where it's a very serious moment, everybody panicing and there's me, stood there, emotionless and voiceless.My second and final complaint it the ship.

Though it suffered from a difficult start and bumps along the way, the game has continued to evolve and grow. The PvE aspect of the game has become expansive and can seem a bit overwhelming at times for new players. With so many systems integrated over the years from Duty officer missions and abilities, Reputations systems, countless gearsets/combinations, greatly improved crafting system finally in place, and of course the missions both official and player created, the game feels mostly complete and whole finally. Like any MMO it will continue to evolve and not always in a direction everyone will be happy with. That said the Development team generally gets it right. The free to play aspect is among the best I have encountered in all my thirty years as a gamer and the last ten or so with my encounters with free to play models. There are items a player would need to purchase for endgame such as ship upgrade tokens, fleet modules, and a removal of the energy credit cap. All items mentioned can be purchased with either cashy money or in game dillithium converted to game currency through the dillithium exchange. Now for the bad. The PvP is woefully lacking in improvement and attention since launch. While it can be entertaining the public qeues are so one sided and have been since a few months after launch. Abilities are often unblanaced to a fault. Often you are stuck with either the cookie cutter flavor of the month builds, abilites, Duty officer combinations. Even if you have a great build you can expect to lose unless you have a mostly coordinated team all geared and built to provide the DPS and support needed to win. I would not recommend PvP to any new player without first consulting with a PvP group in game sadly. As for the bad part of the PvE side, The Special task Force missions and Advanced Qeues have become a DPS race. You need to participate in advanced Qeues to get items needed for reputation gear. Often if you need reputation gear you are not in a position to contribute much to the team. another. Another issues is the complete lack of need for the Enginner and Science professions in game. In space missions and PvP they are vastly less valuable than a Tactical captain because they cannot produce the same kind of DPS. Having had thirty eight Max level characters before Delta Rising and Six after fully geared and tested to a minimum of 15k DPS and some to as high as 35k (Good but far from great measured by the Infected Space Advanced Standard) and often coordinating for PvP and having written a few of the build guides over the years I feel qualified to say this. It is just the nature of the game for now and may change with balancing as time goes on. On a final note for the PvE is a lack of attention to some bugs, though not game breaking, they can be irritating.All that said if you are still here I completely recommend this game. The good vastly outweighs the bad and I will continue to play so long as this is true. See you out there.",Mon Nov 15 20:07:39 EET 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

First they send you on a stupid quest to exact some justice on some lame fool who did something bad (insert short mission story line here), and when you finally get the guy and retrieve the spoils of battle from his cold dead corpse you have to run for days back to the quest giver to turn the mission in. So, for over an hour of gameplay you actually only played the game for maybe 5 minutes.  Not the case with Star Trek Online.In this space faring MMO you are the captain of your ship. You get to go out and have adventures and all that of a regular MMO with the flare of Star Trek. Along the way you can meet some characters from the shows. All that is to be expected. What was surprising was they way can get your quests. Like most MMOs you can walk up to a quest-giver and talk to them and they will give you the quest. In Star Trek Online you have the option of Calling them from your ship and selecting the mission from the list of available missions. It's almost as if the creators knew that you'd be a long, long way out in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't want to continually run back to to them just to turn in a quest. It is Star Trek, after all, why not just put them up on the main screen, Number One, and we can get on with our mission?Overall the graphics are basic for what systems can pull these days, and the voice acting in ok. The gameplay is a MMO game so you quest a lot. If you are a fan of Star Trek like me then you can forgive the game a lot and play for fun. At the sweet price of free, you don't even really need to be a fan to try it and see if space adventuring is right for you. Just keep in mind, if you are looking for the next blockbuster MMO to scale the mountain and dares all to knock them off of it, you're looking in the wrong place.

The space missions are fairly fun, the plot is interesting enough, but unfortunately, during the time I played, it still lacked some meat. Ground missions were not very entertaining--especially as I wanted to be *in space*--and once the main arc is done, you're out of decent PvE content to do with a friend. That, then, leaves space ""events,"" PvP and guild activities, the last of which depends wholly upon how organized your guild is.

I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one. I am going to give this game a 8/10 as it has 100's of hours of gameplay, regular updates and a vast community; but let down by its small glitches.",Sun May 23 00:44:16 EEST 2021,fc196f94-b366-4378-815a-62b874de0ec2

Can sometimes be a little repetitive at times but that rarely takes away from the fun. From the creative story mode to the awesome end game STF missions, there is a little something for all Trek fans. Well except J.J. Trek fans as this game's story is a continuation of the ""Prime"" Star Trek universe, meaning the game takes place in same timeline as all the T.V. Shows and 10 of the movies. (The story takes place in 2409 about 30 years after Nemesis.) Federation, Klingons, and Romulans are the playable factions and while on the surface they play similar; there are more than enough differences to make each faction unique and make you want to try each one at least once.This game has microtransactions that include ships, uniforms, sevices, and extra characters but in all honesty; you can play the entire game and have a blast and never spend a penny. Also, it is possible through farming and grinding to purchase anything from the ingame store without spending real money. The entire game is available if you want to work for it and since the game is so much fun; it never really feels like work.All in all if you are a fan of Star Trek you should give this game a try. It's F2P so there is nothing to lose but everything to gain.

It takes longer than most, which is something I really have to give the developers a great deal of kudos for, but eventually, you're going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. Something that helps combat this is that it has the concept of user-created missions. You can actually get on a special account type and create missions for others to play. These range from the awesome to the ""meh"", and is another unique feature to STO.The fact that this is free to play, and the paid addons are reasonable, makes it definitely one of the better MMO's out there.

Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",Sun Oct 24 08:34:41 EEST 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

It tends to lose itself in the background noise of every other MMO around. It does nothing really special, but it is fun to try to design your own ship and uniforms, and pick your own crew. The only real criticism of this game is the same that I have of every MMO: you are not unique. You have the same gear, access to the same missions, and are captain of a starship just like every other player. Areas around planets and space stations are clogged with dozens of starships, all captained by players. I feel this is evidence of a systemic assumption in MMO design, that players don't want to work for anything. I feel it would have been far more compelling if they required you to work up to being a captian with your own ship.From a technical standpoint, I have constant issues with the servers being down. I often get significant lag followed by the termination of my connection and (when I try to log back on) the server is down. This is not an occasional thing. Just about every time I sit down to play. I'm pretty positive this is not an issue on my end, as I don't encounter this problem anywhere else. As a result, I've not been able to play this game as much as I'd like.Over all, I think it has some value in the idea that you get to see a lot of cool Star Trek stuff. And, if played for free, this can be worth while (and the reason for my recommendation). But I wouldn't pay for a rather bland game with so many server issues.",Wed Apr 07 23:11:12 EEST 2021,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

I would say about 7/10.First, as a Trek fan I enjoy that it continues the story of the Prime universe, and that there are tons of call backs, references, and even cameos.Now, when I started, I admittedly felt like the controls were a tad awkward, but once I got used to them. I've found that that's all I really needed: to get used to them.The space combat is highly reminicent of what's seen in the shows/movies, even including attacks/abilities that can be traced to commands given by the various captains across the generations.The ground combat/missions could be better, but I personally find them tolerable.The graphics are good, but not fantastic, and it tells a good story overall.Also, if you love the ability to customize virtually everything(no, that's not an exageration), you'll get a kick out of this game. You can customize your outfits, your ships(with some restrictions based ship's class/type etc), alter your bridge officers, and even create your own species.The crafting system is a bit tedious, and materials are hard to come by, but it's not horrible.Now, if I had to name my biggest issue with this game, its the same as most MMOs: the microtransactions. By using real money to by 'Zen'(100 Zen = $1), you can unlock a lot of stuff, but some of it is kinda petty and/or overpriced. For example if you want to get a new ship past level 50(that's appropriate to your level), you better be willing to pay out $25 PER SHIP. Granted,, there are other ways to secure new level appropriate ships, but most are geared for LV 50, and require grinding for special currencies to aquire.Also, I have to say I've notice the community tends to be a bit juvenile.  Even though there do appear to be some more mature people among the community, by and large I would recommend just soloing unless you really need help.So, overall the gameplay is enjoyable and good for Trek fans, plus it also has some good storytelling and decent graphics. But, the petty money stuff and largely immature community are a bit offputting. If you are a Trek fan, or just love MMOs with lots of customization and decent story, check it out, and enjoy some nostalgia.If you aren't a Trek fan, can't stand stupid players, or hate microtransactions...feel free to give it a try, but it may not be for you.",Mon Dec 06 22:22:31 EET 2021,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

My hours on Steam are not accurate as I have played this through the STO launcher, Champions Online launcher, and Arc. As someone who has well over 1000 hours invested into this game, I feel obligated to tell you this game is in no way P2W or paywalled. The people who say these things are either bad at the game or can't be bothered to get dilithium and buy ships. NO ship is overpowered, bar the Scimitar which is just ridiculous. Some ships excel at their role, yes, but there is no overpowered. PVP is dead, so anyone using that as a measurement is fighting against people who have invested time into their characters.On to the actual review. STO is a Star Trek MMORPG developed by Cryptic Studios, a company that is really passionate about their babies. There are glorious space battles to be had, as you go from ensign to admiral over your character's career. You start off against the Klingons in tradition Trek fashion and things quickly escalate. Missions are divided into arcs that act almost as seasons, with some very impressive set pieces that are played around with.The character customization is almost overwhelming, with just about every species having a place and the ability to customize your own alien species. This customizability extends to uniforms and bridge officers, who are like your companions in other games. You choose their looks, their weapons, and their abilities. Every character, yourself included, is divided into three careers: Engineering, Science, and Tactical. These give you basic abilities that you can use regardless of your ship, all of which are fairly useful. Tacs excel at damage, sci  toons can pull some space debuffing magic, and engineers are gods of fortifying their hulls with extreme amounts of health. Any captain can pilot any ship, regardless of what type of ship that is. There is no forced progression path into a certain ship.I'll touch on ships here, since that's what we're looking for. There are dozens of ships ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 6. You get a new ship every ten levels, stopping at 40. 40-50 is T5, with everything above 50 being T6. T6 ships can be bought for real money, earned frome events, or bought by converting dilithium to zen. The conversion rate is around 160 dil per zen, which fluctuates a fair bit. T6 ships cost 3000 zen, which might seem like a lot because it is. You can refine 8000 dilithium per day as a basic player, so it'll take a while to earn and refine that much. Once you fall into a nice pattern, this isn't something that seems grindy.The difficulty of the game is fairly low, although the average player might have some difficulties if they aren't aware of how the game works. This is a simple, but shockingly deep game. Don't worry about loot until you hit 50, then find what you want to do. The game doesn't have to be just about damage, everyone has a place.

I've been playing STO since the very beginning, I've always been on and off(that's what she said), and I suppose having a lifetime membership has helped in that regard. After a number of updates, the ground combat, skill system, and crafting have went through a number of improvements, and I enjoy them how they are now. You can play ground combat like a shooter or traditional mmo, but feels good to mix and match now and then.Space combat is the real treat, and plays differently depending on how you equip your ship and what type of ship you use. Large scale battles can be a very nice spectacle to behold.The story of the game starts off about 30 years after the last original timeline movie(Star Trek Nemisis),  and the original timeline events spoke of in the 2009 movie, as such, Romulus has been destroyed. Each story sequence helps explore different aspects of each of the different show storylines. It's also been great to hear Star Trek Alumni reprise their roles.I'm still having fun in Star Trek Online, and will put hundreds more hours into it. You don't have to spend real money if you don't want to, but if you're spending time in the game, it might be nice to give something back every now and then.

You'll play missions where a klingon ally starts gloating about a secret mission you completed, except his highly creative spin on the world turns what was a serious event of near certain destruction, saved by the Enterprise, to a complete turn around of events.I'm extremely picky about games, though not perfect, this is the best MMO I have played in my 25 years of gaming.

Ground combat controls aren't that great, but better than what they were when the game first came out.  When my friends and I first heard about Star Trek, we were hoping that there would be open world(space) PVP.  Where we could cruise around in Klingon Birds of Prey and swoop up on unsuspecting Federation Tactical Noobs.  But alas, another franchise that did not implement an open world PVP server (that I ever found).  Unfortunately this results in STO being a rather tedious grindfest after a while, unless you find repetitive instanced quests to find better gear, etc. fresh and exciting.  $350 in total DLC options? Really?  Unless one of the packs overhauls the game and replaces it with an entirely new one, it's not worth it.  So as a free to play game its a grindfest, but it's Star Trek, so I recommend it if you don't mind the grind.  As far as DLCs go for this game, I really don't recommend putting money into this game at this stage, but if you like to spend $149 on a handful of intel ships, then be my guest.

On the list of positives, there are things like the ship designs (which are really cool), the missions you get to go on (they all feel like actual things you would do if you were in a Star Trek episode), the fact that featured episodes are voice-acted (the most recent, involving the Sphere, has the actual voice of Worf from The Next Generation), the multiplayer element of the game (incl. PvE and PvP missions both on the ground and in space), and the events they run from time to time.  On the other hand, it gets really repetitive after a while...most of the things you do in missions are in text, not in actual minigames that you can play.One way this MMO departs from others is that the combat is not ""click-click-click you're dead"", to put it that way...you actually have to dodge the grenades the Romulans across the room throw, or set up turrets and lure Klingons into a trap.  The game also has a difficulty controller; if you think your missions are too easy, you can change to a higher difficulty for better loot and more of a challenge (seriously, enemy disruptor blasts consume a lot more shield HP in Expert than they do in Normal!).Its downfall is that it gets repetitive after a while.  Missions are usually ""oh, go kill that small fleet of Reman ships"" or ""take an away team down to the planet and scan relics"".  The crafting is also super boring; you need to collect (or purchase) a lot of items to put ship components together.The game has a slight pay-to-play nature, not nearly as bad as I've seen but still very existent.  You'll need ZEN (the microtransaction currency) to purchase some of the best ships, though if you collect enough Dilithium (an in-game currency that everyone is available to collect in fair quantities) you can trade it in for ZEN.  But it's going to take a lot of Dilithium to buy that Osperey Cruiser or Advanced Obelisk Carrier (the best ships cost 2500 ZEN, which is ~350,000 Dilithium, and you can only collect a few thousand per day at most, even if you're subscribed).Naturally there is an element of player-formed alliances; in this game they are called Fleets, and they can participate in otherwise closed battles against AI or other people, but I haven't gotten there yet.  You don't need to be any particular level to join a fleet, but lots of fleets will require that you reach the highest level in the game (currently lvl. 50, which translates to a Federation Vice Admiral).  The community doesn't seem too bad.  Also, leveling is a piece of cake.  All it usually takes is a single mission to gain a level.  Every 10 or so you get a newer, larger, better ship.All in all, I say give the game a shot.  You may find that its repetitiveness gets the best of you.  Or you may be taken away by the scenery as you blow other starships to bits (oh yeah, the graphics are pretty cool).",Thu Oct 03 22:50:54 EEST 2019,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

It's a good ST combat sim SHIP-wise.... It was reminiscent of STSFC: Orion Pirates, but with a 3D environment, and changeable ship components.... Which is pretty damn cool.The downfall to this game is the somewhat clunky environments otherwise... like ship interiors (which are massive... Hallways feel more like gymnasiums) and the combat mechanics... It works somewhat like KOTOR, but not as well. You constantly beat down a barrage of enemies that are all the same, and just clustered to get in the way of your objective... And the missions are always linear...In the series, ship captains are always making life/death decisions, finding diplomatic ways to resolve things, solving puzzles and trying to keep their crew alive in the face of danger. In the MMO, you are forced to either follow the ONE path, with no decisions on your part, or shoot all the enemies in the area to death before they do the same to you. No choice in the matter.Regardless, the ship customization (name whatever you want, even) and having that customization stick, and be displayed... As well as the tedious but flexible system that allows you to earn in-game currency and use it to acquire things without breaking your wallet is pretty awesome. For the customization of characters and ships, as well as the ability to engage in good ship to ship combat (for the most part), I'd give this game a good rating....I'll just be staying off-planet for battles as much as I can.7/10 for this one.

If you actually read through the main stories you will see grammar mistakes and spelling errors which will make you cringe not because im a grammar nazi or anything i can't spell that great either but then again spell check is free and im not making a game and also asking for your money.5). The balls they have to have a sub service for this glitchy and bug infested mess of a free game. Maybe fix your game so its not a horrible buggy mess and maybe more people would wanna sub? Speaking of Bugs and glitches, if you thought Bethesda games had alot of bugs at launch try playing this game were its been out for 8 years and yet everytime you get on you think, ""How is this out of Early Acess?"" The amount of times you will run into Invisible walls in the middle of a wide open street, get stuff in a corner , or just get stuck on things in space. One time i ran into a Systems Sun and i wasn't able to get out of the suns area unless i restarted the gameNo creativity with the missions, most of the missions are Patrol missions but with harder enemies, after playing 3 different factions with 6 characters and all of them play into the same questline but with slightly different ways of going about it depending on if yer Klingon or Federation. Even when you hit lvl 60 and get to play as the Dominion, they have 1 unique chapter, and depending on what side you choose, your just do the beginning missions for each factions but just adjusted to your  level. For a free game its meh, game does a very poor job explaining what you can do in the game, it does a poor job getting you into the game (If you play as the 23rd century federation you meet Daniels while investigating  some weird thigns happening to star base. He introduces you to the Temporal Agents BS whatever and then when you hit lvl 30 ON THAT SAME CHARACTER you go to Danielsagain for a time mission AND HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO YOU LIKE YOU BOTH NEVER MET AND REINVITES YOU INTO THE TEMPORAL AGENTS THAT YOUR ALREADY IN) Seriously whoever did the storyboard, storyline, and story telling in this game should be shot over and over again. They put little to no effort into making sure the game runs smoothly and instead went for loot boxes, spending money on amazingly better then whatever you can possibly have ships, and over charged prices to unlock species. But again, its free so for a free game its slightly above a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and more of a small heap of♥♥♥♥♥♥with star trek flag next to it.Oh and I hope you like small puzle mini games that once again they explain poorly and you'll have to figure out by googling them rather then waste  time on an already half made game.Ive put alot of hours into this game reading the story playing most if not all the missions  i could, and ive had this game since it came out and you had to pay a sub fee for this hot garbage, NOw thats its free and pay2win alot of broke ♥♥♥♥♥es who only have a few hours think its a bee knees, and ya if you only play up to lvl 30 and 40 its great but once you hit 50 you get the full shaft of these developers saying. ""Pay me money if you want nice things.""Im glad the only thing they undated and improved over the 8 years since it launched was to ♥♥♥♥ over people with lootboxes and dangling any ship above Vice Admiral you have to either pay for , or buy a key for a lootbox which you may or may not get a ship.",Sun Feb 21 21:33:52 EET 2021,fc196f94-b366-4378-815a-62b874de0ec2

Both ground and space combat are solid however space combat is easily the better of the two. There is of course the Federation, the Klingons, and the newest faction which are the Romulans.The Romulans have a story of liberation and resistance against a nearly rogue sect of the now shattered Romulan Star Empire. You fly warbirds which at each new rank grant you a new ability only usable on warbirds. All of them can cloak and a later version can even split into two.The downfall of the Romulans in my eye is that they have no great massive ship of their own. I find the Ha'apax Advanced Warbird a bit lacking in that department. And even though you are in fact forced to join either the Federation or Klingons you cannot actually gain access to their T4 and higher ships. So I must recommend a mightier faction, one of glory and honor. The Klingon Empire.The Klingon story is far more diverse and even includes a small portion of the Romulan story, even including the Romulan end mission around lv32. The story ranges from house rivalries and betrayals to the return of Klingon enemies from ancient lore among other interesting developments. The Klingons are a faction with many mighty ships designed for head-on combat that have hull strength only rivaled by ships you'd have to spend $150 opening gambling boxes to get your hands on. And this does not even diminish their offensive capabilities as their greatest ship is a carrier armed just as well as any warship.The Fedration offers little that can compare to the might of the Klingon Empire. Their ships seem to be designed around a doctrine of agility as many of their ships are far smaller but probably just as effective in combat if used properly.There is also a system for crew missions, where you deploy your crew to go do things like sacking a colony, bribery, espionage, fighting in tournaments, trade agreements, asteroid mining for arguably the most valuable currency dilithium, among other tasks. These all net rewards which vary by the rarity of the mission, its difficulty, who's on it, and of course what the mission is in the first place determines the base set of rewards. You can even send one of your crew to be executed for incompetence as a Klingon, which even though its useless is just great to have sitting there as an option.The visuals are good, the game hasn't crashed once for me, the UI is customizable.All in all, a great MMO.",Wed Oct 27 04:47:43 EEST 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

I love...and I mean LOVE Star Trek, my fav series to be made on this planet we call home. Now the biggest reason why I love the game is because you not only get to be in the Star Trek universe and meet the shows Iconic characters. You get to side with one of the three series main factions. (Klingon, Federation, and Romulan) After choosing a faction to play on, you can choose one of the three classes. (Tactical, Science, and Engineering Officers) From here the story starts...you take a long time using the very well thought out character creation to make the best *You* in Star Trek as possible. From that you go ahead and start your missions in the main story. (Each faction will have there own beginning chapters and then it all comes together in the same story/missions) Do note that the Federation faction has a very slow and a little to long of a prologue chapter. Now as a new player that will be great, but I have played over 3.5 thousand hours on a non-steam client, and a few hundred or so on steam...till the steam client broke. Anyway, playing the game as much as I have. You get tired of doing that intro for the Federation over and over again. The plus side to this, they added the 23rd Century Federation as a new faction a while back. This being said you can not only play as a classic Federation character but play a new prologue to play and explore. As for the community. It is full of fun and Star Trek loving roleplayers. Yes roleplay is huge in this game, most if not almots all Fleets/Guilds will have roleplay be a normal part of the day to day tasks. With that said some Fleets will take it more realistic than others but still fun if you can find a Fleet that fits you. Adds tons of hours to the already great game. I have no idea if this review was helpful or just me being a Star Trek fangal...but I do hope it gave some light onto if you want to play the game or not. Anyway thank you for taking the time to read this review and do have a nice day/night.",Thu May 07 07:10:40 EEST 2020,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

Graphics could be better, yes, but this is an MMO, and for what it is, I think they've done quite well with it. I love the pre- and post-warp cutscenes and the transporter animations most, and some of the storyline talking cutscenes the least.The free to play part is a plus, too. It's a quality game, definitely, and doesn't simply lock you out of portions of the game just because you're free to play while others are premium, in fact, with enough effort, I'm sure you could accumulate enough dilithium to trade for substantial amounts of the premium in-game money (zen), which you can then use to buy the bigger, better, shinier, more premium things in the game.On a personal note, I'm happy with the game, and I'll be happy to continue playing. The best part is, once I tire of Federation quests (if I do), I can just make another character and experience Klingon or Romulan quests (you have more than enough character slots to make characters for each side). I think it's great that there isn't an entire side locked up for premium/paying users' use only, I think (though some races -- like the Joined Trill -- are locked up).Being free to play, I feel perfectly safe suggesting this game to anyone.

If you are a Star Trek fan, you have nothing to lose, and you'll probably enjoy what they've done with the franchise and your personal story. I was tempted to buy cosmetic upgrades because I am a nerd (""Ooh they have Kirk's jacket from Wrath of Khan! I want it!""), but I never felt like I had to pay in order to win. You definitely CAN - you can pay real money to buy upgraded ships with special technology - but I never felt pressured to do so.I really like the crew management element of the game - essentially, the special abilities of your ship are determined by your bridge officers. Bridge officers can be requisitioned from Starfleet or acquired on missions, which I thought was a nice touch. You can customize your bridge officers appearances in a very satisfying way, from their appearance and uniform to their stance. I got a boring Trill medical officer and made him much more interesting by making him twitchy and neurotic. Once you've customized a uniform for yourself or an officer, it's easy to save the outfit and apply it to whoever you want.The rest of your crew - rank and file - are mostly just pegs you can shuffle around to complete timed tasks and projects, with a variety of little rewards. I enjoyed this 'Starfleet Spreadsheet Simulator' in kind of a perverse way, sending my little dudes to formulate warp bubble theories and whatnot, but it's mostly a time-waster.The main problem with the gameplay is this: the ship-to-ship combat is much more polished than the away missions, but away missions are where you will spend most of your time. The on-foot sections of the game have very awkward and inconsistent level design. If I could delegate those bits to my redshirts, I would mostly do it, and enjoy the game more.I put it down when I didn't feel like playing it anymore, and I haven't picked it up again since, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing it. It didn't feel addictive or manipulative.tl;dr : Try it if you like Star Trek. It's actually free and not fee-to-pay.",Sat Oct 16 12:49:14 EEST 2021,36632203-f738-4537-9a19-0a723bfe371a

Or the vast overworld that allows you to beam down to many of the iconic locations you've come to know and love, such as Deep Space Nine, Starfleet Academy, Earth Stardock, Risa, and, taken directly from the most beloved film of the series, Paradise City from ST V. (Kidding.) Or just being able to run around your own ship or shuttle, most of which are inspired by, or are of the same class as, the ones from the show/films, and pilot it around the galaxy. There's something in this game for everyone.Since most people here have already covered the big parts of the game, I'll point my own personal list of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Fantastic Campaign: The devs for STO are big time Trek fans, and you'll definitely discover this once you start making your way through the campaign of your choice: Starfleet, Romulan, or Klingon. Each episode is formatted like an episode of the show, most of which are heavily inspired by plotlines from the show and films. Some of the episodes even continue the stories of some ST characters. Some devolve into shoot-'em-ups, but most -- especially the recent ones -- are 100% Trek, on par with the show. There are also player-created missions available to play through by way of the Foundry, which is awesome and something I wish more MMOs would incorporate.- Frequent Updates: Cryptic update the game with major episodic content a few times a year, most of which have featured actors reprising their roles from the series, such as Michael Dorn (Worf), Tim Russ (Tuvok), and Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar). Leonard Nimoy also narrates many key parts of the game in-character as Spock. Each new episode has added new story content, dailies, and general updates -- and all of them have been free. We've had one full-fledged expansion, Legacy of Romulus, and another one on the way in October called Delta Rising.- The Star Trek Experience: A lot went into making the game feel like a genuine Trek experience. The general atmosphere, the scale of the overworld, the missions, the visuals, locations, and characters. You take command of your own ship, and you can pretty much roll up any character you can imagine: from the stock races, such as Human, Vulcan, Romulan, Klingon, Betazoid, Trill, Orion, etc., to a custom alien race that you can define. There are also a lot of RP opportunites: Dabo(!), asteroid mining, ship interiors, and seasonal events. Just a lot of great stuff.- F2P Model: If I had to make a list of the most ethical F2P MMOs on the market... it would be a short list, but STO would be near the top. All of the story, PvE, and PvP content is free, as are all the updates. Most of the things Cryptic are making money off of are cosmetic items (uniforms, ship interiors/exteriors), ships (but the free ships are just as competitive), and services like inventory space, character slots, bank space, etc. The two things that I would count against it are the lockboxes, which can be easily ignored, and the two races locked behind a paywall, though with nearly infinite races available to you, it doesn't make much of a difference in my opinion. With a model like this, I've been happy to support it since I started playing.KHANS:- Sector Space: Initially, it's no big deal, but after some time you start to realize how unintuitive Sector Space can be, sectioned off the way it is. Can you land here, orbit, or do nothing? Why are there invisible walls in space? There's an event here, but is anyone participating? What does the event even entail? Cryptic have stated in the past that they want to give Sector Space an overhaul, which would be awesome, but we still have it for now.- Instance Stagnation: There are a lot of PvE and PvP instances to queue up for. People play a select few, but most have stagnated -- not from lack of players, just lack of interest. I'd much rather them not be there if no one's going to play them, so that Cryptic would be able to put more focus on the ones people still enjoy.- Community: Do yourself a favor and find a good fleet that you can get along with, because the community in STO, at least the vocal part, might just drive you insane. This is nothing new to online games, but it seems abnormal in a Trek game. Part of the reason might be how fragmented chat is in STO, which makes moderation rather difficult. Making chat universal across individual sectors would make things better, I think, but for now reading ESD chat might just make you go blind.I think that about covers it! Like I said, if you're a Star Trek fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a try, especially now that we're on the verge of a new expansion.Live long and prosper!",Tue Jul 07 18:31:33 EEST 2020,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

I read the reviews and decided to pick it up on Stream, as it was free to play, and I was a big Star Trek fan. And it was great... at first. You can level really quickly, though part of that was due to the Delta Rising promotion they had going on when i joined, and the ships were great. Then I got to level 50, and was given access to the Delta Quadrant and Dyson Sphere. All the sudden, the wonderful mission's I'd been completing turned into 5-6 part grinds spanning over different areas, in different systems, in different sectors.... and I had one that I spent almost 2 hours trying to complete because even though I have the best ship in the ""free"" fleet, it does not match up to these enemies. So, unless I feel like spending money of upgraded ships and weaponry, I've gone about as far as I can in the storyline.

This added with crew compilation options, varying abilities, and a vast universe created a game worth playing.

You also have a variety off mission you are able to complete and in a way go get paid when finished. Some of the pay is very good and as much.

It bouldly goes where no asspoop has gone before, except maybe that Star Trek game that costs actually human money.I'm reviewing this for it's gameplay, not plot, cuz I skipped all the story things.First there's a surprisingly non-testicular character creator, this concludes my list of pros.I chose to be a starfleet person for reasons of reasons, and was booped into San Francisco anno 2400 or somewhere around ther, I know it's San Francisco because it's shouted at me trough voice-acting and the golden gate is pushed up into my face. My first quest is to go and talk to someone, so is my second one, and third, and fourth, and fifth (after it let me talk to the guy), and sixth. As my seventh quest I have to go and toast cuz I graduated from space-school or something before I get sent to a spaceship that; MAJOR SPOILERS OF SOMETHING NOBODY WOULD PREDICT IN A GAME AT ALL, the ship gets attacked. You then do yada yada for a couple of minutes (one of which was breaching a door I couldn't quite find because the doors don't work at all and you just go through all of them) before I get to control the ship (which the dialogue might explain but I skipped it. At this point I realised that I have about 71 games that are better than this in my steam library (I have 72 in total as of when I'm writing this) that are a quadrillion times better than this pile of words that would have my steam account banned due to profanity.Conclusion:Pros:Character creator.Cons:The other bit.The character creator is worth the money they're asking, it's a bit much for the rest of it tho.Negative 834762859/10 IGN would exit game again.",Sat Jun 26 19:05:30 EEST 2021,84d1b7cd-0282-4efd-bdde-3e3b54fe8a28

Well after giving it a go I have to say they have and still are doing a great job. There tons to do even if you reach the max level you still get points to spend on your character which is cool. The daily events also help getting rare and important equipment. There are alot of fan made missions as well just in case you want to take a break from the main missions and if you are stuck then other players if you ask will be there to help but the mission will get tougher with the more players in the mission. Also if you like clans then there are more then a few to join. My dislike is that when playing as UFP that sometimes you have to do some past missions you already done just to level up to the level that it wants you to be to carry on in the game which was a let down. But other then that its the best Star trek Game yet and it gets better with friends.,Fri Dec 11 18:59:04 EET 2020,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

The arrangement of your bridge crew adds fighting and mission abilites which is great. Complete customisation of your self crew and ship. The only downside I found was that every mission had you kill emeny ships. Its not very federation if your killing everything.

The game started out great in 2010 with some glitches of course. In seven years it turned into a even more amazing and enjoyable game. As a Star Trek fan I see it as an honor to consider this game as canon as the series and films.

From the moment you create your captain you're at the centrre of a canon storyline, and the game doesn't fail to deliver. EVERY star trek fan should want to sit in a captain's chair though, and doesn't need me to convince them. There is a little something for everyone though. It may sound like a silly aspect to judge, but the single player value to this MMO is insane, which is rare. Weather you party up, pvp, pve, RP, farm, grind or seriously roam around to take the sights it's easy to find something to do. Not just for star trek fans, but as a trekkie obviously worth checking out. Pay to play aspects coupled with ruthless marketing take away from the enjoyment, though everthing purchasable with money is possible to farm or grind for - albeit very tediously. My advice, spend your time having fun with the game until you unlock the end game ships, save up enough game currency to buy keys for lockboxes in auctions and try your luck for high tier ships that way. I ended up purchasing a t6 ship as a reward for hitting the level cap with no regrets. Best:High level of customization and choice 3rd person gameplay while on planet is good, if a little generic. But space battle mechanics are AWESOME. Best space battles in an online game by far imo. Story and lore written in star trek canon, lots of interesting locations, characters and situations trekkies will recognise, but it's not necessary to be familliar with literally any of it in order to enjoyMostly friendly communityGreat graphics, music, voice work, UI, controls, tutorials and a very large, interesting world to exploreDifficult gameplay - not just a matter of spamming a rotation of class abilities-there are tactics involved.Worst:Dev support has left much to be desired, although just for things like gameplay bugs. Community support and store support are dependable. Frequent updates and patching - means more down time, more bugs. Unfortunately most of the updates are made to the store and are designed to make players want to spend money. This would not bother me if previous updates were more stable before attention was made to updating again. A bit buggy. Shouldn't have to explain this. Nothing that breaks the game, but I've had to restart missions enough times that I should probably mention it. Freemium. Hate this. I know it's the future but it takes away from the enjoyment for everyone except the people it exploits. If you don't let this get to you, and indeed it is not SO bad compared to other freemium games, the purchasable items are excellent and there is a large attention to detail and value. Before you purchase anything I reccommend unlocking the lvl 60 ships or higher first. Overall the game is not perfect, may have been better as a subscription game, kinda lost its soul a little bit because of in game purchasing - but the developers and community have managed to keep the game very fun despite the small hangups. The engine and mechanics in this game alone are worth checking out. For the record, this is the only MMO that I've held even remote interest in for more than 6 months. Long story short: It's free, fun as hell, and the main problem is that without spending insane amounts of time mining or spending real money you really can't compare to the players that do. If anyone who plays it and doesn't enjoy it wants their $0.00 back I'll happily refund.",Wed Apr 07 05:19:33 EEST 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

A true sandbox for Star Trek-ness. However, it was taken over by another developer, one known for making comic-like games and generally actionning and arcade-ing things up to the max. My heart sank, because my favourite Star Trek games before then were games that simulated life on board your starship of choice.Bridge Commander for PC was one of those games, I'd go back and download all the old Star Trek games now and then and play them just to see if any were good, and some were excellent. Another was the Interactive Technical Manual/Captain's Chair set of games, which made it so that you could walk through little 360-degree photograph simulations of the ships and learn all sorts of things about everyone. Also one game that gets little to no cred is the Elite Force expansion for PC also, which took the Star Trek Voyager game and made it so that you could explore the ship, mess with the systems, play on the holodecks, and so forth. It took a good 3 hours to push every switch, which isn't long, but it's a good slice of life if you want to experience a walking simulator about ST:VOY. Also the new VR game looks to have some of that spirit - maybe.Star Trek Online is the antithesis to all of that. There's no classic roaming about and taking in the scenery, no smelling the roses, and for some reason the corridors are ridiculously huge - all the bridges and so on are blown up to the size of small soccer fields, even the one for the shuttlecraft looks like a basketball court you could do laps in. It's inulting to me as a veteran gamer, since I'm stuck wondering - ""what, are they expecting so many casual players who have never tried to play an online game before, that they had to make it so they wouldn't be frustrated walking into walls all the time? is it literally made for mentally challenged people?!"" I've never seen a game put so much freaking walking space everywhere. The transporter pads which are supposed to be somewhat uncomfortable to stand on with 5-6 people are suddenly these huge affairs the size of a moderately-priced living room. O_o; smhNo, you could say that STO tries to bring back the feeling of Original Series Star Trek, with Kirk facing a new escapade each episode and generally the ships and life and so forth falling into the background. I used to despise the Original Series for being too fast and loose with ... well, logic itself, frankly. Sometimes, most of the time in fact, the things the crew encounters and their reactions to it make a lot of sense. But now and then there was just no sense to what they were doing at all, and what my mom calls ""60s values"" were everywhere - people getting angry for absolutely no reason, being ""chivalrous"" (almost mocking) towards female crew members, and so on. I've recently watched TOS in its completeness and I have a much greater appreciation for it now, I found the fun in it as it were. But even Roddenberry seemed to back off from the feeling of the original, considering the way that the early Trek movies became almost pedantic affairs about Shakespeare and philosophy and politics. I like those best I think, out of all the Trek stuff that's been created, but this game seems to mostly if not entirely abandon those principles in favor of BANG! BANG! Space cowboys to the rescue!The thing is, it works. The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager all seemed to want to be saying something more fun and action-oriented than they actually did, esepcially in the episodes involving scary new species or little special events featuring warzones. It's like there was this anxious little boy hidden away inside the hearts of the producers, and every now and then he'd come out and for several episodes we'd just have a general romp around the galaxy, with torpedoes blasting around and so on. That's where Star Trek Online shines. It takes the time period from those series and tries to make it work as a series of TV-style episodes, which are crystallized into about a dozen quest chains (yes, that's all there is in the game for my faction, but they are relatively long - several hours at minimum each, more like 12-20 hours for some). Want to see Denise Crosby finally getting some serious attention in any Trek franchise? Well, here her performance as Empress Sela is charming and impeccable.The difference between STO and the actual TV shows is that while some of the best story arcs in the entire Star Trek universe - all the 29th century nonsense, the Year of Hell characters, the DS9 take on the Mirror Universe, and so on - were mostly ignored after their individual episodes and two-parters, the creators of Star Trek Online took the most interesting and audacious ideas and expanded them into significant things which affect everyone on a daily basis almost. More fun, more action, more romping around, more crazy conspiracies and interesting intrigue than the shows were usually willing to do. If the original shows were vanilla-flavored, this is artisinal chocolate with jalapeno sauce. The difference between fan theories and the actual material, especially when it comes to Star Trek fans, is that the fans come up with intellectual extensions that make it cool for nerds but are impossible to justify when you're marketing to a general audience who are just expecting to turn on their television sets and get a decent story. This does the fun nerdy ""footnotes section at the Memory Alpha wiki"" stuff that hopefully you've wanted to see (if you're a Trekkie).I tend to love and play (and review!) games which are kinda poopy when taken as a chance to fulfill one's hopes and dreams about what a person can do in a virtual world, but are immensely enjoyable when played on their own terms. This is a game which is best played on its own terms. It tries to take the pre-reboot storyline and tie it together with almost everything that's ever been created in Star Trek.. happening all at once, in a coherent storyline. For the most part, the writers (who are these gods?) manage to tie a whole bunch of ridiculously contrived continuities from the creators into something much more coherent than it originally was. It might slip past you if you don't care about the plot or aren't paying enough attention, but seriously, this game turns BAD (with a capital B!) episodes from the TV shows into something that makes sense and can actually form a long story that ties in with others. Play it for the episodes and very little else, and you'll find a fanfiction-style work that ties things together with amazing detail.My only real complaint is that literally nobody plays the PVP anymore, as far as I can tell. Want to use that amazing new ship you bought for more than your own personal masturbation in the latest quest line to be released? Well, tough. Apparently enough people ruined it early in the lifecycle of the game that you just can't find anyone to play with anymore. The PVE Queues the game has, where everyone defends against the Borg or whatnot, are full 24/7, and an excellent way to level (you can get 90% to the level cap within 12 hours if you just keep running them!). However, the PVP queues are at zero, zero, zero, zero, zero for every match type, all day and all night, with little to no flukes where there are suddenly more people in them. There's just nothing. I really wanted to try PVP even if it sucked, but I guess it's back to living through some pretty interesting Star Trek episodes for me. :) Which is both a blessing and a curse, as is most of this game.Accept STO as the flawed piece of semi-trash that it is, and you'll find plenty of treasures within, it just might be best to wait for enjoying them until you're in the mood to appreciate something that might not be perfect.",Tue Jan 14 10:53:27 EET 2020,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

It is not, however, a good Star Trek game.  For me, the main draw of Star Trek isn't so much the science fiction, which let's face it, is on the silly side.  It is the characters, the dynamics between the crew that makes it interesting.  In-game, however, crew members are treated as little more than equipment, so that personal connection is gone.  You gain the ability to customize your officers however you want, true, but you lose what makes them characters.Another problem of the game is the randomly generated sidequests.  Sure, it's fun to pretend that you are the star of your own Star Trek show, routinely investigating strange species, artifacts, and negative space wedgies, but the mad-lib style of quest generation means that after a while, all these quests seem to blur together.  So aside from the story quests - which are well done, by the way - none of the other content is memorable.The saving grace for these sidequests is the Foundry, which allows users to create their own quests and stories.  Sturgeon's Law is in full effect here; 90% of the custom content is lackluster, but the other 10% makes it worthwhile.While the game has problems that prevent it from being truly great, I would still recommend it for MMO gamers.  The universe feels big, the ship-to-ship combat is frantic but tactical (although sometimes you fight with the UI more than the enemy), and the amount of reference to the Star Trek shows can make Star Trek enthusiasts giddy.  If these sound exciting, that this is the game for you.",Fri Oct 22 10:28:08 EEST 2021,36632203-f738-4537-9a19-0a723bfe371a

It consists of 6 missions if you choose to create a character from the Starfleet of the 23rd century, and also about 4 other missions towards the middle of the game whereby you become a Temporal Agent.The storyline takes you to various different locations and various timelines, most notably: the JJ Abrams Timeline (or the Kelvinverse) where the U.S.S Kelvin was destroyed in battle (presumably). In this timeline, you assist the U.S.S Yorktown against Na'Kuhl Raiders who are trying to destroy the timeline hence creating a weapon against the Federation. There are several ships added in his DLC, all of which, however, cost REAL MONEY. I have to say, however, that they are very unique and powerful although I am surprised at the lack of a Kelvin Timeline Constitution Class (T6). The DLC itself feels and looks very much like the TOS sounds and graphics I wanted but does not give me the option to change to the 2410 style later on when the TOS effects seemed to get slightly annoying, Other than this, it felt almost empty as the storyline ended abruptly. I feel that more could have been added to improve e experience.",Tue Dec 29 10:02:32 EET 2020,fc196f94-b366-4378-815a-62b874de0ec2

and this whole process will cost you hundreds of dollars in real life money. now imagine you have to upgrade the warpcore, engine, deflector, shield of your ship and now even imagine you have 50 ships all with different gear. this will cost you thousands of dollar just to upgrade all your old stuff that you have already aquired and paid with real money. they let you pay again and again and again your stuff that you have already bought. sto is not worth the insane high costs, its maybe worth 10 bucks per month at all. you could fill a 1tb drive full with games for the money sto wants from you. i had a little trick i have used to avoid the insane high costs in form of real money. i had in the end 27 chars and 20 alts all level 50 that i have used to farm ec, dilithium, commodities, contraband and i was a heavy multibox user. because of this little trick i could aquire everything in the game, i had everything and all ships you could get. this means i have started sometimes up to 10 game clients and i was logged in with 10 different accounts at once. i did cycle though all 47 chars to get all the doffjobs done on all of my chars. i mainly used the refugee, prisoner, officer doff exchange assignments to get more very rare and rare doffs and sell them on the exchange. all i did was switch between the game windows and do doff assignments for doffs, contraband and commodities or i did path to 2409 or did mine dilithium with my 47 chars or did the cristalline entity event and idled with 10 chars at the startpoint lol. sometimes i have played more than 18 hours per weekend day! i made trillions of ec and millions of dilithium(trade 5 contraband for 2000 dil ore every 4 hours with my 20 alts chars plus 1 main char). i did not pay a dime for the new greed rising extension, i have farmed over 2,5 million dilithium and traded it for zen and bought the dr pack ingame for 12,5k zen. i was very dissapointed by the delta rising pack, the new t6 ship are ugly beyond imagination, the stats of the ships are horrible, everything is broken in delta rising nothing works. i couldnt even login more due to crashes and server timeout and game freezes every few minutes. sto has no beta testers, we the endgame customers are the alpha and beta testers. i said to myself enough is enough, screw that. i have deinstalled sto and sold my main account. i will never again play a mmo or sto. i bought now battlefield 4 with premium and all unlocks. now i play maybe every 2 or 3 days bf4 for 2 or 3 hours per day. i only play bf4 if i really have the time and nothing else to do. i have also no monthly followup costs like in sto. i bought bf4 once and have never again to pay anything and bf4 is now 99% gameplay and fun and only 1% grinding and for the first time in 3 years i have seen a real working game support, thanks for that. now after my horrible sto experience my whole life has changed to a very good life, i have now more sleep, more energy, more money, more time, more friends, more sun, more of everything, im so glad i stopped playing sto.",Thu Feb 04 05:10:33 EET 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

It's not the subtle intergallactic diplomacy styling of the TV shows; Star Trek Online takes more after the movies with more action and more conflict.This isn't a bad thing, the space combat has become more and more satisfying over the years and the complexity of situations improve every mission.The ground combat has improved enough to be fine, but isn't the most enjoyable part of the game. This is where the crew you bring on missions are helpful; they balance a lot of the quirks out and allow for some customization. In reality, if you take ground combat partially seriously it's alright and there's no real penalty for wiping on mission so the problems are ignorable.Since the game has been around for a few years, the ships available are many and wonderful. If you wanted to fly ships from the Dominion War perfect! Want to play a period-specific Enterprise from earlier shows and movies? They have that too.

The game contains a lot of elements I enjoy, lacks in a few areas, but mostly is a great game! I tend to take my time, with my own method of how I play the game, making logs for every mission I do. Like an actual Starfleet Officer would do, as far as I know. The whole Star Trek franchise is my 3rd favorite (set of) show(s). The games story throws me off, the Federation allied or has a peace treaty with both the Klingons and the Romulans, I don't know why they are considered enemies. Especially when the 3 sides that you can be on, don't really fight one another. I haven't gotten much into the campaign yet to really know and understand the story, but as far as I can tell, I just enjoy being able to be a Starfleet Officer and having my own ship, and of course making my own logs.Issues I have with this game:1. You can't customize your ship fully. You can, somewhat, but I wish there was a more detailed way to modify your ship.2. You can't change your first officers information. This kind of bugged me, I wish I could change my first officers details just as I can change my first officers appearance, but the game doesn't allow it.3. You can't train your officers in like a holodeck program, which I wish you could build your own training programs and have access to a holodeck program. That way you can train your officers and even earn experience for yourself, maybe?4. You have to buy a lot of things with no free way really to earn a few Zen coins every now and then.Other than the issues I have with the game, the game is really fun and enjoyable! Even for a MMO. Although having it a single player game would have been cooler, that way they probably would of payed attention to how you build your ship, or design your character, and all of that rather than focusing on how the PVP system will work. Like with most MMO's, you can't really summarize the story without going through most of the game. So I can't summarize the story for this game.",Wed Oct 28 07:48:34 EET 2020,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

It has drastically changed over time, for the most part not positive.First of all, in my opinion, this game has little in common with the spirit of the original Star Trek series and films.It is a standard MMORPG on a generic engine that happens to be in a cartoonish colored version of the Star Trek Universe. You mainly run/fly around click on static dialogs and kill millions of enemies. SpaceAs the game reaches its 5th anniversary, Cryptic's Star Trek Online universe grew to an acceptable size. Unfortunately it is not an unlimited and contigous space. Instead this overall 2D universe is devided into 3D ""Sector Blocks"" (maps) with unpassable hard borders, so that you are hopping from one block to another beiing shown a loading screen as you are travaling through it.In addition, every map gets instanced, if a certain player limit (i tthink 20-40 players) is reached, so that you never will experience the massiveness of MMORPG.GroundI'll skip the ground part. I think, it does not differ much from every other game of this kind except that heavy ""instancing"" and ""zoning"".Revenue ModelIn theory, the Free to Play acccess grants access to the whole content, but you'll be disapointed rapidly. In fact the free access is restricted to storyline, all areas and basic equipment and few basic ships. Everything else has to be either bought or exchanged/upgraded in exchange for diverse in-game currencies. It is possible to earn them, but it is an endless, monotonous, boring and repetitive ""grinding"" and Cryptic did set a limit for a daily income of the main currency called refined dillithium, You are forced to came back and login every day to earn it and even then you will be always short of it. Or simply buy them for real money.Then you have the c-store where you can buy expansion packs, items, most ships and ""services"" which expand your account with real money or exchanges refined dillithium.Furthermore Cryptic invented a lottery/ casino system for special items and ships packed in boxes with unpublished win chances, but they are told to be very, very small. You can participate with using real money among others and can't be sure to ever win.With the latest Expansion ""Delta Rising"" the costs for high-rank equipment increased drastically. And you badly need it to successfully participate in the end-game elite content, where practically the only important ability is, to deal the most damage per second (dps) to the enemy.ConclusionSo if you don't want to stuck at easy difficulty in pre-endgame state, the game ends up being either a second job/chore to earn all currencies/materials/marks/... or a serious cash investment for virtual stuff and Cryptic's casino with equivalent nofun-factor.",Sat Oct 09 01:25:03 EEST 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

Even on Klingon side, after I smoked a Chimera dreadnaught (one of the biggest boats out there) in a B'rel Bird of Prey (the starter ship) I felt very much like I'd seen everything there was to see here.Playing Federation, on the other hand, was just insultingly silly.  Going from the academy to the captain's chair in the space of an afternoon, in the company of your bubbleheaded teenybopper classmates who all seem to think they're going to be captains too sometime soon, just wrecks all suspension of disbelief.  As does taking an old clunker of a training ship out, running into a Borg cube, and NOT getting owned in five seconds.  Sorry, I don't see how I'm supposed to take that seriously as either a Trek fan or a newcomer just looking to blow stuff up in space.A few very notable nice touches, though the memorial to the Star Trek actors and crew who have passed away was both touching and depressing (the list of names is really, really long...).

Everything that can be bought can be earned in game if you bother to look into it. Paying obscene amounts of money dulls out the game and makes it unplayable after a rather short curve. The community (with exception to the Starfleet faction; unconfirmed with the Original Series factions, I have not yet played deeply with them) is astounding and helpful, even at times being more helpful than gamemasters, though not extremely often. The dev team is wonderful, one of the best I've seen.Everything worth owning encourages you to play with a fleet or armada. The game itself is emersive and flexible to play styles, and many portions are done either alone or with a group if you take a minute to find one. The scaling difficulty means you can play anything any time and join your pals when it suits you.I'll admit, if you have/had a character who was between level 45 and 50 before the massive refit a long while back, the grind is tedious at times to build the crafting skills without help. The dev team did a fair job making up for a lot of that. You can communicate with people or guilds from other games by Perfect world using the default chat, meaning if you want to go play Neverwinter, you can chat up your fleet or vis versa. The first 50 levels are over rather quickly, especially if you aren't dunking your head in plasma coolant on Earth Space Dock (which I might add is the most immature region in the game), once you get past them you'll start exploring most or all of the new content. Any mission or quest task you don't want to play you can skip as long as you're properly leveled and provided it isn't also a campaign tree, which begin to be available after achieving level 50.I'd give the game a 9/10 average.And to finish, who doesn't like blowing stuff up on a massive scale with death rays and proto cannons?",Mon Sep 07 10:05:29 EEST 2020,fc196f94-b366-4378-815a-62b874de0ec2

I had teamed up with three friends who had also just started to play as well.  We got the third wave of 7 Federation vessels before it was to much.  I spent the majority of the this space battle trying to keep pointed at a vessel to get the most of my weapons to fire at 1 target.  Yes I had my cannons/turrent/torpedos on repeat fire, no the enemy didn't go down easily.  I had to keep moving otherwise turning was stupid slow.  Then I had to mitigate my shields, coordinate with my teammates on which targets we were trying to take down, use my evasive maneuvers, and keep eyes on the enemy.  This is a lot to throw on to me as a new player.  There was nothing fun at dying that much in the first for real space battle.  The graphics were fine.  The dialog was fine.  The WOWesk game play was fine.  I stomach through a lot to get to that first battle and it taught me a valuable lesson.  Star Trek online is not for me because of it's space battle system.  Heck, take out the space battle system and Star Trek online is not for me because the rest of the game was fine.  Not good, not moderate, just fine.  Passable in the sense that I forsee it lasting at least another 5 years off the backs truly devoted to this special type of torturous game play.

Buut, time changes perspectives, and MMOs start to become unwieldy and grindy. From the reputatiojn system to the admiralty system to the various skill systems, the entire game is designed to cause you to spend as much time as posssible... managing skill points and inventory. I'm sure there are many people who consider this to be fun, but for me it has gotten quite tedious and has limited my ability to enjoy the gameplay. In addition, PvP is dead, if you want PvP, go somewhere else, it's all PvE in STO. If you like that, then great.I honestly started playing it because I was interested to see what they were doing with the prime universe. There's some great stuff in there, especially the New Romulus stuff. But I got to a point where I had to grind ceaselessly in order to unlock more missions and I stopped caring. Too much grinding for far too little reward. But that's the nature of F2P, hey? I don't doubt that it works, STO is going strong and is always full of people.

What i would do to make the game a little better is, make the 'buildup' to the training room (tutorial) shorter, make the tutorials a bit more realistic to get players more immersed into the game, EG: ""Move your mouse over the enemy and click to shoot them"" (or something like that) could become ""Aim at the enemy, and pull the trigger to fire (M1 default)""I would also add a mechanic where, if the player does manage to fire at an enemy, there is a chance that the gun would miss, due to bullet spread, or if its a laser type of weapon, then due to laser distortion.I would also make small improvements, like improving some animations in the game, like lip syncing, or in cutscenes, make the movements more fluid, because in some of the cutcenes the movement of the characters look a bit robotic.",Thu Aug 26 03:29:30 EEST 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

STO allows you to play as a lot of Star Trek races and use a variety of ships for free, but, annoyingly, it doesn't let you 'refit' ships directly for late-game play when you're up against the tougher enemies. Instead, you have to BUY (or, do LOTS and LOTS of grinding for) individual upgraded versions of ships, or some ships that are ONLY for late game play. The combat is okay but very repetitive and cares more about getting you to waste money on better gear than actually being fun. Sure, it feels like Star Trek, but at the same time either makes crap up outta nowhere or even completely defies canon, even though it's supposed to NOT be an alternate universe... Good job, guys...To make matters worse, the clothing and posture options are very frequently restricted by gender(every skirt, numerous tops, etc.) even though Star Trek is intended to promote full gender equality, and the TV show actually shows guys wearing skirts and skimpy tops and all those female-only(in STO) items and vice versa at times. Worf was even once told he looks good in a dress! Another point I'd like to make is that for a 'free to play' game, there is a TON, a TON of grinding and paywall nonsense; and many of it is even dependant on GAMBLING real money for a slim chance at getting something decent, while almost every time, you'll be getting garbage-equivalent. In conclusion, the voice acting is often terrible(or not even there, so you need to read dialogue...), many species cost money, ANY SHIP outside a select few 'free' ones(which are useless outside the early game) are expensive(from 25 to 250 dollars!)(not exaggerating), it violates canon on many occasions, it provides terrible fan service constantly, your character is frequently given false choices that all have THE SAME result, the story is lazy, the animations are awful, the gameplay is gimmicky at best, the whole game is constantly getting glitches that need patching, and perhaps most importantly, the so-called role-playing game is constantly taking away your chance to alter the course of events and doesn't make you feel like your character actually matters to the plot at all; in essence, it is a (bad) story 'happening around you'. Summary:Positive aspects: Star Trek -like appearance. Decent space combat. Good sound effects. Multiplayer is available. Good graphics(terrible animations)Negative aspects: Too many to count; some of the bad ones that came to mind this particular day are written above.",Mon Jul 05 00:48:18 EEST 2021,fc196f94-b366-4378-815a-62b874de0ec2

Some Pros:- Beautiful vistas- Engaging Ship-to-Ship combat- extensive content, with no need to spend real money in the cash shop- active community- Missions can be skipped if high enough level- XP is easy to earn, via Duty Officer Assignments, which allow you to set up ""over night"" missions for experience and resource gain.- Well-Balanced gameplay and PVP combat.Some Cons:- Dilithium (used to buy ZEN coins for cash shop) rates are extremely high... 120-130 Dilithium = 1 ZEN Coin = $0.01 USD- Away Missions seem to take forever, and aren't nearly as engaging as the Space Combat.- For a game that takes place during a time of war, there isn't a lot of war going on... not even between players of opposing factions. A PvP Territory Control Wargame would easily fix this, and while there are unofficial versions made by fans, I'd rather have one that doesn't require me to keep track of updates on another, third-party website.- Fleets (Guilds) are difficult to get up and running when you're only a few members strong. Either pray you have a lot of friends, with lots of friends, or get ready to spend real cash on getting your fleet up and running properly.",Sun Oct 04 11:05:54 EEST 2020,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

But the hilarious dichotomy between playing as the peace-loving Federation and the fact your throat is raw from screaming at your bridge officers to fire all the torpedoes aside the space combat is a fantastic amount of fun! Sure the difficulty spike post lvl 50 will have you choking on your own bile and other bodily fluids but... actually no that's about it. Good luck! It's totally possible to push past that barrier, but I won't lie it's difficult and if you do that's when you hit the real paywall.And now would be a good time to mention what you'll find in everybody else's negative reviews. They're right. Not little bits here and there. All of it. They nickel and dime you for every little thing. New characters, new bridge officers, duty officers, removal of cash limit, costumes, the benefits of the lifetime membership which you have to wait to unlock incrementally after you buy it, and last but literally the most important thing in a game about space: spaceships! Pay to Win? What? That's not a question. It's just rhetorical. Find your nearest STO player in real life. Chances are they don't do drugs! Because of instead of giving their money to a drug dealer they gave it to STO! ...I just ...I feel this fits somewhere in a morally grey area of what ends up being worse and the answer is ALWAYS zone chat. *shudders*Anything else you find in negative reviews? Like I said: totally true. Grind? Horrible. Fun? Absa-freakin-lutely. The combat is fun. Figuring out what works is fun. Working on your ship(s) is fun. Heck testing out your ships is the REALLY fun part. Shenanigans with your fleet is FUN. Teasing the randoms you meet in queued missions while you silently remember what you used to be is FUN. When the devs break the game after every update and you just keep finding things for like a week or more afterwards? Aggravating. But fun to complain about with your fleet members.I've gotten through this entire review really without mentioning that it's Star Trek. Because I do believe the gameplay stands up on it's own. Especially considering how old the engine for this game is. And that Star Trek veneer over this whole thing really sells it. It bleeds Star Trek, especially in the earlier campaigns. The more you look and know about the shows the more references and detail you see and in a way it makes the game more vibrant.So whatever half of this review appeals to you the most, like it hate it whatever, go for it.

The graphics are a little choppy and outdated, even on maximum settings it is not the greatest BUT it is also by no means the worst and you will quickly adjust to it and even forget about it due to the immersive and interesting nature of the Universe and the plotlines unless, of course, you are one of those people that cannot find joy in a game unless it is using the most recent graphic technology. The storylines are interesting, there are a myriad of options and a great deal of depth to the game when it comes to improving your ship, outfitting it with new equipment, training your officers, dispatching them on missions and so forth. The customisation for your ship and captain/officer uniforms are expansive and very detailled. Most of them do not require Zen to purchase.There is a LOT of complaining regarding this game when it comes to the lockboxes and Zen purchases. It is worth saying that there is absolutely NO need to purchase ANYTHING in order to experience and enjoy this game to the full unless you are an impatient person who objects to having to put some EFFORT in to the game in order to reap the best rewards. So, if you want to get the best things quickly and zerg your way through everything without having to actually work for it like some over priveliged snowflake then be prepared to pony up some cash or have your self indulgent whine about it and go play something else that better fulfills your need for instant gratification. However, if you appreciate rewards gained for time and effort leading to an actual feeling of ACHIEVEMENT when you finally get that top tier ship you always wanted then you won't have any problems with this game. In any case, you will be given a new ship of a type of your choosing every 10 levels and most things available via Zen can actually be purchased via the Exchange (Star Trek's version of the Auction House). There is NO NEED at any point EVER to open the many, many lockboxes you will be given or pick up during your gameplay unless you want to.** I did have one issue with Crytic when I first started up that is worth a special note! ** Basically their website refused to accept my card details when I tried to subscribe and so after two attempts I ended up subbing via Paypal. Now, the two attempts in which I tried to use my card actually resulted in Cryptic putting two ""hold"" transactions on my bank account for Â£1 each. Not a lot of money and not a problem for me financially, but it was unauthorised and without my being notified in any way, thus I had a huge problem with it! I contacted their customer support via email and received a response within 2hrs in which I was informed that this is standard procedure and their way of checking that the card details are, in fact, valid. They stated the money would be returned to me in 10 WORKING days, and it was. In fact it was never actually taken from my account. I confirmed with my bank directly that this was the case as I actually tried to reclaim the money at first thinking this was some sort of scam and they informed me they could not reverse the transactions as unauthorised until the money had actually been withdrawn by Cryptic, however the funds reappeared at the end of the 10 working day time frame. So, if this happens to you just bear in mind that despite the fact there is NOTHING on their subscription pages informing you this will happen, it will likely happen unless you have made a purchase with them before so don't panic like I did! They really should make it clear to customers that this is the case though as I was VERY angry when I noticed the two unauthorised transactions on my account and had my bank waiting to open a fraud case against Cryptic as they never informed me of this and I did not consent to it at any point.

I loved this game for a long time, too.What I'm not a fan of, is the way things on this have turned recently within STO. The atmosphere of the game is wrong. When I first started playing, it was a happy, very lore-friendly place filed with lots of people trying to get their way into the TV screen we all watched our first episodes on. Recently, the lay of the land has become confusing. To say you have to grind a lot is the understatement of the milenium. EVERYTHING is a grind now, unless you want to pay for it. It has also become increasingly apparent that PWE is searching for money: In-game purchases are fine, but when you give us 3 new ships and 10 new costumes every other week, it gets ridiculous. I think one of the things I have been experiencing serves as a perfect explination. The game only launches on safe mode. In the time that this bug began to now, I count at least 19 new ships that have been added to the game (not including fleet model ships). The new way of grinding is... well, bad. Horrendous. An abomination. A lot of the new grinds require vast sums of dilithium, which is hard to farm for, and is quantity capped at 8000 units a day, which is a penny in the well of what you'll actually need. Now, dilitium is hard to farm for, but guess what PWE sells. Zen. Guess what you can by dilithium for, kiddies. Zen. All in all, this game is very good. I wouldn't have spent so much time on it otherwise, but I'm terrified that this will turn into Guitar Hero. A good game, a great idea, but driven into the ground harder than a Mack truck hitting a freight train because they produced too much new content too fast, and people got sick of it. Also: when you advertise an upgrade to your existing tier 5 ships to make them ""tier 5u"" ships, make them equal to the tier 6 ships. The imbalance is ridiculous. I have top-tier gear on my odyssey (including your $5 upgrade). It can't keep pace with anything on tier 6, and thats not okay.

The tutorial sticks you with skills and abilities you may not want and doesnt even let you respecialize to your own liking. You have to buy a token which you can obtain without spending actual money, but it'll take weeks of grinding for Dilithium Crystals just to afford it. My overall rating on this bug-ridden distaster is a 2 out of 5. It seems Cryptic has lost its sense of gaming and just dove for the players' wallets.

In the late game, due to this being a 7 year old MMO, the feature creep has made it such that these things matter far less than your ship's build and ancillary power-ups. However, you can play all of the game's ample and fun story missions without ever getting into the endgame and if you enjoy crunch, there is a lot of fun to be had in creating an amazing ship build and earning a variety of crew skills, captain skills, reputation, and ship unlocks that take your prowess even further. This is further assisted by an interesting crafting system and fleet mechanics that make getting the ""perfect"" build achievable and fun - until they add a new set of toys to purchase and the process starts again.There is a lot to like about how this game's systems compliment one another and how it provides a great experience for free players while it also gives significant, but not overwhelming, advantage to the game's whales - especially as the more advanced players tend to play in the highest difficulty settings that are aimed at challenging those few players who have achieved ridiculously OP builds.Having said that, the game is aging and it definitely shows in the lackluster visuals and some game design choices that were once acceptable but are less than ideal in modern games (for example, they will often pause gameplay to have characters share dialogue instead of having them talk to you while you play - that makes sense sometimes because not all exposition occurs during action, but this actually happens in the middle of fights sometimes or immediately before or after them. My guess is that it is just an old engine that has events built based only on mission objective order and/or they get too many errors with sound prioritization. Finally, the ground game has always been water garbage and they never managed to fix it. They should have gutted it and replaced the ground game with a shooter because phasers are incredibly powerful in this IP's lore and almost all races should be taken down by one shot -  even with armor once their shields are depleted. Instead, the ground game is just really bad MMO design with a bunch of mechanics that don't really matter. I literally put Netflix on the other screen during ground levels and just pound buttons until I kill things or die. I can pay attention and be more successful, but not enough for it to matter. Still, at this point it is a lesson to learn for the next game - and wouldn't that be lovely. I'd be so excited if they announced they were working on a sequel with a modern game engine, modern game design, and the ground game being completely redesigned as a cover-shooter with frequent puzzles and story. I doubt this will happen though as the game's updates over the years tend to indicate that they are engineer light. ",Tue Feb 09 15:33:02 EET 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

While I do continue to play it, it has a few issues that are worth mentioning to anyone considering trying out this game.-Firstly, the game has a decent Star-Trek story continuing after the destruction of Romulus that ocurred in the 2009 Star Trek movie, and takes place in the ""Prime"" (AKA the same timeline as TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT, and now DSC) and not the new movies' ""Kelvin"" timeline (Although it is mentioned and lockbox ships of Kelvin timeline starships are present). -Secondly, once you reach level 50, you're introduced to the end-game, although the max level is 60. The end-game consists of reputation grinding and essentially outfitting your ship and captain to perform better in ground or space combat. This is where one of the problems I mentioned earlier comes in, the only real way to play this game is DPS. There is no ""MMO-Trinity"" style of gameplay, well, on paper there is but not in actuallity. While there are 3 career paths (Tactical - DPS, Science - Control/Healer, Engineer - Tank/Pets), DPS is king, and power-creep is to the point of where one high level ship can destroy several borg tactical cubes and a transwarp gateway in ISA (Infected Space Elite - Space Queued Instance), in about 3-5 minutes, which has only gotten shorter over the years. -Going off of the DPS problem mentioned earlier, the power-creep essentially means that PvP in this game, is dead, and has been dead ever since around 2012. Therefore, if you want to PvP, know that it will be near impossible to find a game, and if you do, you will most likely get hit by a player who uncloaks and alpha-strikes you into oblivion within 3 seconds. -The game isn't ""Pay-To-Win"" per say, it's more ""Pay-To-Get-X-Faster"", as everything, even stuff in the cash shop, can be acquired for free (Through the Dilithium exchange, which allows you to convert Dilithium, a time gated currency you earn, into zen, the premium cash currency, by ""buying"" it from other players who ""sell"" their zen for dilithium). As such, the exchange is player-driven and the price raises/lowers as the need for dilithium grows/wanes (Basically if an event rewards a ton of dilithium, exchange prices go up, if a crafting event or phoenix box run comes, dilithium is needed so the price goes down). However, getting zen this way takes quite a while, and if you don't have more than the basic 3 character slots, with high level characters, then you will grind at an abyssmal rate, although, as a guy that has several characters, it's still a grind, although possible to manage 100 zen per day (most ships cost 2,000-3,000). Even the lockbox ships are available for free as well, as most players sell them on the EC Exchange, with EC being the ""gold"" of the game that you earn fairly easilly. The catch is lockbox ships go for at least 20,000,000 ec (those being the old T5 ships from 4-5 years ago, new ones go for 150,000,000+), and this amount means you'll be grinding ec from either crafting, Tour The Galaxy (Mission that rewards ec daily), or other means, and this method will still take around a month or 2 to earn said ship. -The Canon and Lore, don't even get me started. If you expect to find a ""Canon"" - esque Star Trek game, this is not for you. This is a game where captains of the Federation, Klingon Empire, and New Romulan Republic all fly whatever ship they want, except ships from each other's faction. For example, we can have a human or klingon pilotting a ""salvaged"" Jem-Hadar Dreadnaught, or a ""Captured"" Voth Dreadnaught, or ""Recovered"" Kelvin Timeline Dreadnaught. My point is, the game doesn't really care for being lore-friendly, or canon, outside of the story-missions. Although from a technical standpoint I suppose having so many admiral rank captains running around is also not lore-friendly, but necessary for the whole MMO thing to work, so in some sense, I can understand this.-The game can be fun at times, but at least for me, I get burned out every so often, and leave for a couple months, only to come back later.Ok, so if you don't mind those issues, then you may like this game, if you take issue with grinding, or the Star Trek Canon being somewhat violated, then steer clear from this game, and find another Star Trek game (I'd recommend Stellaris with the New Horizons Mod, or Bridge Commander if you can find it).Oh and if you do decide to play, here are a few tips-Make sure to get the free event ships and stuff, even if you don't fly them, admiralty cards come from them-Join a fleet (guild), they provide access to high-end gear-If you want to make dilithium fast, try going to a battlezone and using admiralty missions-If you want to make EC fast, do tour the galaxy as much as possible with high speed warp cores/engines. Also sell lootbox/lockbox keys on the exchange for EC, they go for 4 mil each at the time of writing thisOther than that, have fun if you decide to stay and play, and if this isn't your cup of tea, there are other star trek games / mods out there, some of which you may find more enjoyable. This game still gets a mixed from me though.",Thu Nov 25 10:54:16 EET 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

From what I've gathered is the Delta Update broke pretty much everything that wasn't broken and made what already was much worse. PVP is dead. Ship balance is all ♥♥♥♥ed up end-game. Before Tier 5 was the best, they were expensive but it made sense for them to be. Tier 6 however, ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. From what I've gathered the pilot spec on a ship with a tank build is broken as all hell in PVP. The game is loosely Pay-to-Win, I say loosely because you go through a process to get zen coins which are needed to buy top tier items, but the process is painfully slow and on a single accout, you'll never see a profit. It takes up two two months across multiple accounts just to make enough Zen to buy a tier 6 ship. Constant lag spikes and random rubber-banding that shows no sign of being fixed anytime soon.Ground combat is awful, hands down one of the worst I've ever seen. Again, no sign's of that changing any time soon. Many of the planets are bland and boring with no point behind being able to go to them. Worst contender is Andoria, outside of what I think is melee PVP, there's nothing there. No Top tier melee shops, no nothing. No one ever goes there. Upgrading your gear seems to make game shops pointless, at least to me. Why waste 5,000 EC on a plasma array when you can make a better one for free?.Upgrading later on can be extremely slow. Only 3% of the game is voiced, which is fine if it wasn't.. All over the place? You could be having a scripted conversation with your First officer, they have a voice that covers the first three lines of the script then the rest of the paragraph has no voice over, it's just odd is all. All that is forgiveable if it wasn't for my last point, THE GAME IS BUSTED!!. For many users the game wont even load up anymore. It's always crashing, can't even get to log-in screen without it crashing, there are no long-term fixes. Re-starting the game only works a few times, after that not even Verifiying files or re-installing the game will fix it. In short, this game was once a great game, then delta came along and ruined it all. If I was in charge, delta would of been a update that revamps ground combat, squash bugs and glitches, offered up more Voice-over and improved PVP.",Thu Dec 09 11:18:11 EET 2021,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

Some people in this game have 15+ Alts who do nothing but grind all day and stroke their ego. Very grindy =( especially with Gear that has so much RNG attached to it.- PVP is abvandoned. You need to invest hundreds of dollars to PVP.- PVE is a DPS race. You need to invest a lot of time to grind out gear for obscure game breaking exploits.- Ground combat was abandoned.

I will not suggest against playing it, however I will suggest against playing only the story content and leaving it at that.If you treat STO like an MMO you will get burned out. and get throw threw the mud, it will destroy you as a person and you will end up hating yourself for it. The microtransactions in this game are greedy, and the community is a mix between ignorance and apathy when it comes to this.Also, anything negative about sto the game gets vote brigaded by the community. I Have witnessed this first hand on many occasions though the years as all that's left in the community are the most dedicated, most worn players that will lie cheat and deceive you that STO is a land of milk and honey, when all of that milk and honey dried up around the time of Delta Rising - and the players loved it.",Wed Jan 12 18:57:19 EET 2022,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

Hostages are taken at a conviently shaped building that has been broken into, and being the only security guard working for this corporation, you are tasked with breaking into the broken into facility. Once inside, you're asked politely to save the hostages and \""get the hell on with it\"" so the robocops can bust a cap in the terrorist's augmented behinds. It's then revealed you are augemented but no one in the building is, because they're anti-technology bandits who simply used magic to get inside and past all the security systems (Turrets and poison gas traps) which leads me to believe that augementation in the first place is completely pointless as normal humans seem to be the real winners of the game.

The story is intriguing and it has that little something that keeps you going through it. They reward very good loot(some of them) when you replay them at max level, which is 60. Yes, you can replay almost every episode(missions). New episodes are added regularly. The story captures the feel of the Star Trek universe pretty well.2. The combat is good at the start, but it can get boring if you don't have a good build. There are many builds out there and there is one for you for sure. Ground combat is not the best, but not the worst either. IMPORTANT!  The game relies on DPS a lot. It is possible to be a healer/tank, but you won't influence the battles that much.3. The game is massive. Sector Space is huge with a lot of Systems including Sol System, Qo'Nos, DS9, Drozana Station and the new Delta Quadrant is awesome. There are tons of things to do in the game, from crafting to grinding Energy Credits(in-game currency) to building your Fleet Space Station and other Fleet buildings. 4. One of the best things with this game is that you can get Zen(the most important currency) in two ways:a. Buy Zen with money. ORb. Grind Dilithium, which is made from quite a lot of activities in-game. There is a Dilithium exchange market controlled entirely by players like a stock market or a bank. You buy Zen for Dilithium or vice-versa. That makes Dilithium a very important currency. You are capped at making 8.000 dilithium per day per character though. But you can make other characters and transfer the dilithium to the character you want. Zen is the only currency account-wide.",Thu Mar 25 08:14:54 EET 2021,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

It has only one security guard and appears to be the target of terrorism on a global scale. Hostages are taken at a conviently shaped building that has been broken into, and being the only security guard working for this corporation, you are tasked with breaking into the broken into facility. Once inside, you're asked politely to save the hostages and \""get the hell on with it\"" so the robocops can bust a cap in the terrorist's augmented behinds. It's then revealed you are augemented but no one in the building is, because they're anti-technology bandits who simply used magic to get inside and past all the security systems (Turrets and poison gas traps) which leads me to believe that augementation in the first place is completely pointless as normal humans seem to be the real winners of the game.

I will leave in most of my original 'first impressions' review too. NOTE: I have changed my opinion on some areas. Updated bits at the bottom. Essentially, be prepaired to pay real money at the higher levels, and don't buy anyhting less than a T6 ship because it's a waste of money - and in the future expect to pay again, and again as they release increasingly high-level content and your current ship won't be able to do it.---original first impressions-----TL;DR: It's FREE, so give it a go if you're even slightly into Trek. IT's surprisingly good, and the paid for store items are good value for what you get. one of the better PVE MMO's I've ever played.(52 hours played at this point)  I was immediately surprised by how much detail the game makers have gone into in terms of creating a very 'Star Trek' feel to the game, and successfully translating a TV/Film franchise to not only a computer game, but a (relatively) free-roaming MMO.All the Trek bits aside, the game itself plays nicely, the interface on the ground I found a tiny bit clunky, but I adapted fairly quicky and there's certainly a lot of scope for customisation and individual play styles. The ground game reminds me a lot of a party-rpg style game because you have your away team of NPC crew members, all of whom have skills and equipment that you can customise and level up, so it's mostly about creating a 'team' that works well rather than just making one character that can do everything.The space combat is where the game shines in many ways. It's a healthy mix of tactical positioning and phaser-blasting, and the control system is nicely done. Combat is well paced and feels solid, though there are other things to do in space other than shoot stuff.The mission system is robust and fairly varied, with good stories and they feel very much like episodes in a TV series for the most part. There's a lot of repeatable missions and side missions as you'd expect from a MMO. There's a welcome mix of mini-games and small puzzle-solving elements to many of the missions which add some variety.The game is still being actively developed with expansions and content, there seems to be events very frequently that get you bonuses or involve special storylines, the community is active and the players seem on the whole a good bunch of people.My major complaint is that it's too easy (even on the hardest setting). I'm not a power gamer and I wouldn't consider myself to be any sort of expert or anything, but it's basically impossible to fail any mission. There's no way that I've found of losing anything, there's no possiblity of any of your main bridge crew dying, your ship can never be destroyed. If you get 'killed' or blown up on a mission you just repawn (the mission doesn't even reset to the start).The up-sde of this is that it actually adds to the feeling of Trek universe (where there's always a way out even when crew seemingly dies, etc.).So that's it really.-----end original------Latest feeling:Generally, what I said still stands. However there are some important considerations to make. The PVE space game gets less tactical as you get higher up and as usual the DPS-heavy options are infinitely better than any other play-style. Which is sad since at lower levels there's quite a lot of tactics involved and it's viable playing other roles. At lv50+ it's just ""activate all the special abilities and keep firing"", I spend more time watching the cooldown timers on my hotbar than I do the actual 'ships-in-space' bit. Ironically the ground-game has levelled perfectly and remained consitent throughout.The game ***IS*** Pay-to-win. Up to lv50 you can do fine on the 'free' version, although I did make some (very optional and fun) purchases from the C-store because I wanted to support a game I enjoyed. I purchased a couple of ships and a few other things, spending around £40 or so - for me, the purchase price of a good game. My plan was to make a small (£5-£10)purchase every month or so as I played or les frequent larger ones (the subscription options don't offer much IMO, but there's plenty you can buy).When I hit lv51 I found my ship (which cost me £25+ which I was using since I didn't like the equivalent-in-power free ones) suddenly struggling. It seems to me that to play in a comfortable way after lv50 you really need to pay for a Tier 6 ship - therefore it's pay-to-win since you can't realistically do all the content avaialble without paying.I'm OK with this model, except for one fact. I've already purchased three ships at this point, unfortunately they are all now essentially useless since the content auto-levells with you. One (a Tier 5) did have the option to upgrade ""to bring it up to standard at lv50+"". Which I did using a paid-for upgrade kit, making it not a T6, but a T5U. We were told that this was as close to a T6 as this ship class could get.7 days later...They have just released the same ship class with a slight stat boost and a new skin as a T6 ship. Unfortunately to use it I have pay full price for it - despite it being 95% identical to a ship I've already puprchased (it's even advertised as being the T6 version of the ship). Because of the nature of the game my existing ship (the T5U) version will be useless and honeslty I'll just delete it from my ship hangar. I would feel much better if they offered an upgrade from T5, or T5U to T6 rather than making me pay full price again. I'm not alone (according to the forums) in feeling slightly cheated/misinformed by this. It seems like this is the plan for new ships, so essentially, just be aware that when you play this game, you'll be expected to pay (between about £7 at lower levels and £35 for highest levels) for ships, and that realistically you need to buy at least one or more at the top levels to play, in addition to any vanity purchases or optional choices you make. Again, not necessarily a critisism of the game or the pay model, but a definite criticism of the communications between the company developing the game and the players regarding real-money-investments. Knowing what I do now, I would not waste my money buying any 'lower' class ship, since they are useless, and I would have just waited until now and spent that money on a T6 instead.",Wed Jan 05 21:06:00 EET 2022,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

The ship desings and mechanics are sound, They're fun to play for a few hours every now and then, but by god dont get me started on the ground combat.

Voice acting in some parts and none existant in others, you would be best off just turning off the sound and listening to music while doing this grind of a game, actually, dont even pay attention to the missions either, because you soon get lost in what you're doing, even while paying attention.Now, what I did like about the games was the nice little tutorial stories each faction has, it realy feels like you're a member of the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Empire and even the Federation, who of which were the most enjoyable with the whole Borg element.

In the begining, it was fun, with the 2 main segments, Ground and Starship, allowing for the game to change what you do, so as to not get bored. But after this initial euphoria, I sadly have to admit, the game is mind-numbingly boring. Every mission has the same basic structure; Warp in, alternate between space and ground combat, then warp out again. It becomes a grind during the mid-game, and dispite attempts to make you solve puzzles or resolve issues, it becomes a mashing ""F"" contest, as you don't have to do anything other than that 99% of the time. On the rare occasion a genuine puzzle comes along, its solution is either highlighted in a text box, or told to you when you begin. And then the cash-grabbery. I would overlook moderate cash-grabbing in a F2P game; servers are not free, but the preposterous extent of the cash-grabbing in this game is unforgivable. You are capped at 10.000.000 Credits, unless you buy an upgrade. This would be fine, were it not for the fact that the majority of good late-game equipment costs much more than this. The vast majority of ships are locked behind their own paywalls, as are the more iconic outfits, such as the TOS uniforms, just to ring every possible penny out of the playerbase. However, worst of all is that the best, endgame ships are in lockboxes, which you have to buy keys for. But with these ships having an ~0.4% droprate from these crates, to get them you must either waste far too much money, or be very lucky. This guts the endgame, as if you dont pay into the system, you become obselete. Even at endgame the missions are boring and repetitive. Don't play this alone, get a friend who owes you a favour to go through it with you. Its comunity made missions can be fun, but the creator for theses missions is difficult at best. As a Star Trek fan, I have to honestly give it 4/10, as much as it pains me and my 11 days of playtime to do so.",Thu Nov 11 00:42:02 EET 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

You will understand why by reading this review.I'll start with the pros, to give you an idea of why i chose to play this game (non-steam client) for more than a thousand hours. I've started a bit before Mal Damba was released, and seen a quantity of the many aspects this game took.Pros+ The game, at it's core, is fun. Visual feedback is great, and certain champions are incredibly fun to play (Mal Damba! But also kinessa, lian, etc.)+ Lively game (for the moment!) so matchmaking often takes almost no time.+ Currently no pay 2 win mechanics+ Great art direction especially on the environment. Coherent and really readable visuals (I insist on its readability. It really ticks, unlike a certain game it is rather... inspired from). Some really great character designs (but some others being terrible in equal measure).+ Grohk the blue orc.Cons- Clearly one of the worst game balances I've ever seen. A few top tier champions are always picked, so much that a good third of the champion cast are never present. As I am writing this review the game is in OB67, and ranked matches are grounds for only the same faces all the time: Makoa/Moji/Talus permaban in almost all ranks, and every match having Seris, Inara, Zhin, Tyra, Ash, Fernando, BK, Lian, Lex and Jenos. Casuals are even worse since there are no bans and the triad of doom is always taken, ending up in very frustrating, imbalanced matches.- Generally very bad design decisions. The game is constantly fighting against itself and every countermeasure introduced to fix a problem becomes another, bigger problem by itself. Healers are too strong? Buff Cauterize (healing reduction on hit item, buyable in-match) to 90% at a cheap lvl3. 90% yes, and it is the same for Resilience (CC reduction) which is one of the cheapest items in the game. Bam, almost full invulnerability to cc's, giving cc-reliant champions a very hard time even surviving, and dumbing down lategame to a brainless shootfest without strategy.Combine very small maps with low respawn times and mounts, and you have a game that is very hostile to flanking and doesn't leave breathing room if you pull off multiple kills by yourself as a damage/flanker, also adding to the frustration because whenever you flank you have a very high chance of being suddenly ambushed by a newly respawned opponent without having enough time to react to their sudden apparition, gotta watch these respawn timers closely :^). How did they ""fix"" this? By making flankers unbearably strong against their supposed targets, and thus extremely difficult to balance (one single fix can make a champion useless, cf Skye, or completely broken, cf Talus.)Patch after patch, they also continually lowered the skill floor for champions by enlarging the size and raising the speed of projectiles by absurd amounts (what would have been a typical quake 3 rocket launcher speed on evie's staff for instance, has simply become an instant-hit from a reasonable distance. This has been the case for all projectile-based champions).They also introduced auto-aim skills on certain characters, lowering the skill requirements even further. While I don't mind accessibility, constant decisions like these make the game especially frustrating, as many shots are simply unavoidable (moji flames, bk royal subjects explosions, zhin/maeve/evie/ash/willo shots, drogoz spitspam,...) without using skills that grant iframes (which not everyone has) even between the hands of novice or very bad players.All this leads to a meta where the only thing that really works is a 2tanks team with a very strong healer with great survivability (seris/jenos), an unkillable flank (talus/zhin) and a tank wrecker (tyra/bk). No room for creativity, or you get utterly destroyed simply because the opponent had a better composition.Paladins also inherits from the bad aspects MOBAs have, as in, if you perform badly, your whole team will suffer. And the chances to lose just because of one single player not doing their job are immense. This, also, is very frustrating (and actually the reason why I am rewriting this review: Just went out of a losing streak of 6 matches, in which I performed unusually well, but lost because of another mute, illiterate player ego-picking a damage champion (thus forcing a teammate to play something they are bad at), and then flanking alone to evidently die.)- HiRez has a history of constantly disrespecting their playerbase if not even showing contempt to them, by not listening to player feedback, introducing pay2win mechanics destroying the whole game (infamous OB64 patch from which, hopefully, they backpedaled. Dig the controversy around this patch if you want a good laugh, or to facepalm yourself through the ground), exploiting early access state to excuse an unstable client, game-breaking bugs and performance issues, which they left as-is up until now. If you need more evidence look at what happened with Tribes: Ascend, Global Agenda and Smite.Paladins has been in Open Beta since around... 4 years now? Yes, 4 years of beta.- Easy Anti Cheat. This should be a huge red flag. Their client also installs two almost useless but mandatory bloatware services on your machine (hipatchservice). If you are concerned about privacy, be prepared for a proctology exam.- As much as I hate using this term there is no other way around this time: the community is insanely toxic (LoL/Dota2/csgo levels of cancer). Diamond players are the worst offenders in general. In parallel, a ♥♥♥♥♥on of ragequitters (even in ranked, doing this on purpose to ruin their comrades' ladder climbing) and cheaters (teleporting payload, mounting mid-fight with infinite CDs, aimbotting, wallhacking, you name it).Reports don't seem to work also, and the penalty for leaving a match is a joke.- Insanely bad matchmaking. In ranked you'll often see silver/gold players being matched up against diamonds, lots of people with ranks they are not supposed to have (diamonds playing like total newbies, and gold players that play superbly well). There are also rumors of matchmaking forcing players who paid for skins against much worse players, preferably free2play.From a gamedev standpoint, they have awesome artists, contributors and dev staff, whose work is being ruined by the greedy, unethical mentality and business practices applied by HiRez's higher ups.That's all I can think of right now. If you're still not convinced (you masochist :p), try it out by yourself since it is free. Just please do not give them your money, they do not deserve it as they are currently.",Fri Jul 02 09:46:33 EEST 2021,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

Splitting the playerbase is killing smaller regions, and we aint even that small but your queue times have more than quadrupled. The matches you DO get are full of complete saltiness instead of the prior mild salt, probably due to long term players being unhappy with the state of the game. The future looks like you want to head into pay to win, and you guys at Hi-rez know how quickly two of your games died out after you patched for pay to win schemes. Those patches were pretty much the heat death of your universe in that game, and you obliterated your player bases.

If by chance they scrap this system entirely in future updates, this review may not be as relevant.OB64 is here and Hi-Rez continues to disappoint with what I think is actually the worst update Paladins has ever seen. The card system is complete trash and pay to win for casuals (most people play casual/quickplay). Getting your cards to their max level takes so many duplicates and chests that even players who spend hundreds of hours on the game will have a very hard time doing it. On top of that, the game's balance was destroyed even further with new broken legendary cards (Makoas new legendary, Kinessa's new legendary) and broken loadout cards. New Players will have a much more difficult time now than ever before against players that spend some money or those that have played for a while. Another variable will be introduced to matches outside of individual skill level, strategy or teamwork, and it’s not one that needed to be there. Your “wallet” size shouldn’t determine the outcome of a match, but it’s something you will see in quickplay/casual. With that being said, Paladins now feels even more broken, buggy and unbalanced with horrible design decisions to loadout cards and lack of testing. It baffles me that so many bugs and problems get through when new patches (and this update in particular) are implemented. It’s a complete mess to say the least. It’s unfortunate, I really do like Paladins (at least I did before OB64) but Hi-Rez can't be trusted to make sound decisions based on what the community wants. I understand that an audience may not always know what it/they want, but there is no way that Hi-Rez didn't see the backlash and skepticism people had about this update weeks before it was released. On top of that, Hi-Rez’s only concern seems to be sh*tting out new costumes and cosmetics rather than fix their own game. Their management clearly doesn’t have their priorities straight. With all that said, this update will definitely hurt Paladins more than it will help it. It does so much wrong and it seems like a slap in the face to their players. I will not whine or complain any longer though, as that doesn’t seem to be effective at all. If Hi-Rez ever learns from their mistakes, it will be when their player base completely dies off. As a long time player of Paladins, I am going on a “hiatus” from this game until at least some of these problems I listed are properly addressed in future updates. If that means that Hi-Rez never fixes these problems, then I see no reason to continue playing. Anybody reading this who feels the same should also DO the same. Actions speak louder than words, and nothing grabs the attention of a company more than losing their consumers. No consumers, no money, and in turn, no company.

Having recently finished the first Deus Ex (DX), it would only be logical to delete my savegames in Deus Ex: Human Revolution (DX:HR) and completely start over: I can now compare the newest installment of the franchise to its original. Regardless, I am not going to burn DX:HR for all the things that it does different in comparison to DX. The gaming industry has changed and it would only be fair to keep things relative, just like how I did not hammer the graphics or some bugs in DX. \n\nThere are a couple of things that  form the essence of the Deus Ex franchise, and luckily most of these things are found back in DX:HR. To keep this review brief I will mainly focus on content, one of the things DX:HR excels in. The graphics are not awe inspiring as far as today's technology goes, but they are exactly what you need to immerse yourself in the setting DX:HR provides. There is a yellow/gold taint throughout the game that, although not positively received by everyone, makes the atmosphere consistent whereas the different designs of individual in-game locations make sure it does not feel repetitive. \n\nAudio-wise this game scores a lot of points. The used sound effects are decent to good, but what really stands out is the voice acting and music. Adam Jensen (voiced by Elias Toufexis) has thé sexiest voice I have heard in media for a while, but let's not forget about the others. A proper dosis of emotion make the characters sound convincing which makes it easier for the player to put themselves in their position, as unfortunate as that may be at times. To top it off, Michael McCann has provided an OST that does not only sound amazing, it also fits the atmosphere in a way that it's modern and just seems appropriate for the year 2027. \n\nAs far as the story is concerned, some players might find that it resembles DX too much, but they might be forgetting the fact that DX:HR is a prequel to the original DX. A lot of organizations and wrongdoings that concern the player in DX have their roots in DX:HR and therefore might make the story appear similar. However, an important difference is how Adam Jensen is operating from a corporate perspective in a world that is in the grasp of the power that large corporations have, this allows for some interesting problems to occur. Coupled with ethical dilemmas, the plot of DX:HR might be confusing for your average FPS gamer but will definitely intrigue those that are still reading at this point. \n\nThe gameplay is a clever mixture consisting of RPG elements, actual RPG gameplay (unlike many self-proclaimed RPGs - this is also mentioned in my DX review), basic shooter elements, and minigames that don't seem intrusive or out of place. So far it does not seem too different from DX, however, one point that bothers a lot of franchise fans is the fact that boss fights are in no way avoidable (edit: unless you have the director's cut!). This does not blend well with the fact that the AI can be pretty iffy at times. Regardless, this does not keep the player from experiencing, what I would call, a very worthy prequel of Deus Ex. \n\nI regard this game very highly, especially in today's market that seems mostly dominated by uninteresting games as far as shooters are concerned. My verdict is to buy this game, you must have tried it at least, there's a good chance you will embrace it and its franchise.""",Mon Nov 29 15:37:13 EET 2021,9880c50d-ffda-4cad-8311-0ab8fc5844f6

Every bad decision, every bug, everything I would hate in a \""normal\"" game, I supported this sack of crap. But enough is enough. Since the Devs introduced \""Skill based\"" Matchmaking (yes, I put that in quotation marks for a reason, we will come to that later), this game went downhill.\n\nFirst of all: DbD was always known for it's wide variety of bugs and it's, at best, suboptimal balancing. Like many other unsymmetric competetive games (see examples like \""Last Year: The Nightmare\"" or \""Prop Night\""), this game clearly favored survivors over the Killer, which was in some way understandable, because the biggest part of the playerbase where some trolley people trying to bully the \""Big Bad Guy\"". Okay, i coped with it and became somewhat of a decent Killer and a passionate survivor for the gameplay was fun.\n\nSecond, the game was constantly changing things that either didn't need any changes or needed different changes, based on what the majority of the community was asking for. A lot of things have been messed up by the devs, without me saying much against it, because I thought \""It is their game, they will know what is best\"" and \""I don't have any choice in that anyway, I'll adapt to it\"".\n\nHowever, the game got worse and worse without me realizing it, because of these thoughts. And now, at the culprit of all, after so many years I accompanied this game, it finally reached the point that even scared me away. And why? The answer is clear: \""Skill Based\"" Matchmaking.\n\nAn obscure way of matching players, that the Devs themselve can't even really explain and / or show ingame, solely based on \""We have our eyes on it, trust us, it works...somehow...\"". In the begining, everything is fine, seemingly. But as soon as you reach a (kind of) mediocre \""skill\"", you are matched with people way over your level that completly destroy you. May it be as survivor or as killer. Sure, there are people that can do it. But these people either play the game 24/7 or are part of the 10% elite that are good enough to beat literally ANY opponent, no matter what. And that is, unfortunatly, hardly enjoyable at all for everyone else.\n\nIf you enjoy putting your efford into thousends of hours into one single game or belong to this 10% group that is naturally talented of killing / surviving at any circumstances, I do in fact recommend this game, as of it's current state. If your are looking for a relaxing, casual or semi-casual experience to just have some fun without beeing forced into a complete sweat-off, you are in the wrong place buddy.\n\nI loved this game for years, but the time has come to move on, I think. Farewell, Dead by Daylight, maybe I will see you again in your former glory...But at your current state, I just can't enjoy you any more.""",Wed Jul 07 14:52:50 EEST 2021,16c54f00-1cb1-4c8d-9cc7-38895a645882

Why did you guys remove the previous maps? It gets very repetiive way too soon. And now the main problem I see is aimbotters playing this game.3/10Still a shi.tty game. After the most recent updates they have done nothing to fix the problems mentioned below. Instead they remove more from the game and made the characters way to expensive to even want to grind for gold now. They got rid of their battle royale mode and still haven't seperated the TDM mode from the Onslaught mode. And I'm not alone... the 3 other people I played this with already stopped because of what these stupid developers did to the game.These as.swipes at Hi-Rez reset my ""daily login bonus"" from 11+ days to 0 as well as the ""Champion Quest"" where you need to complete 40 daily quests to get a purple chest. So now both of those are on 0 and here I am wondering why? Apparently they did the same thing to my friend so I don't recommend this game. It doesn't seem worth the effort... (Apparently after googling it... it turns out it's a known bug that's never been fixed. Go figure. I've already encountered several bugs now with this launcher even though this is supposed to be a ""beta"" and it's been out for years now... Also like I said a lot of these bugs are known/reported and never fixed for years. Seems to me the dev's just don't care and use the game as a cash grab off the morons that pay to play it.)I'm sick of queuing up for ""Team death match"" and being put in a fu.cking ""Onslaught"" game. And the game is clearly unbalanced where some champions just dominate an entire team solo. I do not recommend playing it at all. The dev's don't know how to balance s.hit and with their patches they just ruin the game more and more. I'm at the point where I'm ready to uninstall this piece of s.hit and hope the company goes bankrupt as well.At first it may seem fun but the more you play it the less likely you'll like it. The balancing issues, horrible matchmaking, long queue timers as well as in game timers, try hards, afks, noobs on your team, the grind for card/account/character leveling, laggers, no ping cap limit/region locking, perma stuns/crowd control effects, perma ""reveal"" trash where people know where you're at 24/7, daily gold cap limit, daily champion chest limit, slow leveling, etc seriously take their toll on the gaming experience. This game could have been amazing but as of right now it's trash in my opinion. There's too much wrong with it which you'll find out for yourself if you try it out.Old Review:6/10Yes and no...I only recommend it if you're playing with ""friends"" and have your own party going where there's actually real teamwork going on/communication. Then it's a lot of fun aside from the few retar.ds you may be paired up with on your team. If you're not playing with friends then good luck... you'll have 0 team work going on and most of the time people just feeding and playing the game like it's a Call of Duty shooter.Over all it's seemed like a decent game but as I mentioned before be prepared to grind those card levels up, have afks on your team, feeders, hardcore noobs that don't know what they're doing, being put up against try hards, a lame daily gold cap limit (free currency), daily limit of 5 free chests (so the grind is real), long queue times (worse when retar.ds don't click ready), long starting times because laggers joining the wrong servers, long starting game times because of too many different timers they have implemented for choosing different c.rap, horrible in game chat menu/commands, and the launcher is pretty buggy (where some of these bugs have been reported 2 years + ago and still not fixed). The launcher sure is bugged. When ever I minimize or use the steam overlay (Shift + Tab) the game gets all bugged where my cursor dissapears.The more I play it the less I like it. I thought the whole ""unbalanced"" thing was a joke. But after playing it longer and longer you can see how badly the game needs to be balanced. When healer classes are out doing damage classes in damage then something is wrong. That explains why people always play the same op usual characters. And playing solo is generally no fun in this game at all. Also the matchmaking is bad where sometimes you have a 0 chance of winning against the try hards that have all their cards maxed out and only play the most op characters. It makes the game really boring and at times I feel like I'm ready to hit that ""uninstall"" button.After this recent update (2/21/18 patch) they got rid of my favorite mode ""team death match."" Apparently they merged the team death match queue with the onslaught queue. Why the f.uck would you do that? And the new battlegrounds mode just feels so empty/boring. I don't want to play no f.ucking ""king of the hill"" (onslaught) s.hit when I dont give a fu.ck about holding a point. So now when I queue up for ""Death Match"" (the only mode similiar to team death match) it puts me in other retar.ded game modes I don't want to play. Hi-rez sure has some retar.ded developers that don't know what they're doing. It didn't even help with the queue times either instead it's taking twice as long or longer to get into a game now. This game is defintely going downhill. It's starting to look more and more like a mobile game where it's a hardcore grind and microtransactions determine whether or not you have fun. I guess this explains why it's definitely not as popular as it once was several years ago...",Thu Jun 24 07:00:15 EEST 2021,c2c2affb-ead9-402a-a875-9b2336656d50

Yes, this borrows many things, even character inspiration from Overwatch, but that is just about where it ends. I have spent about 300~ hours on Overwatch. I have dont it all from casual to ranked, dicking around in some of the terrible brawls. While Overwatch is a well polished game, it just does not compare to Paladins at all. I would firstly like to talk about the whole ""ripoff"" aspect people seem to take on when looking at this game. Overwatch did not invent most of the content in their game, they borrowed a lot from other games. What is a game but a collaboration of other ideas taken from others?Not every game is unique. You will find in almost every genre, in almost every title, they borrow a majority of elements from other games and put their own spin on it. This is exactly what Paladins has done here. This game is in depth character building via the card system and distrubuting points among 5 different cards, which you can pick from a pool of 16 different cards. It is not the same 16 cards for every character, they all have 16 DIFFERENT cards especially made for that character only. With 17 characters at the time of this writing, that is 272 different cards, that can not only be assigned to a hero, but leveled up with the 12 points given to boost their effects even further. Neat!Then, while in game, similar to how you gained ""fire"" on Overwatch, you gain credits instead. These credits can be used to purchase temporary buffs in game that only last until that one game ends, and can also be upgraded into 3 different tiers further boosting their effects. You can change up the buffs you buy every game depending on the enemy team to help further counter their character choice. Do they have Skye (stealth character)? Buy illuminate to help see he cloaked at a longer range, and upgrade that to extend the range, making it much harder to sneak up and get easy kills. The list goes on, that is just a very minor example.The game modes right now are just your basic payload/siege (siege is capture a point, then push payload). I am sure they have more modes in the work, this game is in beta after all. While on the subject of beta, you may be first turned away by the unpolished visuals/maps/audio. I was even turned off by it at first, but the more I played the more it grew on me and I could see that this game has a long way to go. In its current state, this is by far one of the most enjoyable FPS I have played in a long time.So my advice to you: do not come into this expecting Overwatch. That would be like loading up Call of Duty and expecting Counter Strike. Look past the hate and treat yourself to this.

Not all information they look at is put on a public adress, as this is just an example of information you can see happening in competitions.Some balance changes have been good but others have almost completely removed champions from comp play.

I loved Overwatch to death for a year or 2 before the Loot Box grind became far too much for me. So yeah, I was kinda an OW fanatic too, thus instantly hating on the look of Paladins and refusing to try it (same with Smite when I played a lot of DOTA 2 and LoL, but I DID try that game and it wasn't my style at all).After the Dark Tides update, I decided to give it a try. After all, TF2 grew slightly stale with no content updates, and OW just doesn't nearly have the spark it once had. I tried it despite all the complaints, being too unbalanced and too ""pay 2 win""Honestly, this game is pretty damn fun. It's not perfect, it's not even the greatest, but the amount of detail, heart and soul put into the characters and skins. As I've witnessed, Hi-Rez is notorious for leaving games in the dust in search of a new trend. However, they seem to be, even though moving towards trends, aren't leaving Paladins in the dust.Pros:-Movement feels smooth and fine (until you hit a wall, which stops you for some dumb reason)-The characters are cute and likeable, albeit a little basic (at least it doesn't have the pretensiousness of OW's writing)-Its world and design is super fun to look at. I like how it really bends the whole ""gun slinging + fantasy"" style that it has going on-A lot of the game is focussed on it being FUN. Not necessarily being ""the best"" or ""the most complicated"". It seems to focus on an aspect that you're just having a good time.-It has this really nice mix between a MOBA and a FPS. Overwatch leans very heavily in the FPS range much more so than a FPS+MOBA should.-No longer has pay-to-win elements with the cards. Im a huge Battlerite fan and I love the Card system it has that gives life to the game-A lot of the Champs have pretty cool and original designs, even if some are directly based off Overwatch or TF2 champs.-IS THAT GRANT GOODEVE VOICING THE TF2 ENGINEER SKIN FOR BARIK?!?! Even if not, it's hella convincing and I love it.-It's minor but I noticed a lot of effort put into the 3rd Person models for most of the characters. Only Roadhog from Overwatch has an interesting move pace in his actual model since most of it was only focussed for FPS. I like how Paladins pays attention to detail in both aspects.-The way it deals with new skins is actually pretty interesting and much more fair compared to OW. It has a semi-direct-to-purchase method which lets you get some high quality skins, Vault Keys granting you an old and exclusive item set is also a nice touch!Cons:-Balancing seems to be a mess. Champs like Ruckus, Drogoz (who I played the most before reviewing), Lex and Tyras seeming to deal a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of damage with hardly any real counters. Ruckus having a massive shield boost, Drogoz having an abundance of health and an easy escape, and Lex and Tyras doing such an incredible amount of damage in just a few shots.-Hitting a wall stops you instantly. In most other games, you can move sideways or forwards without a 1 second stop. It's a minor issue but when it happens, it's incredibly frusturating and ruins the movement. Especially when you're trying to quickly escape a risky situation-Chests and loot are a complete maze to get through and understand. I know that TF2 has this exact issue, but TF2 has strange weapons, most of which have little-to-no value on the community, especially as far as any new player is concerned. In Paladins: Want the skin? Well let's look at the 50 billion chests that are in the store, all of which are $5 each. Good luck getting a skin you want!                  (BUT HONESTLY, it's a Free to Play game, so this doesn't make too much of a big deal.)For now, Paladins is a blast to play in. Will it be after a couple hundred hours? Who knows? Maybe I'll get too frusturated and end up leaving. But honestly, the characters, art style and its smooth and fun environment are too good to leave behind willy nilly.

The world is edgier and has a riskier element to it Blizzard can't pull off. People might say some elements are similar to OW, but I concur. There are so many interesting original champions in this game, that require a lot more skill than those in Overwatch. Each character can be played in multiple ways, and their skill ceilings feel higher. The healers are actually fun to play in this game, with Ying and Mal'Damba being super interesting to play and play against. Overwatch constains you severely on how you can play.

While there undoubtedly similarities (and even direct inspirations) to many of the Overwatch heroes, this game is pretty different when you get down to the technical side of things.The way I see it, this game is a more approachable game than Overwatch. Not only that, but the Ability selections, Loadout cards and in-game credit shop allow for a more customizable experience in terms of finding characters and playstyles you enjoy. Want more sustain? Equipt health and healing oriented cards. Want an ability more readily available? Equipt cooldown reduction cards. The cards are often low percentages, but you can invest points in a card that you like and increase the impact it has.On top of this, gamemodes are manually chosen and queued for, so you aren't forced to play a mode that you don't particularly enjoy. The option to swap between first and third person on the fly is also a nice touch.That being said, if you were looking to play the Ranked draft mode, I strongly recommend you stay away from it. Currently, the results of your placements can toss you anywhere between Bronze and Diamond, just based on your win/loss rate and the rank of the players you win/lose against. Even once you have placed, you will gain/lose points based on your win/loss ratio. With no consideration for personal performance, you are looking at a system that will punish you the second you go on a losing streak.All in all, if you are looking for a fun, MOBA-style shooter to play casually with friends, I strongly recommend you give this game a try. Just stay away from Ranked for the time being.",Thu Sep 03 08:33:59 EEST 2020,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

It's so abysmally tedious to even just level up one single character with the perks you want, to the point it took me 20 hours just to get 2 of the perks I wanted to use.\n- Many gameplay mechanics are never explained and extremely unintuitive. The game makes almost no effort in teaching new players how to play well, and instead often encourages bad gameplay habits. If you want to learn the game, you will have to rely on external resources just to cover all the basics.\n- The game is insanely unintuitive for new players. The learning curve is EXTREMELY steep. Not only do you need to learn the basics of playing as a survivor, which the game's tutorial barely covers, but you need to learn about every single killer, their perks, their add-ons, and their mechanics, on top of trying to figure out how your own perks work. With 26 different killers, each having 3 perks of their own alongside a dozen add-ons each, you are going to be overwhelmed and confused for most of your first games, and since most Killers are locked behind paywalls, you won't be able to play them yourself to get a better understanding unless you pay more money.\nWhile there are a lot of community-made resources to help learn the game faster, you're going to spend more time trying to read those guides and watching those videos than actually playing the game if you go with that route.\nCombine all of this with the complete lack of a training mode, the aforementioned lackluster tutorial, and the only gamemode being online PvP with an MMR system that doesn't even work, and you've got a recipe for a game that is extremely unfriendly for beginners an frustrating to learn.\n\nSpeaking of the MMR system; It doesn't even work.\nWhat is supposed to create balanced lobbies, instead looks more like completely random pickings - You could get paired up with survivors who have thousands of hours against a killer who just started, or you might end up with teammates who have barely started playing, going up against a killer with thousands of hours of experience. The matchmaking might as well be completely random, because it has no semblance of balance whatsoever and it results in most rounds being a completely one-sided stomp.\n\nThe game's performance is also pretty terrible, being extremely poorly optimized and even having performance issues such as severe FPS drops and stutters for something as minimal as mouse interpolation being set to a high value (the game only seems to support 500 and lower).\nThe default FPS cap is also only a measly 60FPS. This can be raised to 120 with some file changes, but most of the time you'll be struggling to reach that even with a decent PC.\n\nAll of this doesn't even touch on the community yet; While a handful of players are laid back and just trying to have fun, a lot of people in this game seem to make it their sole purpose in life to be as condescending and toxic as possible, all while maintaining an inflated ego bigger than the burj khalifa.\nIf you thought LoL or CS:GO were bad, DBD is going to give you a terminal disease with it's levels of toxicity - Everything bad that happens is always the opponent's fault, and everyone always knows better than anyone else what changes the game needs.\nSurvivors are constantly whining about Killers, and Killers are constantly whining about survivors, the incessant crying over the most menial things is all you will hear in the community hubs, along with perpetual trash talking of the dev studio.\nOn top of that, trolls and griefers are abundant and they [i]will[/i] find a way to screw over you and your team at any given opportunity.\n\nAll-in-all, the game might look cool and fun with lots of content, and I did enjoy playing it when I was queued up with friends, but I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone who's looking to have a fun time on their own, because DBD does everything in it's might to ruin your experience at every turn.\nUnless you have 3-4 friends to consistently play with, Dead By Daylight is not worth your money.""",Wed Jan 12 08:39:42 EET 2022,16c54f00-1cb1-4c8d-9cc7-38895a645882

Well personally I do play both and I would say I enjoy paladins a bit more latelyI played paladins for a bit when it first launched, tbh I didn't like it that much back then since it was full of bugs and lack of servers. But recently I gave it a try again and now I'm absolutely obsessed with it. (The fact that I bought the founder's pack...)I came back and I am really surprised by how much effort the developers are putting into the game. The game is now so much more optimized, haven't encounter any major bugs so far. Another aspect is the diversity and the amount of champions, they really amused me.

So like, these speedygonzaled charecters jump in your face and take a good amount of your HP, and you deal a great bit of damage on them, but here is the issue, they run away, and all you can do is shoot a fairly weak fireball at them and hope they die? Now lets just assume that fireball misses or whatever, doesnt really matter, but then another one of these fast charecters jump in your face and finishies you off? idk, this really feels unfair, Im playing as a tank, 2 light charecters shouldnt be able to just kill me like that without me having much of a chance of ""getting revenge"" or just getting a kill.TL;DR The fireball attack Fernando has is weak as hell (in my experience), and I suggest you maybe get like a 3 shots or somthing with it before it starts a cooldown.Besides that this game is pretty cool, and you should check it out if you havnt.",Sat Nov 02 22:13:45 EET 2019,36632203-f738-4537-9a19-0a723bfe371a

You open loot boxes and hope the character you want to play has their cards in it. If it doesn't you better get to grinding or paying for more chests. In ranked mode everyone is on an even playing field but good luck dealing with new players testing out things because casual can no longer be used for that.

Fun fact: Not only has this game been playable for like a year and in development for probably twice that but you are an idiot if perceived copying is your main argument about the quality of a product (especially when you come out in defense of Blizzard).Pros: - Gameplay is solid, with a lot of different weapons and character skills. Depending on your character you will find everything from assault rifles to shotguns, bows, wands that fire rocket-launcher style projectiles and more; all with a few quirks and character abilities that aid you towards different playstyles.-Fast and entertaining matches. You will seldom have any downtime before you get back into the action and the game is reasonably balanced in attacker vs defender.- Gameplay customization. An interesting card system that lets you specialize your character even more or go in completely different directions, providing bonuses to specific skills or in certain situations. Cards must be acquired with ingame currency so there's no buying your way to the top with real money.- Expanding on the above: very sensible payment model. Champions, a fair amount of skins and cards can all be purchased with ingame currency. Daily log in bonuses can award you a handful of premium currency as well so it's not a stretch to say even the odd premium skin can be acquired for free.Cons:- Sound and art design are a bit weak. Weapons ARE powerful but a lot of the time they don't really sound like it. Mundane character design might be a turn off for some even if nowhere near the worst in genre.- Maps can often be labyrinthine for little reason. Defense and attack can be complicated when there's 5 venues of approach.- Any player's first few matches will be exclusively against bots and in what seems to be only one map. This is not mentioned anywhere (although it's fairly obvious) and might dissuade some players.- The grind for ingame currency can be laborious if you want to unlock a lot of skins and cards.",Fri Dec 10 23:35:16 EET 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

But now that the game is a year old Hi-Rez, in their common fashion, is trying to kill it just like they did with Tribes. This decline started when the essense currency was released. Paladins already had 2 currencies, so adding a third was just unneeded and added more grind. Then Hi Rez started nerfing mobility in almost every champ. Then they decided to add Vivian, who not only is horrifically broken, but also boring and poorly designed. The most recent issue is the new patch OB64. This patch pretty much makes the player have to grind for chests and duplicates to get better at the game. Yup giving an in game advantage to players who have good luck, and money. Amazing. Lets also not forget how instead of fixing the thousands of bugs and issues with the game, HiRez insteads just continuously adding unwanted champs, systems (Cards Unbound), and more bugs with this content. If I were reviewing Paladins on release, I would 100% recommend it for anyone. But now HiRez are making the game worse with every patch. From P2W systems, and unbalanced garbage.

The first time i installed paladins i was amazed to how much this game is like overwatch but not as polished, but only when i got overwatch i realised that the two games are completly different overwatch is more toxic and has a lot of salt in it while paladins doesn't have that at least not that much as overwatch. Of course there are some things that I'd like to be in paladins that are in overwatch like herochanging but that would take away the fun and experience you get when playing paladins. So when i got overwatch I stoped playing paladins because i thought overwatch was more fun, but now a few months later i realised that paladins is a way more fun to play and just because of salt and toxicness. And as a bonus paladins is free, I would play it even if it were pay to play. And overwatch is 30 bucks last time I checked. It also doesnt have voice chat so little children dont scream in your face.

BUT, if you're a poor and broke player like me, who doesn't want to spend IRL money on game, you'll probably agree to what I'm gonna say,The old quest system,2 easy quest with money and VIP as rewards, and 1 big quest with Crystals and VIP as reward.Alot of us probably did the big quest just to get those crystals, I think we can all agree to that.But the new OB68 removed that, and replaced all of them with normal and easy quests.That just ruined it for me, cause I've to spend that long, that whole week just to get some crystals from daily logging rewards.Second of all, the cosmetics systemOne of the reasons why I like this game alot is because you can mix and match cosmetics like TF2.You can have great cosmetics combos, like Jenos' Jason Mask and the Millenium makes up a badass looking god character. You can have Viktor with the DOOM outfit and wears an eyepatch to look like somesort of menacing looking leader guy.But the new OB68 removed that feature, and you can only wear 1, JUST 1 COSMETICS AT A TIMEThe Jason Mask looks bland now, just a default Jenos with a different mask.Not only that, everytime you play a match, the items you have for your Champions will reset, meaning you'll have to equip them again on match everytime you want to use it, or you'll stuck with the default guns and stuff.Third, the menuAscension Peak is great, but the old menuJust the old menu brings and makes the game unique, but the new loading screen makes me sick.I know this game wants to be successful like Overwatch, but do you really have to go as far as making the ALMOST SAME MENU SCREEN FROM OVERWATCH?Really Hi-Rez? If you want to be successful and better, make something unique of your own.Fourth, the voice packsThe old voice packs, you can just get em for a few golds, but nowNOW YOU'VE TO SPEND 200 CRYSTALS JUST TO GET A SINGLE VOICE PACK FOR A SINGLE CHAMPION!What the ♥♥♥♥? Did you know how hard 200 crystals is to get them?I would've just spent them on skins like Tribalman for Grohk and Justice for Lex.The only thing I like about this ♥♥♥♥ing update is you can now get common items back.I'm trying to save up to get the Justice skin for Lex, and probably one for Skye, the Pilot.Common's are great, and they're sometimes better than Epic and Legendary skins.So Hi-rez, if you would please bring the good♥♥♥♥♥♥back, me and some of my friends, or possibly the community would be happy.--{UPDATE OB70}--Oh boy oh boy, where do I start with this...Ah yes, V I K T O ROne sentence, I HATED ITGOD HI-REZ, WHY DO YOU DO THIS?!Viktor is supposed to be a old war veteran soldier type of guy, not somesort of sort of chinese bootleg version of it. Viktor's got the typical ""I lost all my comrade in a mission and I take the blame"" cliche type of backstory, but the new Viktor doesn't seems to have that type of ""look and feel"" to it. The gun is nice, grenade is odd and the skin is♥♥♥♥♥♥ done.The new Viktor should be a skin instead in my opinion, like Young Viktor or something.The new Viktor just doesn't work, in my and alot of my friends opinion.Battle Pass, couldn't care less about it. The new skins for Jenos, Ruckus, Androxus and Grohk are absolutely fantastic and wonderful, they are really good and badass looking.The Mobile skins are also okay, ish. Covert Ops Lex is definitely a yes, Paladins Strike Maeve is just plain lazy, just give Dreamhack Maeve their mobile logo and some recolors and WALAH! A new ""skin"", although it's pretty lazy, I still like it and I appriciate their effort and time they spent on making these skins. But please make voice packs purchasable with gold instead of crystals, which is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in my, or everyones opinion.Also, rip VIP, rest in potatoAlso this game's got hella bugs in it, which is SO TERRIBLEThe game won't even render Terminus' ult properly, and I end up losing my 20 killstreak.",Mon Jul 27 11:32:05 EEST 2020,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

Initially, I was repelled:- by the fact that it is MOBA (I thought only kids and neckbeards play MOBAs)- by the cartoonish art style (the kind of sh-1-t you see all over deviantART)- by the fact that in every aspect this game tries to appeal to the teenager audience- by the generic character design that doesn't make any sense (for example, Lex - a black policeman-knight with two pistols and ridiculous blonde hairstyle from the 80's; Fernando - a wannabe knight with a flamethrower, Pip - an overconfident scientist in a racoon's (?) body that can turn enemies into chickens; Bomb King - his father was a tin can and his mother was a bomb)But, eventually, my friend persuaded me and I gave it a try, because there were no other MP games that we could play together at that time. At first, it was a bit hard for me, because everything was happening too fast and I didn't know which cards to select and how to play with each class. But I learned it quickly and soon became quite good at this game.It's very dynamic and despite it's numerous flaws, sometimes I enjoy it. There's enough strategy in it and there are plenty of characters to choose from for different play styles. There's something in it both for casual and competitive players. Also, it's not P2W and all you need you can unlock just by playing it – unfortunately, after last few updates it takes a lot of grinding.However, I should mention that matchmaking in this game is not balanced and quite often you get teamed up with complete 1d10ts. And Casual game is just random chaos with no solid teamplay.Anyway, this game is for free. So, there's no harm to trying it out. It's much better to play it with friends who are good at it than on a random queue.

I quit Overwatch a long time ago because I found it way too competitive. This seems more balanced and smooth to me, and I really like the wide variety of heroes as well as their abilities. Of course, I haven't played it without all the new updates, so I can't really compare it from when it first came out till now.Once you find a hero you like and get comfortable with, it will become very fun to play. The heroes are on a rotation if you don't buy the $20 pack to all the heroes and future heroes. That doesn't bother me, as I have already found a hero I like to play with which you can unlock with gold coins. Usually 30000 coins to 60000 coins per hero. 30000 would take you a couple of days of casual-play to acquire. It's not bad, as in that time you can get familiar with the game, the mechanics, and what hero you really like and want to invest your time in.Some people are complaining about playing with bots. You play against bots until level 5, then you play against real players.P.S. It's free.",Sun Jan 09 17:56:57 EET 2022,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

Just because of the efforts Hi Rez is doing to defend its essence idea, I'm going with an impartial analysis, despite not liking this system at all.https://www.reddit.com/r/Paladins/comments/5vy7zd/essence_legendary_updates_thanks_for_all_the/If you want to read about the original essence clustermadness that happened with patch OB44, read at the end of the review from the Chapter ""The OB44 Patch: the essence cluster"". Now, let's proceed with a full review""PALADINS: A NEW-AGE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER""Many people are wondering what Paladins is. Is it a First Person Shooter? A MOBA? The copy of Overwatch for the poor guys? No, it's just a genre on its own. Paladins is firstly a First Person Shooter, but with elements that lead it to a new generation.In this game you'll play one of the available Champions, characters with their own abilities. Each one of them has got a ranged attack, 3 basic abilities with a variable cooldown (like in a MOBA, but fast-paced due to the nature of the game) and a powerful final ability with a way longer cooldown called Ultimate.Considering the fact that each hero has got a defined set of skills, they're inserted in roles, categories that enhance their efforts in certain tasks. So we have characters in the healing field, someone in dealing tons of damage points and others by defending the team with their bodies and lives.Once you picked up the suitable Champion for you, you'll fight to the death in the battlefield in different gamemodes, both against other players (Payload and Siege) and CPU (PvE and the brand-new Survival). At the end of the clash, you'll receive a reward in gold (used to buy some cosmetics, radiant chests that contains cards, essences and other cosmetics/emotes and moreover important stuff like the Champions) and in experience points (both for the Mastery, the level of the current Hero you're using, and the General Experience, the level of your profile).""CARDS LOADOUT: NOT YOUR OVERWATCH COPY, BABE""Reading the first chapter, somebody (or better, more than somebody) would say that Paladins is a copy of Overwatch: both are FPS, both have champions/hero with unique skills, both have different gamemodes, both have classes. But what are the differences in Paladins that brought it to be one of the most played Free-to-play games on Steam? What are its sex appeals?Paladins has introduced a system that might change your gameplay with a specific champion from match to match: the CARDS LOADOUTS.In this game each character has got 16 basic cards (divided in common, rare and epic à la HearthStone) and 3 legendary cards (Hearthstone inspired inc.). These cards are affecting the gameplay someway, changing general statistics (movements speed, basic health, reload speed, etc...) or the behavior of a certain basic ability (cooldown reduction, improved bonus, extra additional buffs, etc...). The basic cards can be put in a deck with a maximum of 5 and can be improved up to 4 times their original value. Those decks are the loadouts. When you insert a card, you spend 1 point. To improve a card, you spend 1 point. Considering this, you have to make a deck of 5 cards and spending a total of 12 points, no more no less. In few words, saving different loadouts, you can play a support as an utility, as a semi-flank or simply in its original role, but more efficiently.But what about legendaries, instead? The legendaries affect the gameplay way heavily than their basic counterparts, usually providing strong bonuses. Before the beginning of each match, you're allowed to choose only one of the legendaries you've got for a specific champion.Let's make a practical example: Fernando, a Spanish tank-defender knight, has got 3 legendaries that provide respectively an infinite shield duration with a reduced cooldown, the opportunity of healing himself up to a certain percentage during his shield relocation or improved damage by the launch of a fireball. Depending on the opponents you're facing and on your loadout, you might choose the infinite shield or another legendary.THE GAME ITSELFYeah, we talked about burocracy here: genre, card, boring stuff. But what about the game itself? Is it funny? Enjoyable? Of course it is, expecially with friends.Paladins is granting fun thanks to the fast-paced matches, sometimes facing opponents that would make clashes longer, but still enjoyable, at the pact you're playing casual. Because in competitive there aren't grains of salt, but entire salty oceans. If you know how to play, however, you'll be granted glady moments, but it's not always guaranteed, expecially if you meet the usual ""idiotic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" guy of the turn that flames and insults. But this happens in every game.That's why Paladins has 2 main Game Experience Walls: one related to the general experience level, the other related to the champions' mastery. You're playing against BOTS till level 5 and, to access competitive, you need to master 12 champions at level 4.FINAL CONSIDERATIONDespite the disappointment in the recent OB44 patch that made the game way more grindy, I enjoyed Paladins so far and I'm changing my original review from ""No, don't play"" to ""Yes, give it a try"" because Hi Rez is trying hard to encounter our esigences. So, in trust, I'll recommend this game. For now.***Here's the original review. You can read it for information, but not valid anymore***THE OB44 PATCH: THE ESSENCE CLUSTERHi-Rez introduced a new currency in game to buy cards which is called ESSENCE. In order to get this currency, you need to spend gold (or crystals, the real cash currency) on radiant chests and hope to find a duplicate card. If you want to craft a certain card, you need a huge amount of essence, expecially if we're talking about legendaries. But what are these cards?The cards are special modifiers that change your gameplay. Before the OB44 patch, you could buy any single card for an amount of 1200 gold each(consistently, below 50% of the actual cost of a radiant chest, where you find these cards). Now, if you want a card, you're forced to buy a chest and to pray the Random Generator Number to get the card you want. If you don't find it, you need to wait for ages before being able to get it.Despite the vast majority of Paladins Players said this system was only deletery and the worst idea to implement (because, if you consider you can buy these chests with real cash and you can get the cards only via these chests, the more you spend more powerful you get), Hi-Rez developers decided to insert this system anyway. But the worst thing of all is about news that transpired from some people playing the Closed Beta of Paladins and avalaible on Reddit Page.This system had been implemented once already during Closed Beta despite the complaints of the playerbase and has been removed only after few weeks later, because the players were tired of that crap and left the game. So, in few words...this mistake has been made once and has been corrected because the game was dying.Unless the devs wake up for a second time and decide to remove this disgraceful stuff (we're in a FPS game, not a MMORPG neither a MOBA), I won't suggest you to play this game because it will only contribute to the P2W campaign of some people, if not everyone of them, of the Hi-Rez HQ. However, in case the headers are going to change that stuff, my final review will change, of course, for the better. I'll wait for the next patch before deciding to leave this game or not, considering Hi - Rez so far managed to listen the community.",Sun Jun 27 22:09:04 EEST 2021,e63b2411-51d4-4e84-b4e0-c141475699e7

It's creative, feels good to play, and doesn't rely on money to start playing (because it's free). The characters are fresh, the maps are interesting, the abilities are decently balanced, there is almost nothing I can say that is not positive about this game. The fatal flaw is simply that this game suffers from the beta syndrome so many new exciting games suffer from. It started as a finished product, and then the developers decided to change it... over... and over... and over again. I liked this game a lot, and with every update I decided I would give it a good shot before deciding the update made the game play worse, but the truth is, every update makes the game play more dull. When you have a game with many characters, they tend to become less and less balanced over time, making it difficult for anyone to play a character that isn't in the meta. The skins are getting a little out of hand, I enjoy content in a game, but all of it is just paid cosmetics, making opening crates feel almost empty... Well, it would feel empty if it weren't for the fact that all of the ability upgrades and actually interesting mechanics in this game are tethered to micro-transactions. While you can technically own everything in the game just by playing for a long time, this would take thousands of hours, and it really does encourage you to buy things in order to enjoy them, there simply isn't enough gold and elixir for everything, at least not in an easily accessible fashion. The game is still fun, and it is definitely worth at least exploring because of the price (nothing), but it just isn't reaching its full potential.

You can have Evie to 1 health, she iceblocks, heals up, and then flys off. Zhin is a new character that can block ALL incomming attacks with his sword. Then when thats over if he is about to die, he can turn into smoke and fly away from you...he also takes no damage in this form. The game needs more work now than when it came out.

I can enter a game with two of my friends, and still lose easy because of the other two players that join. It seems like a game of trolls more then anything.2: The characters have become very unequal. This needs allot of attention. A flank should not be able to kill a damage or frontline character one-on-one unless they get the drop on them.

Brilliant game, incredible gameplay - Lacks the polish and presentation of OW but in my opinion better in every other way.Suggestions to Hi-Rez:  prioritize bug fixing rather than skin releasing, fix hitboxes, increase TTK (the current snipefest meta is NOT appropriate - people play the game because it is NOT CS:GO), lag compensation, polishing, refining the presentation of the game.

This is my honest opinion of the game and information about the game. *PLEASE LEAVE SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IN THE COMMENTS SO I CAN IMPROVE*INTRODUCTIONPaladins, a game made by ""Hi-Rez Studios"". Hi-Rez Studios has experience in the MOBA business as this shows in there newest game, Paladins. Paladins is still in beta and also an Early Access game so of course the game is not fully complete. There will probably have been lots of updates and changes since I wrote this but I will try to update this as Hi-Rez Studios updates the game. Hi-Rez Studios are working hard on this game and consistently releasing quality updates. Paladins usually reaches a peak at around 40k players in 24 hours (as of the I am writing this review). This game is doing very well in player wise and it is no trouble finding a game.CLASSES/CHARACTERSPaladins is a game which looks a lot like Overwatch, the 2 games however play differently. If you have played either Overwatch or Team Fortress 2 you will see similarities in the characters you can play as. There are 4 different class types in Paladins: Front Line, Damage Dealer, Support and Flanker. In Paladins the Front Line is the objective player of the team, if you pick to play as a front line character your team will rely on you to be able to jump on the objective and win the game for your team. Secondly we have Damage Dealer. Damage Dealers... Deal a lot of damage! If you play as Damage Dealer you sit back behind your team and help out your Front Liners so they do not die on the objective. This is an important role in the team. Next we have Support. Support classes do not usually have a lot of health and they are not the best at dealing damage to the other team. If you play as support your best bet is to stay behind cover and heal your teammates who are playing the objective. Lastly we have Flanker. The flanker class is the class that I see being used the least. This may be because the players around my skill level can not use the Flanker characters properly. The Flankers job is to obviously flank around the other team to deal damage where they aren't looking.ITEMS/ABILITIESIn Paladins there is a skills store where you can buy skills to make your character stronger. An example of this is on a character that has a slow reload time you would buy the skill that decreases reload time. You get in game credits to buy skills by killing opponents, playing the objective etc. I think that Hi-Rez Studios could add a few more skills that are made towards certain characters as there is not much variety of items. I think that the rate you can buy more skills is perfect and Hi-Rez Studios has done a great job on it.There are also abilities in this game like there is in DOTA 2 or League Of Legends. Each character has their unique abilities that could change a whole game around at the click of a key. Each character also has an ultimate ability which you can not use as frequently as the other abilities but your ultimate ability is your strongest ability and you should only use it in situations which you really need it.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay in Paladins seems reasonably smooth. Currently there are only 2 game modes Siege and Payload. Siege is a game mode which is first to 4 wins. When the game starts your team will have to try capture a capture point while the other team also tries to capture it. Which ever team is victorious with the capture point will have to move a payload to the other teams base while the other team tries to stop the payload from moving. Secondly, Payload is a game mode where the one team tries to push a cart to the other teams base while the other team tries to stop this from happening. If the attackers are victorious then the sides switch and then the new attackers have to push the cart to the other teams side quicker than the previous attackers did.Paladins plays very well however, most of the maps look the same. Most of the maps are either in a temple or in a snowy area. I think that Hi-Rez Studios should add more variety to their maps.CARDSThere are certain card decks which come with every character. These are different to items but they basically to the same thing and give your character an advantage to the opponent if you have a good card build. The card system is reasonably complicated to explain in a review but you will eventually get the idea of how to use them correctly. For new players I would recommend using the standard card build which Hi-Rez Studios has already built for you.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCEPaladins is not a game with breathtaking graphics, sure if you play at maximum graphics then the game will look great but the graphics do not compare to games like Battlefield etc. I am pretty sure that having amazing graphics was not a priority for Hi-Rez Studios but I think that the graphics are more than acceptable for a game like this.For performance, this game runs pretty well. Paladins is optimised well enough and my friends who play Paladins frequently and I haven't encountered any problems with performance so I think that Hi-Rez Studios have done well.PAY TO WIN?Paladins is a free game so the company that made the game have to make money somehow. Hi-Rez Studios have made a good balance between making money and making the game pay to win. Paladins is not pay to win at all, the micro transactions that you can buy will not make you any stronger on the battlefield. CONCLUSIONPaladins is an overall well made game, it definitely is a fun game and I think that this game will not die anytime soon. You should download it and give it a go, if you don't like it... Try again in a few months after Hi-Rez Studios has made improvements to the game!OVERALL SCORE8/10-marra",Mon Jun 21 18:59:37 EEST 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

But I don't like argument like that, because it basically allow you to compare anything to everything.Characters Kits are very different from Overwatch, even when they serve the same role.Paladis is a really fast paced game thanks to the horses (And also more chaotic), and got slightly more depth in character customisations thanks to the cards and in-game buyables.It's free, in Open Beta, and got a lot of potential. I feel like the only reason people spit on this game without giving it a chance is because Overwatch is a really really, really polished game so you don't really have worse than paladins in Hero Arena Shooter genre (Battleborn does not count, it's more of a Moba.)TL;DR Paladins is a Hero Shooter Arena with a lot of similarities with the only other Hero Shooter Arena available, yet it got potential to be a great game on its own, even if it won't surpass the other behemoth.",Thu Oct 21 00:39:25 EEST 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

In the beginning, this game was super fun, there were a lot of different champs with different playstyles. There were different ways you can play each champ, so basically just a lot of customization. The game was relatively skill-based where a good player would be able to win most of his/her games. Having said all this, the direction this game is heading in is absolutely the wrong direction. The next update that is meant to come out at the time I am writing this is OB 64, and with this update, the game has spelled its end. I say this because the game has become too reliant on microtransactions.Each champion in this game has a set of cards that define his/her playstyle, and you can guess that these cards are vital to the playstyle of the champ. Before OB 64, players were able to unlock any card customize its level within the specific loadout. What Hi-Rez has done now is make it so that all these cards are unlocked for you already but the individual levels of these cards can only be increased by getting duplicates of these cards.To obtain duplicates, unsurprisingly, you must open loot boxes. According to a source on reddit, it would talk you AT LEAST 984,000 gold to upgrade a set of cards to their max level for ONE champion, and there are a total of 34 champions in the game as of now. To put this into perspective, you earn around 300-500 gold per match, so yeah, calling it a grind is an understatement. You could expect this level of grind in an MMORPG, but not in a hero shooter.But, if you're willing to pay for crystals to unlock these chests, then you can get a quick headstart on other players. The reason for this is Hi-Rez is marketing this game in China. The Chinese playerbase love microtransactions, and so Hi-Rez has made this patch in anticipation of the influx of Chinese players. To be fair, there is a competitive mode where everyone has the same level cards, but this only means that you are not bale to practice your champions in a casual mode, and there is also the fact that players are used to having some cards at different levels. All in all, this game is dying, Hi-Rez does not care about its playerbase, and don't play this game. Also, check out these reviews of Hi-Rez, makes it look like a pretty good company, huh?

The combat is fast and fluid and by keeping the powers to a minimum, it's easy to pick up and learn. I did not even need to go watch the tutorials. A single round in-game and I knew how to play. As a free to play game, not once have I felt pressured into buying anything. This is not pay to win and it is not pay to win faster.Things I dislike... I guess there are 2 issues for me at time of writing. It seems like most players struggle to shake the Deathmatch instincts and are too scared to take risks and play the objectives. This is an objective-based game. The mission always comes first.My second issue is that the servers seem to be having a hard time keeping up wih all the players that joined since the steam launch. Finding issues where I can't login or the game gets stuck on authenticating. But Hi-Rez always sorts it out pretty fast, indicating that they do indeed care about this game.Overall, I would rate it a solid 9/10 just because, in the end, this game is built around the core of FUN!",Mon Dec 20 20:31:18 EET 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

I always hated how Overwatch made you bend to the style of the character you were playing.Paladins was a game I would consider my personal favorite, It was my goto game to play with friends. It was free to play without any pay to win garbage thrown in....Notice how I said was.OB64 is a way for Hi-rez to give Paladins the Star Wars BattleFront 2 treatment, except Disney isn't here to slap Hi-rez on the wrist for screwing up.OB64 Takes the customization I praised so highly before and asks ""How can we earn more money from that?"" Prior to OB64 loadouts had a limited number of points you could give to your cards per loadout. Cards had a maximum of 5 levels and you had 5 cards per loadout. It was easy and fair, everyone had the same amount of points to dedicate to a loadout and no loadouts were objectively better just because you gave Hi-rez a little more ca$h.Cards were obtained using Essence which you got by logging in, completing quests and getting duplicates which was a very easy task.In OB64 each card has a Max level of 10 and the level is no longer determined on a per-loadout basis, now cards are always the same level nomatter what loadout they're in. How do you level up cards? Why duplicates ofcourse! How do you get duplicates? by opening radiant chests (Lootboxes), which you obtain by playing the game...or by paying some extra $$$ for some chest keys to speed up the process. The grind is rediculous and it's very unbalanced. Radiant chests contain 3 items per chest (4 if you purchase a boost...ofcourse) there are over 20 champions each of them having an equal amount of cards so it'd impossible to focus on leveling up a specific champion...well sorta.Champion chests are a thing, which are chests that will only give you items for 1 specific champion which decreases the grind..slightly, you can purchase these chests with gold or by playing a bunch with one champion in the UNBOUND mode.Paladins now has 2 modes Unbound (Pay 2 Win) and Classic (The old game but stripped to it's core.)Unbound mode gives you 3 gamemode options Seige, Onslaught and Payload.Unbound players can have card levels ranging from level 1 - 10 (fair right?)Classic Mode gives you 1 gamemode with 2 flavors. Siege, Competitive Seige.Forces all cards to Level 4.Competitive mode is ranked..obviously.It's sad that Hi-rez has gone down this Pay-To-Win road.Hi-rez doesn't listen to the community backlash and overall would sacrifice fan loyalty for a few extra dollars.This game is now a game for the whales. The only thing we can hope for now is for Paladins to recieve a ""Mostly Negative"" on steam and let it die.Honestly If Hi-rez came to me and said they reverted back all the changes they made in OB64 and begged me to come back, I wouldn't. If they'll do this once they'll do it again, thats the end of that.It pains me to give what once was my favorite game a bad review, but I have to try and spread the word to potential new players. If you're new and looking for a good fun game to play with your mates, Paladins is not the game for you.",Thu May 06 06:01:07 EEST 2021,2ef39480-dbee-4a08-8851-469e573a2b7d

I am also reviewing based on what I've known and not about the unknown future.  I hear good things about the current exec, but I never played the game he saved, so I wouldn't know...other than the game is the only game that HiRez has had running for more than a year and a half.That's the problem:  I love this game, it's a great game, but I can't trust HiRez.The way I see it, HiRez has done what Coke-Cola did in 1985: completely change their formula and using some what half-baked, low amount of positive results to push the change....and then slap a price on it (at least New Coke was the same price as old Coke....)That backfired...hard....forcing the company back to the original design after a few months.With that, I cannot reccomend this to people full heartedly.  I say: ""give it a taste,"" and that's about it.====December 7th, 2017 Rage:Avoid this company and its fetish for self canibalizing its games.====September 17, 2016 Review: Firstly I am going to get my elephant out of the room.I am still butthurt at HiRez for what they did to my favourite childhood series: Tribes. They took it, stole its money, dressed it up as something else, and then abandonded it in a gutter in Detroit....So I really, REALLY want to hate everything they make.This game, I can't.Now I'll get the other elephant in the room out.Yes this game has similarities to Overwatch....or BattleBorn...whatever you want to call that, BUT, if I were to make a negative review based on that, then I'd have to make a negative review on Overwatch for Ripping off Firefall / Super Monday Night Combat. All those games have classes that use skills based around, except this game, Overwatch--BattleBorn I guess if you played it--and FireFall have ""ultimates.""So. There I said it. Overwatch sucks because it ripped off FireFall, and this game sucks because it Ripped off BattleWatch Guns of FortQuake 4 Tournament 2142.Yet I thumb it up because I find it fun and charming in its own little way. The customization you can get--not cosmetics, the cards--can make just about each champion a different play out. I'll take my man, Drogoz, for example. Make one deck of cards to make him an AoE nightmare, or another set to make him a 1v1 murderer...can't quite do that with my Lady, Pharah (though her Ult is so much easier to use..)Each ""Skill"" combos into each other. I'll say...Viktor's Grenade into his Fully Loaded rifle...is a scary thing to encounter when you fight someone who can do that well. Cassie can get a loadout that makes her super lethal if you can land every shot...And so on.Really, just give the game a try...play around a bit...you can always uninstall it later for no cost.===And Seriously HiRez, give us the damn Thundersword Bomber in Tribes: Ascend already...maybe I'll hate you less after that.

This might not seem like a big thing but it takes away one of the big factors that has always been fun in Paladins: you can customize your champion to your playstyle by use of cards that upgrade certain abilities. You can take a tank and have them become more of a flank or stay in the tank role and keep defending your teammates. There were different ways to play but everything had a set limit, you could only upgrade a card in your loadout to a level 4 and had a limit of how many upgraded cards you could use in a loadout, that way you're not too overpowered. This system made sense and it made for great gameplay in the few moments when the game was ridiculously unbalanced with some champions.However, with what seems to be a new thing in the most recent update, this system is now gone, with people now starting at square 1 again and having to put either gold or $$ towards buying lootboxes for specific heroes just for the chance that they can level up cards again. Each champion has over 20 cards and some cards need to be leveled up more than once in order to actually gain a level. i.e. you will have to get a duplicate of a card 4 times, in some cases, in order to level it up once, and then get more duplicates to upgrade it again. It's a cash grab and a way to make the game unbalanced, yet again. Now, this might not seem like a big thing to a new player, and I can understand that. But I've been playing for awhile now when the only currency you needed was gold and gems if you wanted to buy cosmetics. Both are still around, but through the updates 3 different types of currencies have been added to the game. There was essence, something you gained through cards and duplicate cards, and were then used to unlock cards in the first system mentioned up above. Nothing too bad, a welcome addition. Next was VIP tokens which, to this day, I still don't understand because it's so obviously another cash grab because you can get 'premium cosmetics' for a subscription based price or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. And then... lootboxes. They've been around, sure, but with each patch, more and more lootboxes were created. Lootboxes for only getting a weapon, only getting an event skin, only getting this that and the other thing. Oh, did you really want this cosmetic item? Too bad. Use real money to but a lootbox and see if you have the chance to win it. If not, thanks for the money. Paladins used to be a free to play hero shooter, but through the updates and time that this game has been out, it's dissolved into an obvious cash grab, Pay to Win, and an unbalanced game where the devs barely know what they're doing half the time and ignoring the playerbase while doing so. tl;dr don't get the game, it's a greedy product that now introduced pay to win mechanics",Sat Dec 11 22:37:51 EET 2021,fc196f94-b366-4378-815a-62b874de0ec2

If you want a hero team based shooter that takes actual SKILL and has actual DEPTH then Paladins is the game for you. Paladins has the card system which can change how a character plays entirely to enhancing it. It also has itemization like in MOBA. Overwatch looks good, but it plays like a f2p title. Ranked isn't about skill, it's about who gets the worst team comp or the worst players on team. In Overwatch you could be the best player in the world vs 5 average players with at least a brain and you can't do much. In Paladins you can actually carry your team thanks to the moba aspects with the abilities and items. The downvotes that have to do with Paladins performance how ever is true. The game has a lot of bugs sadly. You will encounter at least one a match at the very least. If you want to play a fun but casual hero based shooter that looks good, then get overwatch. If you want to play a fun & more in-depth hero shooter that looks ehhh, then play Paladins. Also you overwatch fanboys are ignorant. Stop saying Paladins ripped overwatch off when Paladins was in the making before OW announcement. Only difference is Paladins had the cards and it was closer to a tribes map instead of typical hero shooter maps/gamemodes. But the internal testing wasn't that great. OW was also Titan at first then changed. If you want to say Paladins is a rip off, then OW is a rip off of the TF series easily. It adds nothing new mechanic wise, yet Paladins does. Blizzard hasn't made a single unique product since It's WoW & Diablo 1 & 2, Starcraft days. Diablo 3 is a horrible noob friendly ARPG that took away everything great about Diablo. Hearthstone is a noob friendly p2w mtg wannabe card game. HoTS is a horrible attempt at ripping off a MOBA.

By example, imagine the enemy team has a lot of heroes with shields, then you can upgrade you character to inflict more damage on shields, therefore youÂ´ll be able to carry your team easily. These kind of things are what give Paladins a great strategic feel, and I liked it. You could also decide to upgrade your reloading speed, etc... that can be a vital change in the battleground.On the other hand, there is one thing I didnÂ´t like, but ItÂ´s normal due to it being a Free to Play and Overwatch a Paid game, IÂ´m talking about microtransactions. Yes, Overwatch has microtransaction, but itÂ´s totally optional, as IÂ´ve gotten a ton of Legendaries without having to buy crates, but in Paladins you got those crates that can almost only be purchased via real money, and thatÂ´s a shame because the skins that can be got by normal crates are kinda lame (just same skin with diferent colors)In conclusion, I think this game is great, (I still prefer Overwatch due to characters, etc...) and ItÂ´s totally not P2W, something positive looking at nowadays F2P shooters, and if you want to give it a try, do it, itÂ´s free!",Wed Apr 21 06:16:39 EEST 2021,770b7aa8-2916-4470-b765-887e233ce361

I've had my share of game time, and this game is really really really poorly managed, and slowly becoming a pay-to-win and money sucking, and here are the reasons why:1-First of all, the bugs, my goodness the amount of bugs in this game is insane. For example, ShaLin's Knockback doesn't work half the time (damage goes through but not the knocknack), or Zin's ult (with the damage immunity card) and you guessed it, you take damage and die. Or maybe the fact that I can't see my mouse 80% of the time, no matter what I do (good luck trying to select cards and items). I could make a list of the insane amount of bugs there are, but it's not worth it. You're gonna tell me ""this is early access, so bugs are expected"". No, even in an early access game, when there are bugs, when they are reported, they should be fixed. Meanwhile, instead of doing that, Hi-Rez is making skins and champions, and making premium currencies to suck up money, along with other money grabbing stuff, meanwhile the bugs increase with each patch.2-The ranking system, holy. Why in the world would you have a ranking queue separate of the normal gamemodes ? What's the point of the ranked queues if you're gonna get matched with unranked and bronze players all the time ? The whole point of having ranking queues in a game is to get matched with people the same level as you. Proof that this sytem is pretty much stupid, look at other game's ranking system, all of them have linked ranked and normals, yet no one is complaining there, but are complaining here. But no, you have a hidden MMR for ranked and another one for normal games, meaning that in normals you get matched with bronze and unranked players, which means that you will lose a lot of games, your MMR goes down, and you're stuck with bronze and unranked players for the rest of your normal games. Meanwhile, you're gold or higher on your ranked queues (I was Platinum IV a month ago or so, but I stopped playing, so I got dropped to Gold V). Don't even get me started on the ranked queues matchmaking system.3-Cards have now made the game a pay-to-win, and it will slowly become one fully. Cards used to be static stats that everyone had identical, all you had to do is unlock them. Now what are they ? they're level restricted, which means that the level of the cards influences the power of the card. And how do I level up my cards ? You guessed it, you buy chests. Let's take a scenario: You have 2 Kinessa's aiming at each other's heads, 70% health, they both shoot at the same time, except that unfortunately for you, one of the 2 spent a lot of money on chests, and has level 10 cards, where the other Kinessa has level 4 cards. You guessed it, the Kinessa that spent money on the game had an advantage over the other, leaving one of the two alive instead of both dying on that shot. I seriously despise pay-to-win, and I thought this game wouldn't become one, but I can see that it is gonna be one.",Tue Jan 11 19:14:19 EET 2022,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

Plus you can buy items for credits you earn in match (like in Dota) So: + Nice core gameplay+ Card system that allows for some customisation+/- Simple shop (no complex item combos)+ Pip and Bomb King are cute and positive- Only one game mode for now (now 2, but its all about pushing the payload)- Team chat only, you can't talk to your enemyAnd since I played other Hi-Rez products:+ No ""premium accounts"", ""XP boosters"" and other crap you're encouraged to buy every single second (looking mostly at Global Agenda here). Game doesn't remind you of microtransactions at all, which is great.+ Fast progression. You get 500 gold for leveling a hero up and about 200 gold per match, while all but one heroes cost 5000. You may need to farm a little for cards though.I don't usually write reviews after just 12 hours in the game, but you should play it now, while microtransactions don't bite and community seems pretty friendly (all those ""clone wars"" and such only affect forums).",Sat Sep 25 15:38:07 EEST 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

By example, imagine the enemy team has a lot of heroes with shields, then you can upgrade you character to inflict more damage on shields, therefore you´ll be able to carry your team easily. These kind of things are what give Paladins a great strategic feel, and I liked it. You could also decide to upgrade your reloading speed, etc... that can be a vital change in the battleground.On the other hand, there is one thing I didn´t like, but It´s normal due to it being a Free to Play and Overwatch a Paid game, I´m talking about microtransactions. Yes, Overwatch has microtransaction, but it´s totally optional, as I´ve gotten a ton of Legendaries without having to buy crates, but in Paladins you got those crates that can almost only be purchased via real money, and that´s a shame because the skins that can be got by normal crates are kinda lame (just same skin with diferent colors)In conclusion, I think this game is great, (I still prefer Overwatch due to characters, etc...) and It´s totally not P2W, something positive looking at nowadays F2P shooters, and if you want to give it a try, do it, it´s free!",Fri Jun 11 15:30:59 EEST 2021,69ae2c7c-0aa7-43eb-bb36-601336b0526e

OB64.Anyway, the pros... yeah, this was a fun kinda casual competetive hero shooter/moba. Overwatch clone? Sort of, but with enough identity to make it fun. Also the card system allowed for customization of your characters, much like the talent trees do in Heroes of the Storm.The grind was there, but overall I earned enough gold and essence to get the stuff I wanted. I also spent some real money on a few packs, and a few cosmetics. It was worth it.With OB64, they're essentially getting rid of casual queue, the one that most players play. They are changing the card system to introduce a *huge* grind wall, or you're forced to pay literally $1000+ to level your cards up to 5 by getting a crazy amount of duplicates from lootboxes.If your cards aren't level 5, you're screwed. You'll get stomped without any real chance to fight back. An example:Your Bob, his punch deals 500 damage with the level 1 card.The enemy Bob, his punch deals 2500 damage with a level 5 card.You struggle to deal damage. Enemy hits you twice and you're dead.Bob has 2000 health by default with a level 1 card.Enemy Bob has the card at level 5, boosting his health to 5000.In short: There's no more balance. It's ruined. They created an unfair playing field. Casual/Quick Play queue is extremely crap and frustrating to play now. Ranked isn't for everyone, and even if you play it, all cards are level 3, no exception. More fair, but doesn't really offer any balance either.Devs have said they *will* push this patch on december 13th.My thoughts? With the extremely negative reception of this patch, I foresee many players leaving, or playing less. It looks to me like they want to end this game, and make as much last ditch effort money off it as they can, right near the holidays. Overall, Paladins seems to be going the way of Tribes: Ascend and Global Agenda, two other now-dead HiRez games. They registered a new IP for a sort of PUBG clone. We'll see if that'll work, I guess.I dunno if the devs really want this change, or if the management is pushing this through. Either way, it's going to happen. Also, it's useless to voice your concern about it to the devs. It usually gets ignored. Heck, my post offering constructive criticism and suggestions on alternative ways to handle these changes were deleted for no reason at all. It was not offensive, not one bit. And yet, that gets deleted. I made a post about my post getting deleted: Also removed within 5 minutes. -.- If that's how kind concerned players are being treated, then forget it. Let your game die, then. >.>My advice: Don't spend money on Paladins. Don't even bother playing it. It's sad, because I genuinely enjoyed the game, despite the many bugs. I would recommend you at least try it, if it wasn't going in this direction. I'd say..wait at least 'till summer 2018 to see how it has survived. I myself will be keeping an eye on it from a distance. But the Paladins team has lost my trust, and my respect, with both the game changes and their treatment of my offered assistance.If you *really* want to play a PvP focused MOBA-ish game by HiRez, play Smite. It's been out of beta for years and relatively stable and played by millions. I've certainly enjoyed it since I started playing, and I'm nearing my third year of playing Smite. It's not perfect, but it's heading in a better direction than Paladins.So sadly, no, I can't recommend this game to anyone. Not unless they fix all the crap they're breaking with OB64. No more lootboxes. No more grind2win or pay2win. No more unfair playing field. Fix the bugs. The random ending of matches, to name one. Or the voice/chat mute buttons no longer working. And a plethora of others.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update July 2018:Well, they sort of saw OB64's negative impact and changed it. Reverted back to the old card system. That's good. They removed Payload maps. Now you can only play Siege and Deathmatch. Wait wat? Where's Onslaught, the king-of-the-hill mode? Oh, it's *in* the Deathmatch queue. Yeah. The two modes are combined in one queue. So over half the time you'll play Deathmatch (on the only DM map available) when you really wanted Onslaught. Why? This is such a stupid decision.I've tried out some practice stuff after this and...I guess it's fine. The only match I played went horribly so I can't really comment too much on the state of the game. But I'll say this:Don't be fooled by Paladins suddenly no longer being in beta. The game is still very much beta. They had to remove the beta tag for the Nintendo Switch release since Nintendo doesn't allow beta games on their platform. There's so much they still have to fix, and they never really do, anytime soon or at all. They changed the main screen to mimic Overwatch's quite directly. They haven't finished all the loading screen cards, to mimic Smite's loading screen.I dunno, there's so much wrong...I'm sure it's playable to a degree, but.. sigh.. this game's already lost my trust and my respect. I could technically play a little here and there, but I'm no longer motivated to invest as much time in it as I used to. Or at all, really.I'll just stick with Smite. It's far from perfect, but I have more faith in it, as well as its continued evolution. So far it hasn't pulled a horrible move like OB64.",Sat Apr 03 23:44:00 EEST 2021,afa9d621-e4d9-4e05-a799-77772d6dd149

It used to have an interesting deck customization system that allowed you to choose different play styles.But with OB64 this is going to change in a few minutes now (game has been down for 9 hours because of update deployment). No more free deck customization, introduction of a P2W mode for what used to be casual (a place to chill and train). Ranked games won't allow customization anymore. Every decision made for this patch is messed up.If you are still considering downloading this game here are a few other points where Hi-Rez lost this game and failed this community:- Matchmaking is terrible (not based on your skills or rank).- Power Creep is live with new champs always making more dmg than the older ones.- Balance is completely inconsistent with changes that can kill your champ in one single update. Just for reasons that won't ever be explained (say hi to Ash for me).- Bugs everywhere that made us call this game Palabugs (true story).- Support team will never really help you if you loose points based on techical bugs. At the end of the day, it is always unclear if it is on their side, so they consider it's your fault (presumption of innocence anyone?).- Community has never been shaped well. They do not listen to their players.- They release more and more heroes that require no skill (auto aim or crazy area dmg).Anyway, if you are still going to hit that ""play now"" button, good luck, have fun.

From 20 cards, you pick 5 which enhance certain abilities and aspects of champion. So you can play chosen champion how you see fit.

It's slower, has WAY less one-hit-kill situations, the Ultimates are not as impactful in the team fights, and has way more hitscan weapons. The matches have way less crazy, over-the-top stuff going on than OW, but at the same time I rarely feel frustrated at cheap deaths or extremely lucky plays from my opponents. Items seem like they could be this super deep and interesting system, but they're really not. Once the match starts you pretty much know what are the optimal items to buy. They do affect the strategy in hero picks, though. And the hero-picking is PERFECT.

Let me summarize this massive update: When Star Wars: BattleFront 2 (2017) was ruined by its loot box system, Hi-Rez literally (and I mean literally) took inspiration and applied the exact same system into Paladins. This game is exactly the same as Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (2017)'s progression.Veteran players who had every single item in the game (For example: Me)Veteran players who dumped hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game (For example: Me)These players had their collections destroyed. We had every card, we had every single perk. Now? We don't.Hi-Rez took hundreds of dollars from me and my fellow Champions, and threw it all away.♥♥♥♥ you Hi-Rez.If you wanna complain about this, do it on the Reddit. Don't bother with the Steam forums, you get banned for smack-talking this game in any way by the Nazi mods.I will never play this game again unless the system dramatically changes. Not just dramatically, mind you. I don't want the system we had in place for the past year, I want the old system. We all want the old system. None of this modern horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ you have my god damned word.Discussin comments, I will reply as quickly as I can if you have any questions.God help us, because Hi-Rez won't.PS: They complained about Paladins stealing from Overwatch, let me say my peace on this.Most of the designs in Paladins came first. Fernando was a thing long before Overwatch was a pipe dream. I own both games, and I have no bias towards either company, I like both companies' past works. I prefered Paladins over Overwatch for many, many reasons. Main reason was Paladins required decent skill and knowlege of the game to do well. Now I play neither. Do your research before you comment, thank you.They said Paladins was the poor man's Overwatch, now Overwatch is the poor man's Paladins.

Not necessarily because it's a bad game but because of how younger modern day gamers think of games of the same or similar genre. It's one of those unspoken type principals nobody really says out loud but many think it. The most popular game of a genre and its fanbase for some magical reason become the template/standard or judge for any other game of same or similar content that comes out. So yes I'll make references to both games at times so please bear with me. What's that? The characters have ultimates in this game also!? Oh they're totally stealing that idea from Overwatch! What's that? They have a SNIPER class character also! How dare they steal that idea from Overwatch even though Team Fortress 2 had a sniper class long before Overwatch was even an idea. Not to mention neither Team Fortress 2 or Overwatch OWN the concept of sniping in a game. But hey who's keeping track of these things? What's that? A guy with a flamethrower? How dare they steal that idea from Overwat.....Oh yeah they don't have that class of fighter.....BUT Team Fortress 2 has Pyro class.... so... there's that. Oh I was completely unaware Paladins needed permission from TF2 and Overwatch to do anything. I guess I didn't read that memo. A fanbase shouting at another fanbase saying ""We have ""ABC"" in our game therefore you can't have ""XYZ"" in you game or we'll scream how your game is lousy copycat!"" is simply being fanatically overprotective of a product.Here's the thing if you enjoy a game and you yourself see no flaws in it, fine go ahead have fun with the game. But elevating your particular favorite game by s******g on another game of the same genre without a good valid reason is just unfair. I play both games and enjoy them equally as much even though they have particular strengths and weaknesses in certain places.",Fri Jul 16 16:02:51 EEST 2021,662c9372-5ee7-4697-9787-3538754f49f7

Every bad decision, every bug, everything I would hate in a \""normal\"" game, I supported this sack of crap. But enough is enough. Since the Devs introduced \""Skill based\"" Matchmaking (yes, I put that in quotation marks for a reason, we will come to that later), this game went downhill.\n\nFirst of all: DbD was always known for it's wide variety of bugs and it's, at best, suboptimal balancing. Like many other unsymmetric competetive games (see examples like \""Last Year: The Nightmare\"" or \""Prop Night\""), this game clearly favored survivors over the Killer, which was in some way understandable, because the biggest part of the playerbase where some trolley people trying to bully the \""Big Bad Guy\"". Okay, i coped with it and became somewhat of a decent Killer and a passionate survivor for the gameplay was fun.\n\nSecond, the game was constantly changing things that either didn't need any changes or needed different changes, based on what the majority of the community was asking for. A lot of things have been messed up by the devs, without me saying much against it, because I thought \""It is their game, they will know what is best\"" and \""I don't have any choice in that anyway, I'll adapt to it\"".\n\nHowever, the game got worse and worse without me realizing it, because of these thoughts. And now, at the culprit of all, after so many years I accompanied this game, it finally reached the point that even scared me away. And why? The answer is clear: \""Skill Based\"" Matchmaking.\n\nAn obscure way of matching players, that the Devs themselve can't even really explain and / or show ingame, solely based on \""We have our eyes on it, trust us, it works...somehow...\"". In the begining, everything is fine, seemingly. But as soon as you reach a (kind of) mediocre \""skill\"", you are matched with people way over your level that completly destroy you. May it be as survivor or as killer. Sure, there are people that can do it. But these people either play the game 24/7 or are part of the 10% elite that are good enough to beat literally ANY opponent, no matter what. And that is, unfortunatly, hardly enjoyable at all for everyone else.\n\nIf you enjoy putting your efford into thousends of hours into one single game or belong to this 10% group that is naturally talented of killing / surviving at any circumstances, I do in fact recommend this game, as of it's current state. If your are looking for a relaxing, casual or semi-casual experience to just have some fun without beeing forced into a complete sweat-off, you are in the wrong place buddy.\n\nI loved this game for years, but the time has come to move on, I think. Farewell, Dead by Daylight, maybe I will see you again in your former glory...But at your current state, I just can't enjoy you any more.""",Mon Aug 30 12:25:06 EEST 2021,16c54f00-1cb1-4c8d-9cc7-38895a645882

YOu have to relay on chest to upgrade your cards. Guess what you can do... you can buy chests with in game currency you get from playing or buy them with diamonds that you puchase for real money.

Gameplay & Story: 3/10 I waited with my review for the last big patch to hit to see the progress of the game and sadly, if before the patch I would have recommended this game, after the patch I sadly can not. The gameplay consisting of you hitting the enemy quicker than he hits you, using abilities at the right time and individualising your character the way you enjoy it most, has been quite ""broken"" by the patch. Getting Master rank in competetive in just few weeks, I can tell, that even though Hi-Rez states they are knowing what they are doing with the game, the feedback they receive from players after this patch definetely shows they do not. Introducing card levels also introduced ""Pay2Win"" elements to the game (outside of ranked mode), the last patch hit tons of bugs effecting all the modes, like players disappearing under the floor, objectives no getting counted while you stand on the payload or the point, players doing damage after they died, cards not working properly, etc. Most of my friends and clan members quit the game and I trying to wait for fixes, there is nothing left but follow them. Combat & Challenge : 3/10 The competetive side of the game being playing ranked in team of 5 players or alone has been also destroyed by the patch. The balance shifted heavily in favour of some champions, but the real problem of ranked is more the bugs and cheats currently abused in even high ranked matches. And even though the combat itself still stayed fun, there is no purpose behind it anymore, so if you are only for a quick fun shooting some people in the faces, you might enjoy it but long term the drive for becoming high ranked is destroyed since it is all about which side gets most game-breaking bugs and champions. Graphic & Interface : 6/10 The graphic in Paladins is definetely likable and is not effected by the negative touch for the last patch brought live. The characters are fun, animations fluid and all abilities are recognisable. What still is on a level of a year 2010 multiplayer game is the interface in main menu and game mode selection. The whole interface is looking clunky and takes a while getting used to aswell the store feels clunky. The game selection mode hides behind multiple buttons, while in ranked the champion selection could be improved by a lot, even if they would take examples on competitor games like LoL. Progress & Mini-Games : 2/10 The progress of buying more champions and unlocking the cards has also been broken by the patch. Now you have to either farm months to get the cards leveled up on a champion you want to play, or you will get stomped in unranked matches. Obviously, there is a possibility to buy them through the cash shop...The progress in ranked has been destroyed by the bugs and at the moment not good balance. There are no mini-games in Paladins, so not much to value more in this section besides the summary: unranked = P2W or grind for months, while ranked = broken due to bugs and unbalance. Audio & Immersion : 7/10 The audio is something well done in this game, since every hero has a recognisable ability sounds and especially ultimates let you hear who is using theirs. The voice packs give a nice touch to the character and the emotes are sounding fun. Some random chatter the champions are doing is fun to listen to. Audio was and definetely is currently the more qualitatively made part of this game. Side-Notes This game offers multiplayer experience in unranked games with different modes, a dominiation (push payload to enemy base) mode in ranked.This game contains steam achievements and steam trading cards.This game contains Cash Shop items and with last patch, can be considered PayToWin in unranked modes since you can directly buy chests containing cards, that make the abilities of your champion stronger compared to person not having the cards. Summary Paladins, that was a decent alternative to Blizzards Overwatch, being a fun MOBA with nice competetive scene has been ""broken"" by Hi-Rez last patch. Sadly, most players were warning the developer not to bring out the patch to live servers but they still did and it shows their attitude towards their players base. As you can see on recent ratings and reviews, such attitude should be the death of an online game developer/publisher. If the player base starts to dwindle to a matter where they start to listen to a community again remains to be seen.In the current state I can not recommend Paladins to anyone due to technical issues the game experiences, disbalancing in terms of cash shop in unranked modes aswell the attitude of the publisher towards its customers.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game.

Fast-paced, great hero roster, almost all of them have cool kits and are fun adn easy to play. It's relatively balanced and succeeding requires skill. The OB64 update actually isn't as bad as people say it is. It's only hillariously unbalanced and a little pay-to-win if you play Unbound game modes where your character's card levels go from 1-10. You can just play Bound game modes where everyone's card level is set to a maximum and minimum of 4 and it's fine. However, that's where my praise ends.Don't let it's Free to Play status fool you. It's technically free, but realistically $20 if you want to play all the heroes from the get-go. You start with a small number of them unlocked permanantly and a few in ""rotation"" that you can play for a bit and keep your progress for later before they get locked again when heroes rotate. You can buy all of them with ingame gold, but you'll average about 100-200 a match when most of them are 7,000-12,500, which is a lot of grinding. Unlocking them all would take hundreds of hours. Just hope you don't see a hero you like that's not in rotation, spend your hard earned gold on it, then immediately find out you hate it (I did that with my first unlock, Evie). By the time you've bought one or two that $20 pack is going to start feeling like a good investment versus GRIND GRIND GRIND.Speaking of grinding, the wait times between games is much longer than any other online FPS I've ever played. Parts of their matching system is pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Entire games will be dropped regularly becasue some moron forgets to ready up or pick a hero and you have to go back to searching for a game.But here is where my main crticism lies: cosmetics and the ""loot box"" buisness model. I love the cosmetics they make. When they're good they're great, a lot of them are pop culture refrences like turning a tank hero into an anime mecha or turning a sniper hero into bounty hunter Leia from Return of the Jedi. But Hi Rez handles them horribly. First off, pretty much all the cosmetics you can earn through normal play are terrible for how rarely  they drop. Most of them are just minor recolors that you can barely notice. You can technically earn some good ones through spending 'VIP', an alternate currency earned like gold at a MUCH slower rate. Let's say you earn something like 20 a match and 25 more from a daily quest, then some of the skins bought for that cost in the tens of thousands. You'll never realistically get them without spending real money. Their paid currency, ""Crystals"" sometimes drops for quests, but 4 at a time once a day if you even get one. So an uncommon skin that really isn't that good takes about 15 days to grind for, and one of their paid chests takes 75-100 days for a single random set for a single random character.And don't spend real money on chests. Ever. Instead of just simply being able to directly buy a cool skin for a hero you play a lot, you have to pay $5-8 on a chest that with a random chance of dropping a set. So you drop your money on one and you get a skin for a character you don't play or might not even have unlocked. You're paying real money for something you don't want or may not even be able to use. And those chests do drop duplicates, so you may be paying real money for something you already have. Why does Hi Rez do this? Money of course. Keep paying money for a tiny chance at getting something you actually want. There is a reason some European countries are having talks on wheter or not business practices from games like this, Overwatch, and Battlefront II is considered legit gambling.Edit: They are making progress. Some skins CAN be purchased directly, but not all of them. Not even a majority of them. The lootbox system remain FIRMLY in place.The gumball machine loot box system is a cancer on the gaming industry. I cannot in good consience give good reviews to a company that employs such an awful buisness practice. If you don't care about all that, go ahead. Download it and get the hero pack and never look back. You'll still have fun, one way or another.

It's amazing how tactical strategies created using cards to buff yourself/allies or debuff enemies is used to make you stronger or sneakier. It's one those rare shooter games in which strategies can really turn the tide of battle. Yes, other games you can *act* strategically, but with all the customisation in this game, there's a massive difference between shoot everything without a second thought and think before you act. What's more, the characters all have their own unique personalities, some more humoristic than others. My favorite character, Pip, is even more powerful than he is funny. This game is a HUGE recommandation to people who enjoy humour, liked TF2/Overwatch, or don't want to get either games but looking for something similar.

Avoid like the plague, boycot their company, uninstall everything Hi-Rez, and demand refunds for any in game purchases, not even No Man's Sky can compete with this.The wall of text begins here:On a bored lonely evening shortly after getting out of the hospital last christmas from nearly dying I stumbled upon Paladins as a ""Recently added to steam"" suggestion, bored and tired of all my current games I said ""Why not?"" and downloaded it. Lo and Behold, I was instantly hooked, SO HOOKED in fact that I played it every day, morning to till night while I was in post-surgery recovery, and even developed a website for the game that aided players in gaining useful information about champions and loadouts. I played this game religiously and it quickly soared past Arma and DayZ in my ""hours played"" list.Slowly along the way I purchased the founders pack, realm pack, and VIP because I loved this game so much I felt Hi-Rez truly deserved it for giving me the greatest blend of all of my interests, a shooter game, an objective game, and a fantasy spellcaster style game in an arena. It truly was the perfect concoction to me. Slowly I started playing less here and there as I would get burnt out as one always does, but then even still I regarded this game as one of the best things to EVER be put on steam.Then came the news of OB64...No longer would your card loadouts be selected and you would be able to distribute points to upgrade the effects of the card you apply those points to, instead you'd get every single card for free, but the catch is, each card would have individual levels that you don't get to choose to apply upgrades to, instead, you'd have to pay in game money to purchase a chest and get a chance for that chest to drop a duplicate of that champions card to apply levels to that randomly selected card. You literally cannot even spend gold to level up a specific card of your choosing, it's all entirely random. You can also pay real world currency to purchase in game chests which gives literally anyone willing to drop a couple hundred dollars into the game the most unfair advantage imaginable.No longer is this game free to play. If you don't want to get absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing decimated, you have to either have been such a long time player (like myself) that you have obscene amounts of in game currency on standby, or you have to buy into the game to level up a champions loadout and hope that you even get the things that you need leveled in the first place.I am absolutely ashamed that I ever spent a single dollar on this game. I'm even more ashamed I devoted time outside of the game to developing things for the game and it's community who is equally as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as I am. I am beyond disgusted that Hi-Rez not only followed in EA's Battlefront 2 footsteps, but they literally exceeded EA's Battlefront 2 decisions and did something even ♥♥♥♥ing worse... Like literally, how do you top that?I for one, won't stand for it, and I hope anyone that's read this follows suit with me.

It's a matter of taste, I guess.And since the game is free there's really no reason to not give it a try.",Thu Oct 07 15:59:39 EEST 2021,f9b9afbb-54f9-4817-860e-255b9d3b3938

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections. Well worth the buy - even if, somehow, I started playing it in 2018 and only just picked it back up to finish the last two chapters of the game this year.

Nothing feels fun, anymore, as this game slowly becomes a game for damage mains, and nearly no one else. Every character now feels like a damage dealer, if you can't do good DPS, get out of the way. New champions are starting to make themselves feel less and less unique, and less and less fantasy like; almost feeling like they belong in your generic shooter, in addition to many champions feeling extremely lack-luster now. Nerfs feel like they're done haphazzardly, and buffs are bland and generic. Most nerfs are the reduction of mobility and nothing else, whilst buffs are nothing but increased damage.The game used to rely on good positioning and strategy, now it's starting to feel like the game is slowly becoming a game of who can do the most damage first. And this, gets really old, really fast. The addition of the fourth legendary card only helps to enforce this. Most of them go for making a character deal more damage, or making it even easier for them to do damage. While some of them are unique, most of them are really bland, and can easily go. The whole thing of Cards Unbound feels heavily rushed, and feels like there was no care going into the production of this update. Cards Unbound is only splitting the community further than it already is, if ther was a split to begin with, and no one even asked for these changes to the game.EVERYTHING AFTER THIS WAS WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING THE GAME IN LATE APRIL! IT WAS HEAVILY DIFFERERNT THAN WHAT THE GAME IS NOW. THIS IS BEING LEFT JUST IN CASE HI-REZ CAN CLEAN UP THEIR GIANT MESSBeing a lot like Overwatch, this game still holds its place with where it stands, but from what I've seen from playing it, a lot of things still seem to feel rather un balanced and, most of the times, almost cheap. I can't really give this game a positive score or a negative one, as, while it is rather fun, it's almost always infurating to play at times due to not being able to switch the character that you are playing during the match. While some may say that this is a good feature to be having, I think that it's, in all honesty, not that great, due to how unbalanced some teams may end up feeling within the first minute of actually playing.Much like TF2, this game can easily leave you with a sour taste in your mouth. There's no actual voice chat, from what I've seen, and the ingame voice commands feel as if they'd take a good week to learn to begin with. In addition to all of this, the menu itself just feels kinda off, and definitely takes some getting used toIn the end, I still can't really give this game a good review, or a bad review. With the 5 on 5 matches you have, teams can really be unbalanced in the roles of the characters, and with the skill level in general sometime, although, that can still apply to anything. If you've yet to play this game, with what I mean about the unbalanced factors, is that your team may end up feeling like a game of TF2, where you have 8 or more spies on your team. And if you haven't played TF2 enough to experience something like that, I'm honestly rather surprised to say the least. If I were to give this game a score, it'd have to be a 7/10. Mainly due to the balancing that has been put in place, and how unfair it can be. Most games end up being a one-sided match, and that's not fun. I've only played a handful of matches that felt fair for both teams, those were fun.One flaw I definitely see with this game, is character balancing, and hitboxes in some cases. Some characters in this game, in my opinion, ruin the game and only make it fair for the person playing them. These tend to be the flankers from what I've seen. In addition to this, some characters, in general, just seem to be a lot better than others, and make some characters in the game useless, as they can easily counter many characters the game has, and don't really have counters to them.The game is free, and I recomend playing it if you want a fun experience, but you'll probably grow to have a love-hate relation with this game. As some things kill you before you can respond, and some ults don't seem to work the way that they're intended to, which is rather silly (much like the flankers, which I've found one of; in my opinion of course.) This is, again, all my opinion however, so you can feel free to feel however you want about this, and the game itself.",Tue Sep 21 00:48:08 EEST 2021,a8d2f31b-d4cd-4c24-8841-a3e963d487d7

I will say the game runs awesome, if you have a low end PC it will run pretty dam good. It's free so there is absolutly no excuse not to try it out for yourself. I think the reviews are a little inflated, the game is not groundbreaking and does not bring anything new to the table.The card system which allows you to customize very slightly how you want to play a character is very underwhelming, might aswell not exsist in the first place. Along with that the way this differs from games such as TF2 is that before the round starts you can look at the opposing teams line up and pick items that you believe might counter their picks/items. Unfortunatly this also falls very short, the items are boring flat bonus's to damage, healing, mitigation, reduced cooldowns or stealth detection, there are more but really all are very mind numbingly simple which might excite a new player. PRO's + The Matchmaking worked pretty well for the time i tried it, everything went smoothly.+ Game runs really well, they did a really good job at making this game available for everyone!+ The game play is simple and easy to pickup.+ Some interesting characters like Grover, but most are very average. + Play with friends and group up if you like. + Ranked play is unlocked after you gain hours playing 12 characters upto level 4 which teaches people how to play.FIRSTLY - The game uses a Third party launcher, i installed BEFORE i knew this. If i had known it had a third party launcher i probably would not have installed it in the first place. CON's - Unfortunatly the gameplay is too simple, lacks depth. If you like the complexity of games such at DOTA2 this is the complete opposite.  I'm not comparing those games, just putting it into perspective in how shallow the game actually is. - The characters are bland and uninspired, cheap. They are so generic you really don't like any of them, so unlikable. - The maps are very basic. TF2 even has some roller doors that go up and down and some effort here and there, the best way to describe the maps is like playing an FPS inside World of Warcraft style graphics.- The card system needs huge sweeping changes, more risk reward and less passive dribble. - The items you actually spend money on are so ugly. They need more appealing models.- Cant communicate with other team i don't want to be hand held. - Character abilities are also average. Yes, it's not like we haven't seen a bomb go down and everyone needs to run away a million times before.Actually the list goes on, but i will simplfy it for you.Download and try it if you don't mind installing yet another installer and account, you have no reason not to, it is in BETA and things will probably change, but unless it gains depth i wouldn't waste time here. Go play some TF2 if you crave action in a 16/16 server which plays all day with no matchmaking, no waiting and lots of players.I will make sure to edit this review as i play more and as the game changes / grows in time.",Sat Jun 27 11:37:29 EEST 2020,4cca2195-b751-4440-9e76-cdd5f6c48fc6
