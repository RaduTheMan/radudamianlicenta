I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.

I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.

I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees.  I guess if she wanted to, she could coil and spring, flinging herself from one tree to another.  Down here, Mardi Gras ended last night.   My ears are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands.

I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s.  Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious.
