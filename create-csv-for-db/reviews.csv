dd06a2ce-06df-4b03-8ed6-42473828bee1,2,"I would not recommend getting into this at its current state. CSGO has hit rock bottom with Valve's missed promises of game changing updates and their lack of effort to combat the terrible cheating problem. Bugs have been in the game for years and still haven't been fixed. Cheating is out of control. Over the past few years of playing, cheating has gotten worse and worse to the point now where I end up playing against a cheater almost every game. Valve implemented the new ""trust"" matchmaking system to combat some of these issues but its lackluster algorithm still somehow thinks putting me, with years of gameplay and 3,000+ hours, against people playing on brand new accounts makes sense. I really don't know why I still put the effort to play this game anymore because it usually just ends up with me regretting it.

e70949af-1464-480a-a9ed-d7cc6d3ff3dc,5,"I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.",Sun Sep 05 12:08:39 EEST 2021,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank.

5d84f9e7-e0f5-4794-b3a6-bfeb0be742db,2,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",Wed Oct 06 13:44:22 EEST 2021,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)Bottom line is that the community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.The rest of the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥community as you possibly can.6/10year olds.",Wed Dec 15 06:20:35 EET 2021,1ecec3cb-048c-4f0d-b89d-e1a92a3fa773

A small handful of the population managed to seek shelter in the subway tunnels beneath the city. Twenty years have passed, the world has become inhabited with mutants and the surviving population has broken up into various factions.\n \nFeaturing a strong narrative and great pacing, Metro will keep you immersed the entire time. The story is told through eyes of a ranger named Artyom and not through irritating and pacing-breaking cutscenes like a lot of other games. Journal entries can also be found and Artyom serves as a narrator who often talks about the events unfolding around him.\n \nIt’s the direct sequel to Metro 2033 but playing the first title isn’t required to enjoying the game.\n \nMetro Last Light tries to do a bit of everything, it’s primarily a first person shooter but it incorporates stealth elements very well. It also feels like a survival horror at points and can be quite tense when you venture out onto the irradiated surface with a gas mask. The audio is great and the screams of mutants in the distance will always keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a fairly large variety of enemies which are all hideous, unique and well done.\n \nThe atmosphere is amazing, same with the graphics. It’s worth noting that a somewhat powerful computer is required to running Metro Last Light. I was able to run the game at 1920 x 1080 on Very High at around 70FPS average with an Intel i5 3470K Processor, 16gbs of RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 560TI. I have heard that the game does have some issues with certain ATI cards though which can be fixed by turning off Physx in the settings.\n \nMetro Last Light also has multiple endings and plenty of re-playability. It may appear linear early on but it quickly branches out later allowing plenty of room for exploration.\n \nFor a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsPrciV5i2U\n \nMetro Last Light also managed to make our Top 35 List for the best games of the generation. If you’re interested in seeing how it measures up, check out:\n \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196432004\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/""",Tue Apr 06 20:18:21 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps)CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter.Multiplayer:Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.Community:The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages.

25b38151-9d66-4525-8e6b-e6078a3a0424,1,"Let's give this game an honest review.Okay I wanna start by saying that I am a CS series Fan. I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.Community:The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:1. Easter European Children,2. Normal People,3. Cheaters.CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.Gun Balance:Okay this one is good.Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!  Developer Support: After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies.",Fri Aug 28 13:43:05 EEST 2020,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

It annoys me that when I finally have the patiences to sit down and write a review about this game, that it had to be a negative one. I liked this game, loved it at some point, but it has evolved into a monsterious sh*t hole of a game. The updates are just getting rediculous. I have had, give or take, 1600 hours of competitive gameplay done and the ranking system is completely unreliable. I agree with most of the comments that say ""When you reach a certain rank, all you get are hackers."". I've read so many comments on how the community would like for VAC to be better and yet game developers are ignoring this call. Instead, they're making updates of which benefits them ""financially"". Like who in the world said that gloves would be a f*cking great asset to the game and that we needed more things to waste our money on. The game itself is cheap, yes, but the fact that the past updates has been about gaining money is beyond my comprehension. Please fix the game, thank you.Edit: I see now the game has gone Free To Play and implemented Battle Royale. What the hell is Valve thinking? The amount of hackers 10 updates ago were lots but still bareable (around 1 hacker per 15 matches) and now you've gone and opened the doors to them.

On the one hand, the writing is brilliant and many of the characters are colorful and endearing, making some of the stories through the game very moving.

My favorite two involve a Chicagoan widow and a Balkan inventor, who both live in the northeast corner of the map. On the other hand, there are multiple moments throughout the game when the player is robbed of their agency in order to create a \""cinematic\"" experience, and that's the crux of it. RDR2 is equal parts movie and game: each half is done well, but on several occasions the two clash and it absolutely sucks to play in those moments.

The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also.

We have devolved to a state of madness which has eternally damned us in the name of CS:GO. First it was the ridiculous overwatch system, which in itself was not a bad idea. However, when looked at on paper, the abuse potential is amazingly high. Then it was Competative mode, the worst thing to ever happen to counterstrike. Then there was the skin gambling scandal. I would rather have cheaters and griefers in CS:GO than have riciculous overwatch bans and griefer bans.  The update on 10/25/2016 they took tooo far. CS:GO had always been a grey topic for me, but now I publically denounced CS:GO and anyone who is a dev, mod, or manager of it. You sold your souls to this? Are you happy players? Is this what you wanted? 'This game' is a disgrace to what counterstrike is supposed to be about. CS:GO devs, you have committed what is unforgivable. Let's just hope this embarrasment of a game is forgotten in 2022. I have never been VAC, Overwatched, or game-banned.

I still frequently play bot matches or zombies, sometimes with friends, but there is zero online presence now. Even if it was still popular online, it's not worth anything near $60. This game is over nine years old now. There are probably kids younger than this game playing Call of Duty and we're still expected to pay full price for it? This game is worth an absolute max of $30, probably less, and the DLC's need steep discounts too. It is quite literally impossible to enjoy 100% of this game without online play, so why are we still paying 100% of the original price? Activision would almost certainly profit more if they slashed the prices of old CoD games. I love the franchise but I'm sick of this money hungry antics that only work to drive customers away.\n\n*Note: It shows I only have about 90 minutes of playtime.

I may be wrong, but the way they handled its open world is quite straightforward yet feels like too much sweat and tears were shed just to make the vast and wide world of Red Dead feel alive. Take note that this review pretty much focuses on the singleplayer campaign aspect.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\n\n[list][*]⭐ There’s nothing new about the story’s [b]Plot[/b] that we may consider record breaking imo. The execution alone is what makes it perfect. The game doesn’t seem to hold back too much on resources for them to make a blockbuster story. It even manages to have a completely different island just for one chapter despite how huge the main map is.\n\n[*]⭐ There are tons of [b]Content[/b] in the story as to which I sunk around 80+ hours before I actually reach the credits. The game is like a 40+ min/ep TV series you would binge because it has a nice blend of cinematography with a long story split into different parts.\n\n[*]⭐ Each [b]Missions[/b] are properly split per major plot point as the usual Rockstar open world games do except these sets of missions are organized by chapter which helps the player know when’s the time to fool around in the game and do side missions before proceeding to the main story. The side missions are something I wouldn’t guarantee skipping as it helps build up the development of the main character. I honestly think bounty hunting missions, gang honor missions, and only some ‘unique encounter’ missions are the only ones that feel optional.\n[/list]\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\n\n[list][*]⭐ Some may back out on how [i]RDR2[/i]’s [b]Exploration[/b] works as most of the time, players will be riding on a horse. Even if fast travelling exists, we’re only allowed to do so in major towns, cities, or settlements which are generally far apart. What makes exploration fun is how common scripted events are. There’s so many unique encounters in this game that my fingers, toes, and eyelashes can’t count.  I wouldn’t spoil all the them, but one memorable experience was when I saw a horse with a wagon moving on the road, and as it approaches to my character’s side, there’s a corpse of a driver leaning his head downwards with a lot of arrows on his back which was a great introduction to an infamous gang in the late game. All in all, It comes down to personal preference rather than criticism.\n\n[*]⭐ The [b]Controls[/b] are polished to a point that there are hardly any conflicting inputs that would let the character do a different action on a couple of nearby interactables. It may be counterintuitive at first just like in old [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] games, but it’ll soon make sense where it begins to fit like a glove.\n\n[*]⭐ There’s hardly anything innovative about the [b]Combat[/b] besides it being so well done. The flow of the fights was improved compared to the first game as close quarters combat has more fluidity and more executions.\n\n[*]⭐ I would have skipped the topic about [b]Immersion[/b] if it weren’t for hunting and skinning animals for food and profit, doing home chores, gun cleaning, camping, cooking, bathing, eating, drinking, sleeping, hitchhiking, opening doors, opening two-sided doors, getting your hat shot by an enemy which flew away from your head and then being able to pick it up where it literally landed, perhaps also how a gun gets a different animation the longer you use it as the main character gets better at it, and maybe even how the main character has his own dialogue at a dog when he’s drunk… yet here we are.[/list]\n\n[b]AESTHETICS[/b]\n\n[list][*]⭐ There’s no mistaking how amazing the [b]Graphics[/b] are, but it definitely shows its age of the Pre-PS5 era. What makes it jaw-dropping are the amount of scripted animations applied on everyone as it shows characters and NPCs acting as realistically as possible. I could even write a school report of an analysis of the horse’s details alone. It makes horses from other games look like an animatronic.\n\n[*]⭐ Rockstar did well with the [b]Voice, Audio and Music[/b]. The voice actors/actresses perfectly portray their characters with emotions especially the main character. I like how the music only kicks in during horse riding or when a major plot point occurs. Each major scene has its own soundtrack which makes it memorable. Other than that, the audio quality is overall decent and nothing groundbreaking as it is common to most modern games.[/list]\n\nThus, the verdict is an overall…\n[h1]10 headshots out of 10[/h1]\n\nRockstar really hit every mark in this game for me, arguably their best singleplayer yet. If I could pay to experience the game for the first time without getting spoiled, I would. Gladly. If it’s on sale of course.\n\nNow let me have my whiskey while listening to this song knowing that Red Dead Redemption 3 may never come:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh1gCHfYeQw""",Sat Oct 30 04:52:33 EEST 2021,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

3ffdfe50-88ec-4341-b0ea-43e6e287cd02,1,"""Metro Last Light is often overlooked but it’s definitely one of the best games of the year.\n \nSet in a post-apocalyptic Moscow which was destroyed by nuclear war. A small handful of the population managed to seek shelter in the subway tunnels beneath the city. Twenty years have passed, the world has become inhabited with mutants and the surviving population has broken up into various factions.\n \nFeaturing a strong narrative and great pacing, Metro will keep you immersed the entire time. The story is told through eyes of a ranger named Artyom and not through irritating and pacing-breaking cutscenes like a lot of other games. Journal entries can also be found and Artyom serves as a narrator who often talks about the events unfolding around him.\n \nIt’s the direct sequel to Metro 2033 but playing the first title isn’t required to enjoying the game.\n \nMetro Last Light tries to do a bit of everything, it’s primarily a first person shooter but it incorporates stealth elements very well. It also feels like a survival horror at points and can be quite tense when you venture out onto the irradiated surface with a gas mask. The audio is great and the screams of mutants in the distance will always keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a fairly large variety of enemies which are all hideous, unique and well done.\n \nThe atmosphere is amazing, same with the graphics. It’s worth noting that a somewhat powerful computer is required to running Metro Last Light. I was able to run the game at 1920 x 1080 on Very High at around 70FPS average with an Intel i5 3470K Processor, 16gbs of RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 560TI. I have heard that the game does have some issues with certain ATI cards though which can be fixed by turning off Physx in the settings.\n \nMetro Last Light also has multiple endings and plenty of re-playability. It may appear linear early on but it quickly branches out later allowing plenty of room for exploration.\n \nFor a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsPrciV5i2U\n \nMetro Last Light also managed to make our Top 35 List for the best games of the generation.

Its one of the most popular games on steam,and i dont think I have to explain the gameplay so lets jump straight to the pros and cons.Pros:-Many Gamemodes some for the more Casual Minded and others for the hardcore players-Many tutorials online to get started as a newcomer-Timeless gameplay that is fun escpecially if you play it with some friends-Big amount of Community Server if the standard game modes arent something you want-Runs on a toasterCons-Many People you meet (NOT everybody but most of the time) are pretty toxic-Can get frustrating -Valve Anti Cheat is well...not really working. It can happen from time to time that you get some hackers in Matches.-Smurfs/DeRanker and Griefer will destroy the experience often-Updates that debalance the game -Valve is jut intereseted in selling skins and CasesAs a conclusion if you are a hardcore competitive gamer who doesnt fear a steep learning curve or toxic teammates,and you can ignore the hacker/smurfer/griefer every second game.

Metro: Last Light is a spectacular game that perfectally envisions a post-apocalyptic world with its high end graphics and visuals, as well as gameplay. Its story element adds to the overall experience in connecting you deeply with the dark Metro tunnels of Moscow, while being free to some extent to make certain moral choices and decisions to take side paths to explore little nooks and crannies for extra bullets to sell and upgrade your weaponry or just to simply keep your gun loaded up in case of mutant attacks on the path to saving the whole Metro from a terrible war from within the last remains of human civilisation. I found the story absolutely riveting in the constant near misses with death and need for going out of the way to get to a place due to an impassable obstacle. The game felt quite authentic in its harshness, especially with ranger mode activated for extra realism for more hardcore survivalism.\n\nI believe this game literally can place you within the virtual world with the fear of creaping around deadly beasts and sudden onslaughts of mutated creatures from holes in the wall or from within the dark, the need for light or simple nightvision in this game is essential to getting through without being ripped to shreds in the darkness. The music and ambience have been beautifully selected and made for each chapter of the game, adding further connection and deepening the relationship with the environment that you traverse through and over. \n\nI'm very hard to please when it comes to games these days, I use to play anything that looked mildly good but now I keep myself to the games in which true thought and effort have prevaded over the desire for money grabbing and a quick profit. I overall rate my experience with this game as 10/10, that puts it up in the top 10 of my favorite games, a very hard place to get to. I had never touched anything post-apocalyptic or straight out apocalyptic before this, afterwards I went and played a number of of them and have yet to find one that matches the positive experience I've had with this game, none have engage me and kept me coming back and replaying the same story over and over.\n\nThis game is a definite must try game for anyone into games, it'll be an experience unlike that which you will often find nowadays in the game industry.""",Mon Mar 08 16:32:01 EET 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

ffd9cc19-da1c-4e06-8273-95a7b25f759e,8,"The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years:  5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate  entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning.

ffd9cc19-da1c-4e06-8273-95a7b25f759e,3,"This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.The real ranking system:Cheaters on topScammers in the middleLegit players at the bottomAt no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are.

A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.

Valve has shown time and time again for the past 6 years that they could not give one single one about the community matters. Time and time again over this particular game's history, we see them not listen to the community. Honestly, this is the final straw. Nobody asked for Battle Royale, and you can be assured that nobody asked for a free-to-play game. or prime status to all.I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore. I thought getting out of gold was hard before, how about when you can't be sure if that new account really is cheating or not?

26ceb586-d36b-4bba-8ba2-09915e71d0f7,6,"CS:GO is a world famous FPS known for its intense, unique, and deep gameplay and its strong presence in the eSports scene. It's also the game that, at the time of writing this review, I have put the most hours into. It's so addicting, and if you find the right team to play with that communicates and strategizes, is an absolute blast and one of the best FPS games I have ever played.PositivesGreat graphics. The graphics on this game have aged well and look good. They're solid enough to not make you go blind.Built on the Source engine. I've always been a fan of the Source engine. It's very easy to run on any PC, has solid graphics, a deep options menu, which means the game is avaliable to tons of people.Great Gameplay. With smooth movement, unique spray patterns on all the guns, deep strategies gameplay wise and economically wise, ability to move silently, and more, CS:GO's gameplay is awesome. I like it a lot, and I find it very unique. The movement is smooth as well.Everyone is on an even playing field. The skills of a player only rely on their aim, reflexes, and expertise of the game, not XP like in CoD. For example, the other team can't automatically win just because they are all above level 50 and your team is a bunch of level 2s and 3s.Balanced maps. The maps of CS:GO are fine tuned, expertly crafted, and are all unique in their own ways. The defuse maps are constantly updated with tweaks to make them the best that they can be. Some maps receive complete makeovers, such as Train and Nuke, with Dust2 possibly recieving one very soon. The hostage and demolition maps are usually left in the dust as they're underplayed, but they're still solid maps.Operations. These are special events that Valve hold every couple months called Operations. For the price of $7, you can play two player co-op missions with a buddy and get case drops that you can turn around and sell for a dollar or two. Valve also release specially picked community-made maps that everyone can play for free.Community Servers. These servers host custom maps from the workshop. They also host custom gamemodes such as 1v1 and Surf.Skins. I find skins overall neat. While Valve can throw in some ugly and stupid skins, most of the skins are awesome, and are affordable. Some skins range from 3 pennies to thousands of dollars. The only skins I buy are ones that are under a dollar, with my rifle skins being a few dollars. There's likely no way in a million years I'm buying a thousand dollar skin.Gamemodes for both casual and hardcore gamers. While hardcore players will grind competitive defuse for hours a day, there's gamemodes for the casual player too, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, and a casual version of defuse that is easier than competitive defuse.Able to host your own server. While you can buy dedicated servers from various server hosters across the web, you can host your own server off your PC for free by downloading server files directly from Valve, and install custom plugins. I recently started to host my own server for me and a friend where I made it into a 1v1 server. While it's tough to set up, which happens with every server, it's awesome that you can do it for free.MixedToxic community. While there's teammates that are supportive and will communicate and strategize with you, there's also teammates that will insult and harass you if you aren't playing well. They will scream ""He's over there, dumba**! A MAIN!"" in your ear while you're trying to focus on the game. It's insanely annoying, and always gets you killed. Because you died, he'll start a vote to kick you. Screw those toxic POSs. There's teammates that have no idea what they're doing and will run and gun like it's CoD, along with having awful crosshair placement, so they'll be looking at walls when they die. There's teammates that will yell into their mic and act like they're funny. It's a community that's a dense minefield of good and bad, and one bad player can completely ruin your experience.Glove Skins. While I think skins are awesome, I think they're good enough on the guns. Valve have made glove skins, which I rarely see people use. It's just silly to make glove skins while people have been asking for 128 tick servers and a stricter anti-cheat for ages.NegativesVAC isn't the best. While Valve has been fighting cheaters with VAC and the recent creation of the Overwatch system, where specially picked CSGO players can review footage of reported players and judge if they're cheating, hackers are still thriving in CSGO. It's an infamous issue that has plagued the game for ages. While they aren't in every single match you play, they still exist, especially in the higher ranks of competitive.Gambing and Match Betting. Skins have caused negative things to happen that Valve weren't anticipating. People will gamble skins on coin flips and such, which leads into the skin gambling contraversy that exploded not too long ago, and people will bet on matches with skins. It's just sketchy stuff, and has generated some toxicitiy in the CSGO community.64 tick servers. I think 128 tick servers are needed, especially for a game as competitive as CSGO. With all the money Valve has made from CSGO, it's likely that they can update their servers to 128 tick so gameplay is smoother and server-side issues aren't as much of a problem.SummaryDespite all the toxicity associated with the game, CSGO is still a great game in my eyes. It's a unique FPS that I will happily play for many more hours to come so I can hone my skills and become a dominant player.I decided to archive my old review.

I can't believe this is what we've become. There are other things that i have problems with, like competitve skill groups, and the fact that i have met people who i became friends with, but were actually just pretending the entire time, or all of a suddon hate me for who i am. But i think i've said enough. I would give this game 0/10, but because of all the good times i had with people, all the experiences i had in the 300 hours i played this game, i'm giving it 5/10. Would still not recommend playing, but it's your decision.Edit: yes, it is extremely addicting, for me anyway.",Sat Jan 08 07:21:49 EET 2022,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

I love Valve. I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it.",Mon Nov 02 06:12:44 EET 2020,1ecec3cb-048c-4f0d-b89d-e1a92a3fa773

79264bc2-8266-4fad-b6f7-cf2426b61962,3,"Note: This is a temporary review, I'm still pretty new to the game so I'll write another one when I invest/waste more hours on it-My First GameI remember it really well, because it was a game that summed up CSGO almost perfectly. Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.-GamemodesCasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily.Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):MeAmerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensAngry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseAnother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuesSomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vieOther team:Uber SmurfSomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiesSomeone in a partySomeone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a roundAnime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and ScoutUh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui-Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: AKs-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and ArmorCounter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy-Round Two: Some SMG-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and ArmorEco Round?

""B"", ""Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it.You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill.-Rank up SystemCS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.-SmurfingA ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.-VAC System/OverwatchYeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.-CommunityI've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstopUnmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!""Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/Cuties and Hotties (right here)Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the gamePeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of themGrill GamersPeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GOThere are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.-CS:GO Skins and CasesI've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.-Valve/Game DevelopersEh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.-Friendly Aspect to the game?Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.-Overall OpinionIt's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come. Dayum, that was a LONG review, its just that CS:GO has so much in it to cover. It's pretty good.",Tue Jun 30 16:01:21 EEST 2020,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

Well, to begin with Counter Strike is a very unique FPS game.  i first played this game in spring 2013 on and off. i finally think i have enough experience to write a review. Unlike other fake games we shall not name (CoD, BF) this game requires some knowledge and skill to play. Pros:Counter Strike does not require a super beefy computer and can be played with a average set up and hardwareCounter Strike has a ""decent"" community and most players are friendly to the other players (i said ""decent"")Counter Strike is not a pay to win game, you are not required to pay money and keep playing, the Operation passes are to support the devs and help keep the game going.Counter Strike has a growing community and you should be able to find competitve matches quickly (depending on the maps you select)Counter Strike has Dust II, Dust II is the best map every created for Competitive level of gameplay.Counter Strike is not FTP, if Counter Strike was FTP the community would crumbleCons:Counter Strike has had problems with Smurfs in the past, the problem has been fixed a little bit, but there are still some smurf problems. Smurfs can ruin a entire game and i know some players who quit playing because of the SmurfsCounter Strike has some hacker and cheater problems, i have played many games where i have run into a cheater.

ebf66af2-794f-4d8d-b419-950322b679f0,9,"The new revolver is stupid. CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:Sorry about the rant but this update has been rather disappointing xD",Fri Mar 12 19:01:37 EET 2021,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

Only “hubs” that can only be reached by underground are dying.\nThere are tons of streets, squares, backyards, shops and apartments as well as sewers to explore. The possibility to get to inaccessible places via balconies or lifting platforms, to sneak past opponents or just to take a shortcut over the roofs is gigantic. The structure reminds me a bit of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/205100/]Dishonored[/url] only much nicer and much better.  Also the interiors are not quite as copy pasta as e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/704270/]Generation Zero[/url] and make the whole thing more believable. Regardless of which building it is, everything is just completely thought out and extreme attention was paid to all details so that you get the feeling that it could actually be a place in the near future. The game offers immense mobility in the sometimes extremely nested levels, but these are never really confusing.\n\nIn terms of play, Mankind Divided is, in my opinion, more aimed at players who do not necessarily want to shoot their way through the game armed to the teeth, but rather at those who want to penetrate a building unnoticed or secretly want to sneak into an enemy camp and get themselves also take the necessary time for the game. Unfortunately, the game has a few weaknesses here so that it happens that you are discovered, for reasons that are not yet apparent to me, or \""civilians\"" panic simply and for no reason and thus trigger an \""alarm\"".\nAt this point I would also like to briefly note that it is advisable to save the game status more often in the game.

A crazy global conspiracy that's slowly unveiled in a futuristic world of augmentations and crazy tech? FEMA camps are real! Creepy AI! Global geo-engineering projects! Globe-trotting travel! Nope, sorry, none of that here. Enjoy investigating a subway station bombing in Prague for 40 hours. That's literally it. Adam Jensen is an entry-level ATF agent investigating a banal terrorist attack. Spoiler Alert: one bad guy would like to get some legislation passed because it might make the other bad guy's business fail. Seriously? Sorry am I playing Deus Ex or have I accidentally started watching a procedural legal drama? Here and there the writers sort of half-heartedly try to cram in some conspiracy theory illuminati spookyness, but it falls flat and is immediately forgotten.\n\nOther gripes: Hope you like spending 4 hours save-scumming so you can crawl 50 feet without being spotted by guards- that's the entire game now- tedious unrewarding stealth. What else... They made the hacking mini-game somehow even more obnoxious. The pistol is terrible now and silenced lethal weapons are kind of bad in general, so you either have to play sneaky melee or guns-blazing, there's no in between. Inventory management is as dumb as ever and should just be scrapped.

654a5d56-25c9-4be3-a865-fb58851bbbfb,9," Valve Anti CheatOkay Valve. I spent $20 dollars on this game only for it to go free just a year later? I want my money back.I was really annoyed at the time this review was written, so pardon my redundant vocabulary throughout this review.Valve taking advantage of their customersComparable to other greedy f**knuggets in the gaming industry, today, Valve has set the bar up there with EA and Bethesda.You know what Valve, instead of using all that money and resources you got sitting over there to give us, your customers, our long awaited sequels we've respectfully requested since 2004. Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.Valve's GreedYour intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this?The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.EpilogueI can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from.This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated.Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.Here's a clip to summarize my experience in Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveBut tell me what you think. Am I overreacting? Or is what I say pretty spot on?Tell me your thoughts and opinions in the comments below.",Sat Jul 10 18:44:00 EEST 2021,86f49d86-074f-4a2f-88f6-2df9bc277837

A crazy global conspiracy that's slowly unveiled in a futuristic world of augmentations and crazy tech? FEMA camps are real! Creepy AI! Global geo-engineering projects! Globe-trotting travel!

What else... They made the hacking mini-game somehow even more obnoxious. The pistol is terrible now and silenced lethal weapons are kind of bad in general, so you either have to play sneaky melee or guns-blazing, there's no in between.

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections.

Funny thing when they released this whole ""Overwatch"" thing, when you are LEM with 2k+ hours, and there's a Gold Nova 2 with 350+ hours to judge your gameplay if you're hacking or not!3) Really bad gaming community including 12 y.o. kids from Different countries , having 0 knowledge of English. Same happened with older players. Toxic players are no. 2 problem, but I gotta admit, people are Not as toxic as the League of Legends' ones... 4) Really bad servers, with the whole valve giving 0 f***s about it.

79401c02-7616-4525-b421-7d57f5684d6b,5,"First of all I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood but not everything is fine and dandy and I will address some of these issues in my review. First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka:Screenshot of the comment: http://imgur.com/a/i80j3Comment: 'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'My Response: 1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).  6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game.

I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more.However, I have to play this game:1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance, 2. There's something addicting about being british and joining a game and speaking with an accent,3.

Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments.

5e27937f-b7be-4097-a66b-0c70b24f1272,6,"Well hi and thanks for stopping by.After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO.If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull.What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more.",Mon Apr 19 21:25:04 EEST 2021,1ecec3cb-048c-4f0d-b89d-e1a92a3fa773

Metro: Last Light is a spectacular game that perfectally envisions a post-apocalyptic world with its high end graphics and visuals, as well as gameplay. Its story element adds to the overall experience in connecting you deeply with the dark Metro tunnels of Moscow, while being free to some extent to make certain moral choices and decisions to take side paths to explore little nooks and crannies for extra bullets to sell and upgrade your weaponry or just to simply keep your gun loaded up in case of mutant attacks on the path to saving the whole Metro from a terrible war from within the last remains of human civilisation. I found the story absolutely riveting in the constant near misses with death and need for going out of the way to get to a place due to an impassable obstacle. The game felt quite authentic in its harshness, especially with ranger mode activated for extra realism for more hardcore survivalism.\n\nI believe this game literally can place you within the virtual world with the fear of creaping around deadly beasts and sudden onslaughts of mutated creatures from holes in the wall or from within the dark, the need for light or simple nightvision in this game is essential to getting through without being ripped to shreds in the darkness. The music and ambience have been beautifully selected and made for each chapter of the game, adding further connection and deepening the relationship with the environment that you traverse through and over. \n\nI'm very hard to please when it comes to games these days, I use to play anything that looked mildly good but now I keep myself to the games in which true thought and effort have prevaded over the desire for money grabbing and a quick profit. I overall rate my experience with this game as 10/10, that puts it up in the top 10 of my favorite games, a very hard place to get to. I had never touched anything post-apocalyptic or straight out apocalyptic before this, afterwards I went and played a number of of them and have yet to find one that matches the positive experience I've had with this game, none have engage me and kept me coming back and replaying the same story over and over.\n\nThis game is a definite must try game for anyone into games, it'll be an experience unlike that which you will often find nowadays in the game industry.""",Sun Jul 05 05:45:41 EEST 2020,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it.

But the point of this review system is to let people who haven't bought it know about what they're getting in to. That's why I don't recommend it. If you jump into casual to learn the ropes and play with other people there's a 90% you'll get kicked because you don't know how to play, didn't defuse the bomb because you don't know where it is, or maybe you'll get kicked just because someone called a vote for no reason and everyone hit F1 because it's a funny me me to kick people for no reason. You'll get abused over mic and text chat constantly until you ""git gud"", and then even when you do it will still continue.If you play competitve to try and get better and progress through the skill ranks there's a 90% chance you will get yelled at continuously if you are last alive, pointing out everything you do wrong in their eyes, even though they are already dead.This games community is absolutely terrible and while there are nice people that just want to have fun or help out new people, they are a dime a dozen.If you think you'll be fine with all this go right ahead and buy it, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling when you can play, and even moreso when you do those pro™ strats™. But for new players this is an awful game that continues to insult you until you don't want to play anymore, it's happened to more than a few of my friends that tried to get in to it.Overall, great game if you persist, terrible game if you want to jump in to it casually",Mon Mar 15 05:35:38 EET 2021,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb
e67db36e-c1d8-42de-8912-c297eace8c53,7,"""One thing that surprised me about Metro LL is that it's very much a horror game.  More frightening, more throat clenching and heart pounding than any game I've tried out that was supposedly a \""scary\"" game.  Whether you're walking through radioactive swamps filled with strange creatures, in the moonlight amidst ruins, travelling in claustaphobic tunnels, or (my favorite) deciding to walk into dark doorways off the main path... this game is freaky as hell.  You can go guns blazling, you can do stealth attacks where everyone in a building ends up dead by your hand without an alarm raised, or you can actually play through the whole game without killing any human beings.  Each method is rewarding, and I found myself using each of them depending on the situation.  \nI could go on about this game endlessly, but the main thing is that you'll need a powerful gaming PC to enjoy this how it's meant to be experienced.  If you don't have enthusiast hardware, I definitely don't recommend because it's just going to lag and ruin the atmosphere.  This needs at the minimum a GTX 670 or AMD 7950, the system requirements they posted are laughable.""",Mon Apr 26 11:18:38 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more.

But I kept coming back, as it was very interesting.\nGameplay-wise, it's the same as previous game, with very few additional mechanics. You can play lethally or non-lethally. You can go stealth or full-assault mode. \nThe visual side amazing. Everything looks very detailed, locations are beautifully designed with a great attention to their functionality. I was often going around stunned by the quality and huge quantity of unique assets - all the fake posters, ads, books, items. Every little appartment had some visual story. The costumes are outstandin. The developers did a really great job creating an illusion of a functioning, future world.\nNow, what's bad. First of all, story and locations. There is one big hub city (Praha), very nicely designed (a lot prettier and interesting than Detroit!) and you come back to it after main missions. Apart from that there are 4 more other locations connected with main quests - and 3 of them are quite bland. I think there should be more memorable places (I can recall more emotional bits from DXHR that I played a few years ago that this part, played a week ago). The story seems a bit short and compressed. I was surprised that many characters were there just for one task or moment and didn't return later in game. It feels that many plotlines are not resolved. There is just one \""boss fight\"", in the end, and you can end it in a few seconds. Watching the trailers, after playing whole game, I think that some concepts, places (ie. Rabi'lah) and characters were introduced to play a much larger part, but they were scrapped later. The game could have also offered a few more dramatic moments, with characters important for us. Wasted potential? Also, it's a shame that the DLC missions are not integrated with the main game - even thought they would be perfect side missions to gather more xp and equipment.\nAlthough there are achievements for playing non-lethally and without turning any alarms on, the developers didn't include any indication if you still have \""clean\"" account, sadly. One glitched body or camera may cancel all your effort and you won't even know where you lost it.\nTo sum up, the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has technical issues, crashes a lot, its story is interesting but short and feels unfinished with many loose ends and unused characters. The game world is beautifully designed, with attention to details, and the gameplay with stealth mechanics is as good as before (or even better, with a few more options). \nIf you're not easily discouraged by crashes and you liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution, give it a go.""",Sat May 29 03:04:27 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

Couldn't type anymore.So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad. FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :DBut don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) ",Sun Aug 16 09:17:32 EEST 2020,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done.

I knew about the movies with Clint Eastwood, but never watched them.\n\nNow, this game took 8 years to develop and the result is an absolute masterpiece in gaming history. It does not matter if you are interested in western stories or not. The characters in this game are so well written, that it feels more like an interactive movie series that will suck you in completely. I bought RDR2 because I like the GTA series. A game published by Rockstar Games just must be good (at least I thought so before the Definitive Edition of the GTA Trilogy was released).\n\nHowever, RDR2 is a lot more darker and serious than what you would expect from the GTA series. This makes the story and also the gameplay more realistic and this realism connects the player more to the game, its world and its characters. The player does not have much influence in the game world, or in how the story will proceed and end, but it is the details that makes this game so great. It depends if you are a good or bad guy. This will have an influence how people view and treat you. People will remember you, and react according to your prior actions.\n\nApart of the interactions, the ingame world also offers a lot to see and explore. Not a single corner looks like another. The map is huge and full with details and even wildlive. There are swamps, mountains with snow, deserts, forests, lakes, pretty much everything you can think of.\n\nBut even if you just focus on the main story missions and may do some extra missions here and there, you can easily spend at least 50+ hours before completing it, unless you try to speedrun it of course. I can only suggest you to take your time and enjoy this game as long as you can. When finishing it, you will wish you could play it again without knowing what happens.\n\nThe graphics are obviously spot on. What you see in the preview screenshots is what you get. Actual ingame footage, no pre-rendered nonesense. Details like clothes getting wet, muddy, or snowy if the character was on the ground, can be seen and appreciated. Guns can even get dirty and must be cleaned. Day/night cycles and weather effects look amazing. If you have a gtx1080 or better, you can play it on max settings without any problems. The game itself is also very robust. I did not experience any frame drops, crashes, or graphical glitches.\n\nIf you ask me what I don't like about the game:\nThe online mode is lame and grindy. There are more currencies like gold and other nonesense. Also you get more money/gold if it takes you longer to finish a mission, which was obviously designed to slow down the players. But nobody wants to repeat the same missions 100 times to get a certain gun, clothes or licences (to be a bounty hunter for example).\n\nBut anyway, it is a great game and I would highly suggest trying it out!""",Thu Oct 17 22:33:15 EEST 2019,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

6ebb85ac-dbe7-4bbc-9c0c-1743f322da35,6,"""Most. Immersive. Game. EVER.\n\nYou'll see what I'm talking about when you end up in a destroyed bridge, trying to hide from demons and nosalies, while cleaning the blood from your gas mask and counting the seconds to change your air filter, so you don't choke to death. And if you think this is bad, wait untill you reach the catacombs, where you will constantly hear the noises of footsteps near you, and when you think you are reaching the exit, your lantern stops working, so you must use your crappy lighter to illuminate the walls (considering how good the light effects are, this is really tense).\n\nI am a big fan of the first game, Metro 2033. I was excited when 4A announced Metro: Last Light. Now, after beating it, here's what I have to say:\n\nUnlike the first game, M:LL is not that hard, which, in my opinion, is not a good thing. Of course, it's not bad, but the high difficulty was one of the things that made Metro 2033 shine. I've rarely had problems with ammo or filters. You now have 3 universal weapon slots, at first I thought this was a bad idea, but it actually works pretty well.\n\nThere were some things that got better, while other were changed to make the game a little easier. Yes, I'm talking about your watch. It's not as good looking as Metro 2033's watch, but it still act as a real watch, which is nice. The timer showing how much air you still have is WAY simpler, instead of colors and pointers, you now have a simple timer showing the time in minutes and seconds. In my opinion, this change was good, because know you must manually change your air filter, which increases the immersion.\n\nWeapons can now be modded. There are not many different mods to buy, but at least you know have something else to spend your military ammo. Most guns from the first game appear in the sequel, like the Bastard and the Helsing. There are new guns too, like the Sniper Rifle, and the awesome Gatling Gun (it's extremely hard to find one, and you can't reload it, so you can't keep it for too long, but it's fun to use when you want to kill everything in front of you without releasing the trigger)\n\nThe graphics are... I have no words to express how beautiful the game is. My only complain here is regarding the animation, the characters are a little stiff, they don't move too much, but considering that 80% of the time you are alone, and the only humans near you are decomposing and/or being devoured by mutants, that shouldn't be a problem ;)\nThe voice acting in english is okay, but here's my advice: play the game in russian with english subtitles, it sounds way better.\n\nWell, this is it. Some things are better, others are worse, but it feels like a true Metro game (an easier game, I must add).\n""",Sun Jun 13 04:58:10 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Only “hubs” that can only be reached by underground are dying.\nThere are tons of streets, squares, backyards, shops and apartments as well as sewers to explore. The possibility to get to inaccessible places via balconies or lifting platforms, to sneak past opponents or just to take a shortcut over the roofs is gigantic. The structure reminds me a bit of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/205100/]Dishonored[/url] only much nicer and much better.  Also the interiors are not quite as copy pasta as e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/704270/]Generation Zero[/url] and make the whole thing more believable. Regardless of which building it is, everything is just completely thought out and extreme attention was paid to all details so that you get the feeling that it could actually be a place in the near future. The game offers immense mobility in the sometimes extremely nested levels, but these are never really confusing.\n\nIn terms of play, Mankind Divided is, in my opinion, more aimed at players who do not necessarily want to shoot their way through the game armed to the teeth, but rather at those who want to penetrate a building unnoticed or secretly want to sneak into an enemy camp and get themselves also take the necessary time for the game. Unfortunately, the game has a few weaknesses here so that it happens that you are discovered, for reasons that are not yet apparent to me, or \""civilians\"" panic simply and for no reason and thus trigger an \""alarm\"".\nAt this point I would also like to briefly note that it is advisable to save the game status more often in the game. If you are looking for archivements, it will be much easier for you.

(Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!Neutrals:(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.",Thu Dec 23 03:48:26 EET 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

5633be3e-9b9e-4cd7-85c8-3699bcd155ee,9,"""A cowboy game that really lets you horse around, pun intended. Unless it's the story missions. \n\nTL;DR: It's really good, but the gameplay is at odds with the story, which could have probably been shorter. \nIf you like wild west media in general or open world games, it's definitely worth a try even if you are just going to mess around and not finish a story(only 20.3% of people did on Steam actually). \n\nVisually, it's (mostly) beautiful, especially considering how huge the open world is, with some worse textures here and there. A lot of care went into animations, the cutscene animations are especially worth mentioning, and many little details that make the world seem more lived in. Apparently horse balls shrink in the cold, but as I am not weird, I haven't actually checked.  Though admittedly, being an 2018 game, it's showing some age. \nIt's also worth mentioning that game uses checkerboard-rendering, which causes visible artifacts in hair and fur. The only solutions are to either use TAA(which makes everything blurry and makes it look worse) or much higher rendering resolution. The DLSS isn't that amazing in this game and makes the hair artifacts worse.\nSound-wise, I have nothing wrong to say about this, everything is essentially perfectly spot on.\n\nThe gameplay by itself is good, though dated with some more immersive elements like looting animations or skinning or animal as well as some survival mechanics such as eating. The survival mechanics are pretty shallow and really more for some immersion like I said or minor roleplaying.\nWhat also helps roleplaying is really wide array of customization options - hair, beard(both growing in real time) or clothes. And boy, there is a huge variety of clothes to choose from as well, so you can play the cowboy dress-up game too if you want to.\nThe world is beautiful, with a lot to hunt and explore. It has quite a few side story missions that are usually pretty funny and nice diversion from the main plot. \n\nThe story is about a gang of more noble outlaws during the ending years of the Wild West, as the country was becoming more and more civilised. The fact that you can't fight the progress and change is a large thematic part of the game, whether it's the the law trying to end the outlaw life, or the gang itself being against old values such as slavery.\nIt's well written for the most of it, but sometimes characters killing 40-50 people during as story missions feels really off for the kind of story it's trying to tell. Other times there are some AWFUL story conveniences that are just straight up irritating with villains escaping in awkward manner. \nThough that did sound more negative than positive, the story is definitely worth experiencing, though could probably be bit shorter to be paced better.\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer component, as I heard it's pretty grindy and I already have an actual job, so yeah.\nIf you can buy it on sale, which is lately usually 50% off, it's a really good deal. I don't think I'd want to pay 60 for it.""",Fri Oct 22 14:59:14 EEST 2021,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games.Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun.BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"".After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others.You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review.I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?!I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do.To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers.This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve!And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"".So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system.This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture.You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins.This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame.By the way:Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system.Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days....",Fri Oct 29 19:51:54 EEST 2021,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

I hate the fact that I can't play the game right now because their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little servers are down.

They literally take the apple approach to performance issues with the game, instead of helping you optimize the game, they'll recommend going to a technician to help optimize the game and spend money there, coz the money YOU give to buy the game doesn't include tech support.Fifth, though this can be included in performance issue, but there's times when the game will straight up freeze upon seeing an enemy or wont register hits even if you empty the whole magzine on their faces.Only get the game if it is a gift or it's on sale, it doesn't worth the full price.Review update: Right after I wrote the review I got ""some"" hacks which would help me aim and wall. And played till I got VAC ban which is for 250hrs and going from SEM to LEM, being a waller myself, I can gaurantee upon that atleast 50% people have vision assist of some kind and atleast 30% have some kind of trigger/aim assist. I wanted to prove that anyone can hack easily in this game, even with free hacks, which I used and can play for longer periods of time undetected.

When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the ""season pass"".  You set what the market will bear.

c7449eab-e9e0-4680-964a-0b8593cca3a3,10,"I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: Pistols desperately need balance. Netcode and servers are horrible.VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience.",Thu Dec 03 11:29:22 EET 2020,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

8f35f303-740d-4308-a711-31915f438bdc,7,"""I have a lot of mixed feelings on whether or not I recommend this game. \n\nGuess it's a good thing Steam doesn't have a character limit.\n\nStrap in kitties, this is gonna be a long one. \n\nDestiny 2 is a solid FPS, with mixed mechanics that are also interesting. The abilities are cool and the amount of customization for armor and weapons is pretty stellar.\n\nI played both Destiny 1 and 2 on Xbox and just recently ported to PC so my husband and I could cross play together. I have more than likely over 1k hours in both games and personally, I don't think I've spent much actual money in the Eververse store. \n\nThe game is much more interesting and fun than COD or Battlefield and IMO for newbies to FPS games, its a great beginner to the genre. \n\nThere is huge story telling in this game with character arcs and beautiful locations with enemy factions that keep you engaged. \n\nAll this being said...if you are reading this review, you probably are new to Destiny right? Right.\n\nSo here's the issue. \nThe story of Destiny is rich and in-depth. But it has a fatal flaw which is NONE of the original story content is in the game anymore. Yup that's right, that trailer you saw that brought you to this page? Throw it away, because all that content has been vaulted. \n\nThis means that you literally are locked out of story content from two years ago and you miss out on narrative context, lore and character arcs that are pretty critical if you want to give a damn about the story and the people. \n\nThe worst part to all of this? All of us who are still playing years later, paid for the content that doesn't exist anymore. \n\nPeople like me, who put the game down sometimes because life happens, have missed so much content and I'm sitting here grinding to finish a DLC that will also be vaulted in two months time. \n\nThe stripping of content leaves new players confused and honestly uninterested in whats happening in the game because they have no idea of where their protag came from, their values, etc. Instead, the game thrusts you into whatever the tutorial is (which I believe is taken from Destiny 1) and then boots you to Earth where you join Guardian stronghold and can start going on missions. \n\nThe game is a grind, and there are so many events that you'll feel like if you put it down, you'll miss something really important. Which can be damaging to people who have irl commitments. \n\nThere are playlists in the Crucible, that offer experiences with other players. There are seasonal events as well as endgame content. There are also bounties, triumphs and challenges to keep you busy. There used to be a lot more you could do and unfortunately with the new DLC coming out, there is more going away. \n\nI have a love-hate relationship with this game and I personally will continue playing even though I am bummed that the story content that I purchased the game for is gone. \n\nAll I can say is, if you don't mind revolving content that eventually leaves the game and you just wanna come in, shoot some baddies and maybe team up with friends, you'll probably like this game. If you actually care about characters, story and lore, ehhh, you may want to skip this one or at least wait until the new content is released so that way you don't have to rush and finish old content before its gone.""",Mon Feb 22 22:07:25 EET 2021,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

There is no balance to this, you will hardly ever find a good team that you enjoy playing with.Maps - There may seem like a decent selection of maps to choose from, but there are only a select few which actually get played, and those are the old maps which most people have played thousands of times so it may be hard to get into, you may even feel discouraged.Not P2W - This game isn't pay to win, there are only weapon/glove skins which are purely cosmetic or different knives which ultimately all do the same thing, there has been a lot of controversy in the past about this kind of system being available to kids, there are cases where children steal their parents credit card just to buy skins.Many of the recent updates over the past year or so have been garbage, with many maps being added which almost never get played after a week, along with glove skins and other items so that valve can make money. I feel like this game has been abandoned by the developers, and now they primarily use it as another way to make easy money, completely disregarding the loyal playerbase and professional players.Smurfs (an experienced player using a new account to face lower ranks) and hackers are a pretty big problem in this game, and despite valves many failed attempts at combating the issue almost nothing has changed. Valves anti-cheat is garbage, and if you do end up getting this game, I would reccomend either faceit or ESEA, because their anti-cheat is a lot better and you generally face better players than if you were to play regular competitive.Although this game used to be a lot of fun to play competitively with friends, I can not reccomend it in it's current state, in my eyes this game is dying and after putting just over 1000 hours into it, I am ready to never play it again.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)",Sat Jul 24 07:48:32 EEST 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

The immersion and atmosphere in this game is breath taking. I felt like I participated in a lot of ways in the world of metro, a living and breathing world. This is easily one of the prettiest games of 2013 on PC (I played it on Ultra High settings). Ukranian developers sure did prove that the FPS genre isn't just gunning down hords of faceless enemies and unlocking \""bad-ass warfare\"" that makes you feel like a mini army. Personally, I rate this game a 9/10 (it would have been 10 if the ballancing on Ranger Hardcore mode was a bit better and for the linearity in general of the game).\nPros:\n>Satisfying gunplay, customizable gear and upgrades\n>Rich lore and great story (You need to play Metro 2033 in order to fully grasp it)\n>Great companions with nice backgrounds (Khan, Pavel)\n>Stunning visuals and tense horror scenes\n>Great stealth\n>Different approach to the FPS genre\n\nCons:\n>Ammo is way to scarce on Ranger Hardcore mode (even with tons of exploration)\n>Lack of hud in switch menu is annoying (When you want to switch from blades to grenades, molotovs etc)\n>Boss battles can't be done with stealth (Like the rest of the game, you can even avoid beast fights)\n>Few bugs here and there but nothing too much to ruin the feel of the game.\n\nA must own!!!""",Tue Jul 20 13:10:15 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving.

Not just in Silver league, where people either troll constantly even if you're top fragging and you're the only one actually trying, hacking or smurfing from much higher ranks.Every game makes me angry. I play against LEM smurfs, Globals smurfs, even the good ol' Silver Elite Master smurfs who still manage to destroy everyone. I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts. Nothing I have said so far has been hyperbolized, this is actually how the game is now.Hackers not getting banned. Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry. Next thing you know you're being body blocked all over the place and the only thing you can do is beg for a kick. I don't even have 200 hours on this account yet and the past 20-30 have been nothing but the same puerile crap. 30 year old adults acting like babies. At least the 12 year olds, even with the squeaky voices and diametrical tempers, actually try to win. Every time I log on, I have a positive mindset and feel like both having fun and winning. Then I meet the 3 types of players I just talked about. Not to mention that after the game is over, you're glad because you get the part ways and play another game with other players that won't give you a hard time. Oh wait, no you don't. You get matched up with the very same players over and over again unless you take a 20 minute break to ensure that you truly meet other players. And the cycle continues.This is not fun. If you already have the game, can't say anything you don't already know and agree with. If you're looking to buy it, don't. Go play some games that are actually worth your time. Don't think for a second you'll get the same games and players you see on the pro players' videos on youtube, because you sure as hell will not. This game is no longer enjoyable. I know that I am bad and that's why I'm not Gold Nova let alone Silver 3. But at least I actually try to play the game, to communicate and teach the basics to the ones that are new to this game. How many reports have I sent out for griefing? And how many have been dealt with? I'm more than confident that the answer is not a single one. Buy the game if you want, I obviously can't stop you.

Only “hubs” that can only be reached by underground are dying.\nThere are tons of streets, squares, backyards, shops and apartments as well as sewers to explore. The possibility to get to inaccessible places via balconies or lifting platforms, to sneak past opponents or just to take a shortcut over the roofs is gigantic. The structure reminds me a bit of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/205100/]Dishonored[/url] only much nicer and much better.  Also the interiors are not quite as copy pasta as e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/704270/]Generation Zero[/url] and make the whole thing more believable. Regardless of which building it is, everything is just completely thought out and extreme attention was paid to all details so that you get the feeling that it could actually be a place in the near future. The game offers immense mobility in the sometimes extremely nested levels, but these are never really confusing.\n\nIn terms of play, Mankind Divided is, in my opinion, more aimed at players who do not necessarily want to shoot their way through the game armed to the teeth, but rather at those who want to penetrate a building unnoticed or secretly want to sneak into an enemy camp and get themselves also take the necessary time for the game. Unfortunately, the game has a few weaknesses here so that it happens that you are discovered, for reasons that are not yet apparent to me, or \""civilians\"" panic simply and for no reason and thus trigger an \""alarm\"".\nAt this point I would also like to briefly note that it is advisable to save the game status more often in the game. If you are looking for archivements, it will be much easier for you. A manual saving before you have reached your destination, for example, at which a conversation is triggered, has the advantage that if you screw it up and thus the side mission is not triggered, you can simply do it again.\n\n[b]Before you hack something[/b], you should always make sure that nobody is really around and can disturb you. The ambient noises are almost completely faded out during a hacking process and if you are then attacked by someone, it will be canceled immediately.\n[u]Regardless[/u] of the smaller weaknesses like one or the other logic error and the sometimes unwieldy controls, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is in my opinion an [b]excellent game with numerous (secondary) missions long playing time and a great replay value.[/b]\n\n[b]Jensens Storys:[/b]\nThe digital deluxe version also includes the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/470070/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided_DLC__Season_Pass/]Season-Pass[/url], which in my opinion is completely unnecessary except for the two story DLC's [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413360/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided__System_Rift/]System Rift[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413370/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided_DLC__A_Criminal_Past/]A Criminal Past[/url], which come up with further side missions and achievements\n[b]If you value the story and the \""complete package\"", you should only play the expansions after the main story has been completed.[/b]\n\n[b]Breach:[/b]\nApart from the main story, there is also the breach mode. As far as I know, this is available [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/555450/Deus_Ex_Breach/]separately and free of charge[/url] on Steam and is already integrated in the Digital Deluxe Edition at Mankind Divided.\n[b]But there really isn't a story here.[/b]\nBreach is basically pure gameplay in a virtual environment or in a computer program or, to put it more simply, a pure hacking game in which you have to steal data cores and infiltrate networks.\nCan be fun and is a good change from the main game. \nUnfortunately, Breach has an [u]online compulsion[/u] that you cannot avoid.\nThose who collect achievements can be happy if they have Mankind Divided and Breach in their library. If you have played Breach e.g. in Mankind Divided, then start the independent game and link your email address, all (previous) successes pop up there without having to play😉\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]MY PROS AND CONS:[/b]\n\n✅ very large scope\n✅ detailed and large levels\n✅ insane atmosphere\n✅ several routes / walking paths possible\n✅ Freedom of decision / action\n✅ exciting side quests\n✅ varied gameplay\n✅ good story\n✅ good overview\n✅ Cool augmentations\n✅ New Game +\n✅ great replayability\n\n❌ Finale without resolution\n❌ AI with small dropouts\n❌ partly unwieldy controls\n❌ long loading times when changing parts of the city\n❌ Breach online duty and microtransactions\n\n[hr][/hr][b] PLAYED WITH: 🎮  📺[/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/][b] ⮩ CHECK OUT ALL OF MY REVIEWS [/b][/url]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[url]https://store.steampowered.com/app/337000/[/url]""",Tue Jun 15 01:48:13 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections.

I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates.

e8f0b788-12fc-492d-8704-82c763116fa2,6,"The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.",Fri Jun 18 07:07:45 EEST 2021,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot.Graphics 8/10The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.Sound and voice acting 10/10Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the ""Terrorists Win"" and ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYET"" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!Game physics 8/10Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)Community 6/10Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH!

0dbc7b69-37fa-4682-a213-4ccdde22fc77,2,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical competitive first person shooter.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.

I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank. If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned.

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Fri Nov 26 01:57:18 EET 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

The FOV is fixed, at 45 vertical (~70 horizontal). It actually works a lot better than you'd think, but if you get motion sickness from narrow FOVs, you may want to reconsider.\n3. The best way to play this is on Normal Mode, Hard Difficulty. Also, make sure you set your gamma as recommended, since it adds even more depth to the atmosphere.\n\nNow, on to my recommendation.\n\nMetro: LL is easily the one of the most engrossing single-player games I have ever played since Half-Life 2. If you're the kind of person who can immerse himself in a game world and can make time for the small details, you will absolutely love this game's outstanding visual and sound design.

Even if it might seem balanced, you only get to play a ""balanced"" game 1 every 20-30 games, and even then there's a pretty high chance you'll end up with one of the following people: a retard, a russian who doesn't speak english, a troll, a hacker.The rest of the games are either 16:1 in your favor, or 1:16 against you. And trust me, the ones you lose with scores like 10:16 are the worst games, cause this game TRULY gets the best out of you. For instance, if you play for about 3 hours CS, you'll need around 4 to let the tension this game creates blow off. It's unreal!

You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform. Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player.Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything.You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings.At it's core CS:GO is a solid competitive team FPS with a lot of gameplay depth, good map pool, active playerbase and lots to learn and room to improve yourself. There's just many little pitfalls. I think a lot of people will end up spending more time on this game than they initially expected. I don't know if I'd recommend it.

928aa85c-18d4-4b89-8c33-6b289ce1af48,4,"After several hours in this game, all I can say is that this game has the absolute worst community I have EVER SEEN in my entire life, and worse than Call of Duty's, Battlefield's, PAYDAY 2's, Team Fortress 2's, or Left 4 Dead's.CS:GO's community is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the gaming community.You get insulted by either your teammates or the enemy team for EVERY little thing, on Casual, and ESPECIALLY in Competitive, and you can't mute them either because you have to somehow find some useful information that's buried underneath the childish and immature insults from these manchildren and kids that love talking♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't physicallly punch them in the face in real life because of distance.The virginity, girlfriendless, sexism (I've seen really immature and horny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that prey on girls, and I've also seen stupid, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attention seeking girls on this game as well that bait guys), anti-social, fanboyism, nerdism, sociopathy, childishness, manchildishness, and immaturity are at maximum here in this game.Then there's these clutch or kick nerds that can't ever give you a ♥♥♥♥ing chance and are constantly pressuring you and cause you to fail, then they put up a votekick against you and kick you out for losing ONE round even though you're most likely leading and carrying the entire team, and winning the match as well, and it's worse if you're in a Competitive match when this happens because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown system, which is another issue with this game. You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so goddamn much to you.And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community.",Tue Mar 23 00:21:55 EET 2021,62a6899b-550d-45d7-b4cd-3329be85e915

This also applies with kids - I don't know, how many times I heard 11/12 yo kids who f*cked my mother, funny :), isn't it? You can have a good score, like 36/15, you can win 9 rounds on harder side, you can sacrifice your soul to win, but still, with team score 14/9 on better side you can LOSE. Why, because they aren't able to do something good. Situations, when they want to kick you:They want to kick you, if you don't clutch 1v5.They want to kick you, if you don't speak their language.They want to kick you, if you are 30 seconds AFK. They want to kick you, if you are ahead of them.They want to kick you, if you are behind them. ( mostly if  they use only P90)They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun.AND STORY CONTINUES........I really recommend to find a friends and play together.SKINSIn game you can buy skins. Nice, you can ""upgrade"" your game how you want. But there fun ENDS. Do you want some beauty skin on an USP? - Pay about 5€!Do you want some beauty skin on M4/AK47? - Pay 10+€!Do you want some beauty skin on an AWP? - Pay  20+€!NOT ENOUGH?

VALVE's RANKING SYSTEMAnother thing you should know until you start play competetive. Believe me, rank in this game doesn't show your right skill. There are a lot of boosted accounts. You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.VALVE ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM (VAC) Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets. SMURFSMaybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man. So, you want check out his profile, clearly for sure and then you see: Lvl 1 profile without avatar, only with 1 game - CS:GO with about 60/100 hours on it. I don't get, why do they create new Steam profile, buy CS:GO and play against weaker players. They gotta to kill lower ranks to get a higher ego?

This game's monetization is out of hand.\n-the game's monetization is very bad, with the dlcs it will cost about 200$ to keep up with the current grind, not to mention the season passes you have to buy to gain certain activities, not to mention the other deluxe editions and silver. and also the game is free-to-play so it can put up microtransactions to buy with destiny 2 silver that can't be received without buying it.\n2. The lack of long-term content.\n-the long-term content (which is what i call it) is boring/enraging/repetitive, any order and combination counts. the PVP is made to attract players to play the game more, but its currently the biggest cancer since its a bit of a no-brain fuck fest. with the amount of broken weapons being abused and amount of sweatlords that ruin your chances of getting loot in trials and ruining your enjoyment and you have a very cancerous tumor in the game, gambit is fine with teammates you can coordinate in, but that is irregular and not worth a lot for playing full time. and alot of good content to play, is behind a pay wall.\n3. The game's lack of story\nthis one is not as big of a problem than the others, but the lack of a story for new-comers (or a pile of confused mess) is a bit off-putting hence not giving them interest in the game in the immediate moment.\n\nwith the game's glaring flaws it does have good things.\none is that this game is a gold mine for people who are really interested in special, unique weapons and lore-hunting, to worlds-first raids and community events, this game is made for people heavily interested in this game (myself included), the game has certain fun missions for the people who grind hard or play \""for fun\"", and even a volley of new things on the way for dedicated players to enjoy, like witch queen and its new crafting system. overall this game is a mixed back, because its target audience is very specific, thus not having a lot of people interested in it, but those who are, are awesome and one of the most dedicated and most fun people I could ever find ever (ex. CBGray, Sweatcicle and some other lfg raiders) and it's  a very fun community to join (except those apes in crucible) but the flaws are still there and should be noticed and fixed or changed in some form. \n\ni give it a 7/10\nits great but some things need to be fixed, and they need to give us more than just a few updates to beyond light and a giant pay-wall\n\ntl;dr\nthis game is too expensive, but its fun and addictive""",Sat May 30 13:29:38 EEST 2020,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit.

But I kept coming back, as it was very interesting.\nGameplay-wise, it's the same as previous game, with very few additional mechanics. You can play lethally or non-lethally. You can go stealth or full-assault mode. \nThe visual side amazing. Everything looks very detailed, locations are beautifully designed with a great attention to their functionality. I was often going around stunned by the quality and huge quantity of unique assets - all the fake posters, ads, books, items. Every little appartment had some visual story. The costumes are outstandin. The developers did a really great job creating an illusion of a functioning, future world.\nNow, what's bad. First of all, story and locations. There is one big hub city (Praha), very nicely designed (a lot prettier and interesting than Detroit!) and you come back to it after main missions. Apart from that there are 4 more other locations connected with main quests - and 3 of them are quite bland. I think there should be more memorable places (I can recall more emotional bits from DXHR that I played a few years ago that this part, played a week ago). The story seems a bit short and compressed. I was surprised that many characters were there just for one task or moment and didn't return later in game. It feels that many plotlines are not resolved. There is just one \""boss fight\"", in the end, and you can end it in a few seconds. Watching the trailers, after playing whole game, I think that some concepts, places (ie. Rabi'lah) and characters were introduced to play a much larger part, but they were scrapped later. The game could have also offered a few more dramatic moments, with characters important for us. Wasted potential? Also, it's a shame that the DLC missions are not integrated with the main game - even thought they would be perfect side missions to gather more xp and equipment.\nAlthough there are achievements for playing non-lethally and without turning any alarms on, the developers didn't include any indication if you still have \""clean\"" account, sadly. One glitched body or camera may cancel all your effort and you won't even know where you lost it.\nTo sum up, the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has technical issues, crashes a lot, its story is interesting but short and feels unfinished with many loose ends and unused characters. The game world is beautifully designed, with attention to details, and the gameplay with stealth mechanics is as good as before (or even better, with a few more options). \nIf you're not easily discouraged by crashes and you liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution, give it a go.""",Sun Aug 15 10:58:51 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

Just look up a few Youtube videos that recorded some arguments on CSGO):1) Mr. L33t, the egotistical, temperamental♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who blames everything on you or other teammates-People like Mr. L33t think they're good. They're ones who feel entitled to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because they think their skill will win the game anyway. Imagine the following scenario, okay? Here it goes: you're playing a match defending a bombsite on the Terrorist side. Mr. L33t is carefully watching the bombsite's right flank as a sniper. An enemy player suddenly appears, who also has a sniper rifle. Mr. L33t and the enemy player try to one shot each other. Since you don't want to peak the sniper and get killed insantly, you hang back at the bomb site and play it smart like your other teammates. Mr. L33t, on the other hand, wants to get that kill so bad that he ends up getting sloppy. Then Mr. L33t dies. Soon enough, you end up being the last living member of your team, and you're still hiding. Meanwhile, the enemy team also has only one member after all the fighting.Now, you know this guy has a sniper rifle, so you ain't going to peak. Of course, there's a problem. He can approach you from multiple sides. You have two choices to approach this situation:A: You can take a risk and look for him, and if you're lucky enough, kill him. However, the downside to this decision is that if you end up dying, Mr. L33t will say ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE CAMPED!B: You can continue hiding in the same spot and hope to ambush them. However, if the enemy player has a good guess that you're hiding in that spot, he will prefire the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and kill you. If you die, Mr. L33t will say something along the lines of ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE PEAKED AND LOOKED FOR HIM!"" Or he will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you for not prefiring, even though if you did, you would never have hit the enemy player and instead give away your exact position, so even though the enemy player had a guess of where you're hiding, now he knows for sure. So which choice is the right choice? None, because you never had a chance to kill him in the first place and would die regardless. Meanwhile, Mr. L33t will be busy telling the whole team to join his circle jerk of hate, because clearly you are a bad player for not being able to kill him.You could, of course, tell Mr. L33t that if he were such a good player, he would have killed him long before it even became a problem, but it's clearly not his fault because he's the most important snowflake on this team. And remember the last round he tried to clutch as the last player? Yeah, he didn't clutch that match either, and he did far worse than you at it, but he decided to ♥♥♥♥♥ at his teammates anyway for not giving him proper call outs, even though that's exactly what you did. What did this guy do? He didn't give you ANY call outs. You know what's worse than playing on a team with Mr. L33t? Playing a game with 2 or more Mr. L33ts. Let the vote kick commence, but it's not like having them kick you off the team will make any difference because they're going to lose the competitve game anyway.2) Mic Spamming Mikey, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound loops, songs, memes, and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS in a comp match who wonders why the team can't hear any callouts.You would think Mic Spamming Mikey is a troll, but unlike other mic spammers, Mikey is taking this game half-seriously, so he's putting in some effort to win, although it's not much, mind you...Basically Mikey thinks everyone enjoys the BS he ♥♥♥♥♥ out of his mic, because listening to his stupid songs that have lyrics like ""touch muh wang wang"" and ""I'm so fresh you can suck muh nuts"" are clearly more important than listening to callouts. Nobody's going to be able to hear call outs with loud volume like that. Then comes the moment where a teammate dies, then Mikey says ""OMFG HOW COULD YOU NOT HEAR THE CALLOUTS? VOTEKICK!"" It's even worse if Mikey turns out to have the same personality traits that Mr. L33t has.3) Jackass Jimmy, the idiot with no sense of awareness.Jackass Jimmy isn't a noob. He's been playing this for a while. However, he still plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so he has absolutely no excuse to be an idiot. Jackass Jimmy still doesn't know call outs, recoil patterns, the difference between camping and rushing, and a whole lot of other obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥that you need to know. Jackass Jimmy is the type of person to hear someone say ""They're rushing B! They 're rushing B!"" and still stay at bombsite A because he doesn't know how to read a map. He's the type of person to fire a gun full auto at point blank range and still not kill his intended target. He's the type of person to buy an auto sniper, only to miss every shot with it and give the enemy team a generous donation of an OP weapon after getting killed.Jackass Jimmy isn't even trying at this point.4) Trolling Tommy and Backup BillyTrolling Tommy likes to troll competitive games just to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. He'll do anything to get on your nerves, whether it's purposely playing like♥♥♥♥♥♥ getting in your face to keep you from using your gun, flashing your teammates, ""accidentally"" teamkilling you, spinning around in spawn, and a whole list of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Naturally, such behavior warrants a quick and hasty votekick, but not for Trolling Tommy. You see, Trolling Tommy always comes with another equally stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥called Backup Billy. Backup Billy also likes to troll the game, but he prefers to blend in with the crowd and act like he's not part of it. Backup Billy's job is to keep Tommy from getting votekicked, so he'll always vote no. He'll lie and tell you he voted yes, then blame it on someone else.5) Hacking Harley, the hacking piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from the enemy team who keeps you from winning.In most circumstances, hacker accusations are unfounded and usually are wrong. However, in cases where there clearly is a hacker in your competitive mach, Hacking Harley just loves to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with their aimbot, wall hacks, spinbot, whatever. Forget having their team votekick them. Those guys want a quick and easy win. Enjoy losing a competitive match that could have easily been won by you if everyone played fair and square.6) Mr. SaltyMr. Salty has a temper like Mr. L33t, but Mr. Salty doesn't brag about how good he is. Instead, he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over trivial things. He will team kill his teammates for accidentally shooting him, making the whole team lose the match. He'll get angry at you for trying to give him advice. Mr. Salty is the type of person who has been on a losing streak in the past couple of matches so anything will♥♥♥♥♥♥him off.

d9002f8b-bba8-4b41-9a08-7875c6dbbdcd,6,"Thanks, Valve! You did it,you ruined CS:GO,something I thought was impossible.   Why would you make a BR game out of this iconic franchise is beyond me.You could have just made a second br game using source engine and put another dev team on it,insted you focused your resources on a mode that nobody asked for.   Danger zone plays and feels like an indie battle-royale,cs mechanics feel weird and out of place in a genre like that.Also most of the time youre using SMG's ,pistols and shotguns which,in my opinion,lowers skill ceiling drastically.On top of that - map becomes boring and repetitive after a few games because it looks like its made in 2007 with first stable source build valve released.Last operation was over a year ago and all this time youve been working on this?!?!?Why?WTF...Valve always values community feedback ,for example - overwatch,reddit,forums,workshop etc. , but this time nobody asked for this,if anything, people were sceptical.So why would you,in a right state of mind,start working on something so controversial and uncharacteristic to cs as a god damn BR...   Now about prime and CS:GO becoming f2p...♥♥♥♥ valve.Cheater problem was bad as it is,but now since you can buy prime cheaters are going to ruin even more games because nothing stands in their way,and I dont even want to imagine all the casual PUB's which are gonna be unplayable.Even if you get eventually detected,you can simply make another account and continue cheating,there is completely 0 penalty for doing so.    This company built all this hype around a terrible update.I was hoping for Matchmaking rework,introduction of seasons and rewards,something fun ,a goal for the casual players,maybe 128 tick servers or an operation because valve was working on something BIG...Now its all gone,they are going to focus on BR  mode,update and tweak it.Because of that cs as we know will stagnate even more and eventually  perish.Thanks for spliting your dev team even more,i look forward for the next update in 2022.Thanks volvo :)RIP CSGO 6/12/2018goodnight,sweet prince...",Wed Nov 11 17:01:32 EET 2020,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

Considering i don't like dystopian futuristic settings in any medium be it movies, novels or video games, the devs deserve credit for pulling off a big feat here. The world they created is so realistic and so are its problems, you can look at the present world and this fictional future and it looks totally believable and relative to our own problems nowadays.\nWhen it comes to gameplay. Stealth, this is as good as it gets, to put it simply there are so many ways to approach a situation that every one can have their cup of tea.\nThis particular game has pretty short main campaign but the amount of side content makes up for it in my opinion. Which also in my opinion belongs to 'highest quality side content' section of RPG rankings. The side quests perfectly fit in the world and the conflicts that the main campaign is dealing with seamlessly. The characters are so well written and unique, the writing overall is pretty good.

Source use to be fun when you hop into a server and you may or may not find the random a$$hole, but most people where very accepting and use to actually have great conversations and great games...but now its full of intense competitiveness that just makes people upset if you don't do exactly what they tell you when they tell you, even if you do what they tell you they will figure out a way that its still somehow your fault and not theirs at all.I do like competitive, but people (and trolls) need to lighten up. I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game. Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community.UPDATE 05/10/2016:The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same. Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it.UPDATE 09/30/2016:I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people.UPDATE 11/12/2016:Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all.

You're better off buying ANYTHING ELSE but this terrible time waster. I know this review is long, but it's been a small reminder over the last 9 months of on and off play to just stay away, the only reason I keep coming back is just a time filler. Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games. I still personally don't recommend this game, but if you choose to buy it, have fun I guess :PUPDATE 09/07/17:Literally trash. Would though away if I could.

If you are motivated and invested you can only progress and DAMN it's satisfying to see yourself progress and be able to do more and more complicated things!\nFor the PVP don't expect quality, the servers are still in the Middle Ages in peer to peer, the matchmaking is often not fair. But if you are patient and persistent the gameplay Destiny 2 offers is very satisfying, for example by landing multiple headshots with a sniper or winning a duel by baiting the enemy's senses, bouncing a grenade off a wall to hit an opponent behind the cover and a lot of other cool stuff. \n\nFor the lore enjoyer: the story of this game is deep, meticulous, every little detail, every little enigma, nothing is left to chance.\nHowever, reading and following the story can be complicated as you have to collect and search for every little detail in the game. Hopefully there are databases on the web and youtubers such as: [u]My name is Byf[/u]\n\n\n\nMisc: third party websites make your experience on the game more fun, smooth and can give other objectives as well, here are some of them: [url=https://destinyitemmanager.com] DIM [/url], [url=https://bray.tech] bray.tech [/url], [url=https://www.light.gg] light.gg [/url], [url=https://raid.report] raid.report [/url]\n\nFor example my favourite activity in the game by far, are raids. Here's my [url=https://raid.report/pc/4611686018483009096] raid.report [/url]\nThe website displays your record of all the raids you have done or left, they have a badge system and speedruns, completions ranking, between all players. (Worldwide ranking)\nChallenge seekers will be served: three man, two man or even solo raids that are normally done with 6 players. Finish them without any player dying, etc.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, after more than 5k hours on this game, I haven't managed to collect all triumphs, farm all godrolls of each weapons, main all characters with all subclass because Destiny is constantly evolving and that can be the biggest advantage as well as the biggest disadvantage at the same time.\n[b]5k hours and I still haven't stopped so what are you waiting for?[/b]\n\nI hope this has been helpful, most importantly have fun.""",Mon Oct 04 00:38:25 EEST 2021,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Sat Jan 01 11:22:28 EET 2022,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

d93dd580-ad4f-4b58-ae66-6ba5e903f0e0,9,"""Destiny 2 still going strong 4 years after release. In fact, it is probably better than ever with its balancing, new features and content updates. The community is very dedicated and passionate about this franchise and the player count is still very healthy, peaking at about 70k players every day (keeping in mind that there are a lot more console players).\n\nThe game is set up to have a one big yearly expansion that usually brings a new raid, destinations and large story expansion; and 4 seasonal smaller updates that bring new activities, dungeons and continue with the story narrative. So you need to shell out about $100 a year to keep playing. New content keeps coming and the old content is getting sunset. You will not find the same activities that were available last year, or the year before. There is definitely an element of FOMO and “you had to be there”. On the other hand, these older activities lose their popularity over time and the number of activities may seem overwhelming for new players. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nDestiny is kind of like an MMO, but not really. Instead it is basically a co-op looter shooter. Everything revolves around guns and getting them sweet god rolls. Every activity in the game is designed to be played many, many times. While the first few runs are definitely cool and exciting, after a 100th clear you question your sanity. Do I even need a gun that badly? Is it worth it? Sometimes it isn’t, yet we still grind for it. Sometimes the gun won’t even be used, but it’s just nice to have it for the collection. This gameplay loop is not for everybody and the majority will not see the point.\n\nBut it doesn’t need to be like that. You may choose to play an activity just a few times, be satisfied with subpar gun rolls, and just play until it becomes a nuisance. Ultimately, you can play just for the new content. Being primarily a PvE game, Destiny will live and die by the new content. Right now Bungie made a 3 year commitment to yearly expansions, which may or may not expand past that. Once there is no new content to play through, I don’t know how the game would keep going.\n\n[h1]Lore[/h1]\nThe storytelling is probably one of the strongest parts of Destiny. The theme of light and darkness is a familiar narrative but the history of all that happened, the background behind all the lore, it is all very detailed and interesting. There is an overarching metanarrative that spans from Destiny 1 along with the smaller pieces in the seasonal format that push the story along. \n\nA big problem is that none of this is well explained to new players. If you are just starting the game, you will have no idea what the story is, who the people are, what the point of anything is, what to do next, none of this is explained. You need to do your own research if you want to know any of these things. There is a great YouTube channel called “My name is Byf” that has been covering all the lore of Destiny for years. I highly recommend his “Complete Story of Destiny” video to get caught up. \n\n[h1]PvP[/h1]\nThe core gunplay in PvP can be very fun. But just like in any ability heavy game, there are often times where abilities and supers ruin your game. There are issues with balancing, there are often guns that release too hot and take a while to nerf, there is a big hand cannon meta, but overall it can be fun at times. The ranked system as it stands currently is a joke. It has potential to be good but it needs a major overhaul.\n\nIt feels like it has been years without a PvP content update. Recently Trials have been reworked and made more accessible for all players. Ability/super cooldowns have been reworked for PvP. It feels like a foundation is being set up for future updates. We need more game modes and a ranked rework. Bungie has confirmed they are still committed to PvP, we just have to wait and see.\n\n[h1]TLDR[/h1]\nDestiny 2 is a great game that is hard to recommend. The story narrative is fantastic and the gunplay is very engaging. The gameplay loop becomes grindy and repetitive, it turns into a nuisance after a while. For new players the game is very confusing. There is no clear indication of what to do or what the story is. It takes a long time to catch up. The endless grinding for god rolls is probably not that exciting. Ultimately the game is what you make of it. When it becomes tedious, it is always good to take a break and come back once the new content is out.""",Thu Oct 21 18:57:29 EEST 2021,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

THe developers of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game do not give two butt♥♥♥♥s about the players, they care only about money. Instead of making this game better and fixing bugs, they add cases and sprays. At times, I question why I I still play this god awful excuse of a game. The one great thing about this community was the ability to gamble your skins, and ecspecially csgolounge. Not only did valve attempt to fully cease operations on gambling sites, they also took down csgolounge, the biggest and most reliable betting site of them all (also a personal favorite of mine). On top of these horrific displays of costumer servive by valve, they also have a ranking system that is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow that i could litterally rank up faster in the actual U.S. military. And dont even get me started about the god damn morons you find in matchmaking. I often find that 99 out of 100 of my teammates that i am randomly get queud with are absoulutely brain dead, and have little to no knowledge about the game and how it functions. Now on to a very important issue that is troubling our community, the grill (girl) population is extremely scarce, you could imagine my frustration as a man trying to get in some dank phone sex after a compettitive match. Not only this, but it seems as though the grills that are playing csgo, 1. pay no attention to my extremely rushed and desperate advances toward them. 2. grills also seem to be treated like gods in this game, (even though they are all really ♥♥♥♥ing bad) and almost always have extremely expensive inventories. And on to my final issue with this game, the man who runs the show.... yup, thats right, im talking about you Gaby boy. Gaben, also known as gay piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥fan boy obese nerd online legend real life loser-having♥♥♥♥♥Gaben has slowly destroyed this game, due to the constant uploads of new cases and operations, just so that fat bastard can get some more cash from twelve year olds around the world. GABEN DOES NOT CARE HOW ANYONE FEELS ABOUT THIS GAME, he doesn't want to improve it he just wants to keep making money, and no one is stopping him. When you think of the world's richest people, you would never think that some dumb♥♥♥♥♥obese pizza face online fangay that happens to be named Gaben would be on that list, but right now Gaben is a very powerful man, and mark my words, he will make his way to politics and put more money in his diseased sausage finger having♥♥♥♥♥hands.

As a soft reboot to the original series, you don’t need to play the older games in order to enjoy this one. With that said, the previous games are canon and do explain some bits and pieces as to why the Doom Slayer is so enraged and keen on killing all the demons. I recommend a quick recap of the previous stories to fully understand his character. \n\nI initially came for the gameplay but found myself so enriched into the lore that I didn’t want to leave long after beating the game. I wanted to read all the testaments, codex, the different demons and their backstories. It’s all here I was amazed at how much was available and yet I could choose to never be taken out of the action and just obliterate everything in sight. This is what I call genius in the making.\n\nFrom the gameplay to the music I can go on and on, but would still do it injustice. Once you boot up the game, get the feel of it and start running around, jumping from one area to another wreaking havoc while headbanging to the music, plus add in the crazy rich lore and you will understand why Doom is one of the best games to have been released this past decade.""",Sun Dec 05 22:33:11 EET 2021,f08e39ac-76ac-4179-80b1-22fac794c1dc

a763a883-3615-4cdd-96b1-eb420ab66fc8,8,"Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10.",Tue May 25 18:16:43 EEST 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

dc1e8393-bdee-4336-b51e-dec7fbd69cac,10,"The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first. ",Fri Sep 24 03:49:34 EEST 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f
dc1e8393-bdee-4336-b51e-dec7fbd69cac,3,"I cannot recommend CS:GO.Valve lacks adequate transparency in rectifying the ongoing issues present within CS:GO (i.e. cheats, game play performance, etc.). Additionally, the crawl to level 21 (i.e. a requirement to play prime account matchmaking, which slightly decreases cheating encounters) is grueling given that the number of cheaters in non-prime results in slowed leveling; competitive matchmaking consistently provides the highest XP reward, which is dependent on rounds won. Valve relies on a peer review system (i.e. Overwatch) to punish potential cheaters, which serves as a do-it-yourself solution that is supplemented with VAC (i.e. an ineffective anti-cheating solution). Cheaters are not deterred as an overwatch conviction commonly results in the individual obtaining an alternate account. Despite Valve’s profit margins being nourished by superfluous additions (stickers, temporary graffiti, skins, music kits, etc.) the game has been lacking substantial content in the form of Operations, which are accompanied by new maps. The previous operation occurred almost a year ago, which far exceeds the average time between the last six operations of five weeks. Also, the gaming community is vitriolic - there are countless incidents of bigotry, griefing, etc. – it's a Sisyphean struggle of always wanting to expect the best out of CS:GO before being unfailingly reminded of its shortcomings. After nearly 1000 hours, I was left exhausted and resigned myself to the rampant cheating - I piecemealed together my own cheat using articles from numerous public forums. Expectedly, this resulted in me being overwatch banned after countering a series of cheaters in competitive prime-matched games. This 'other side' does not provide any reprieve - even the slightest tinge of a perceived good play, whether assisted with cheats or not, provokes the veiled hackers. I give up on this game as Valve has long before me.tl;dr                                                         …………………./´¯/)                                                        ………………..,/¯../                                                        ………………./…./                                                        ………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸                                                        ………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\                                                        ……..(‘(…´…´…. ¯~/’…’)                                                        ………\……………..’…../                                                        ……….”…\………. _.·´                                                        …………\…………..(                                                        …………..\………….\… CS:GO Excessive number of cheaters primarily in matchmaking (i.e. indistinct or outright) Lack of substantial content (e.g. 1+ year to release an Operation); however, Valve will occasionally release minor fixes for the existing map pool whether aesthetic or technical Ineffective anti-cheating engine and DIY stopgap (i.e. Overwatch) Vitriolic community and ineffective counter-measures Placebo buttons (i.e. report text / voice abuse)   Low incidence of griefing convictions   Heroes of the Storm adopted an effective abuse system a few months after release – Introducing New Reporting Options and the Silence Penalty[us.battle.net] - why is CS:GO lagging behind?We view any system that generates revenue at the cost of consumer happiness as a broken system that we need to fix - Kyle Davis (Valve) - In-Game Economies in Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 Steam Dev Days 2014 A common occurrence in CS:GO [image.prntscr.com] ",Wed Sep 01 04:17:02 EEST 2021,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

The story itself kept me hooked from beginning to end and without giving any spoilers, has few intersting twists and turns in it.\n\nThe gameplay was a pleasant suprise for me personally. The wide range of guns keep things interesting. But the game mechanic that make bullets and currency one and the same really makes this unique. Essentially you buy guns, upgrades and special weapons all with bullets. The human enemies in the game are pretty easy to stealth by and also not to much of a challenge in a full on gun fight. Its the mutated creatures you fight in the game that will give you a run for your bullets (see what I did there?) Some will take entire clips to take down while others attack in groups making it extremly difficult to aim. \n\nOverall this game suprised me with its story, graphics and gameplay. All without any real bugs to speak of in my own play through. Pick this game up and enjoy the Metro. :) 8.8/10""",Fri Oct 29 16:33:54 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Cheating:There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!2. DDOS-ing:I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!3. Smurfing:Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!4. Patches:Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!6. Community:The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.Over all:Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!",Wed Dec 08 04:05:33 EET 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

A crazy global conspiracy that's slowly unveiled in a futuristic world of augmentations and crazy tech? FEMA camps are real! Creepy AI! Global geo-engineering projects! Globe-trotting travel! Nope, sorry, none of that here. Enjoy investigating a subway station bombing in Prague for 40 hours. That's literally it. Adam Jensen is an entry-level ATF agent investigating a banal terrorist attack. Spoiler Alert: one bad guy would like to get some legislation passed because it might make the other bad guy's business fail. Seriously? Sorry am I playing Deus Ex or have I accidentally started watching a procedural legal drama? Here and there the writers sort of half-heartedly try to cram in some conspiracy theory illuminati spookyness, but it falls flat and is immediately forgotten.\n\nOther gripes: Hope you like spending 4 hours save-scumming so you can crawl 50 feet without being spotted by guards- that's the entire game now- tedious unrewarding stealth. What else... They made the hacking mini-game somehow even more obnoxious. The pistol is terrible now and silenced lethal weapons are kind of bad in general, so you either have to play sneaky melee or guns-blazing, there's no in between. Inventory management is as dumb as ever and should just be scrapped. You earn a pitiful number of praxis points but there are 3000 augmentations- You end up being paralyzed by choice and never spending your points, or dumping them in abilities to grow to regret.""",Wed Oct 13 04:42:01 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else.

4d68f26c-7535-4f72-aeff-d2e35aa5daa2,5,"Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive",Sun Jan 10 19:56:42 EET 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

But I kept coming back, as it was very interesting.\nGameplay-wise, it's the same as previous game, with very few additional mechanics. You can play lethally or non-lethally. You can go stealth or full-assault mode. \nThe visual side amazing. Everything looks very detailed, locations are beautifully designed with a great attention to their functionality. I was often going around stunned by the quality and huge quantity of unique assets - all the fake posters, ads, books, items. Every little appartment had some visual story. The costumes are outstandin. The developers did a really great job creating an illusion of a functioning, future world.\nNow, what's bad. First of all, story and locations. There is one big hub city (Praha), very nicely designed (a lot prettier and interesting than Detroit!) and you come back to it after main missions. Apart from that there are 4 more other locations connected with main quests - and 3 of them are quite bland. I think there should be more memorable places (I can recall more emotional bits from DXHR that I played a few years ago that this part, played a week ago). The story seems a bit short and compressed. I was surprised that many characters were there just for one task or moment and didn't return later in game. It feels that many plotlines are not resolved. There is just one \""boss fight\"", in the end, and you can end it in a few seconds. Watching the trailers, after playing whole game, I think that some concepts, places (ie. Rabi'lah) and characters were introduced to play a much larger part, but they were scrapped later. The game could have also offered a few more dramatic moments, with characters important for us. Wasted potential? Also, it's a shame that the DLC missions are not integrated with the main game - even thought they would be perfect side missions to gather more xp and equipment.\nAlthough there are achievements for playing non-lethally and without turning any alarms on, the developers didn't include any indication if you still have \""clean\"" account, sadly. One glitched body or camera may cancel all your effort and you won't even know where you lost it.\nTo sum up, the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has technical issues, crashes a lot, its story is interesting but short and feels unfinished with many loose ends and unused characters. The game world is beautifully designed, with attention to details, and the gameplay with stealth mechanics is as good as before (or even better, with a few more options). \nIf you're not easily discouraged by crashes and you liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution, give it a go.""",Thu May 20 16:02:26 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

32475cac-0164-4ae7-a144-4dedc94cc04e,7,"I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team.

If you're gonna read this just know this isn't written completely out of spite, it's just my way of rationalizing how such a decent game can cultivate one of the most horrifyingly sadistic and brutally toxic communities I have ever seen in my 18+ years of gaming.Well, here we go...If you value your time, self-esteem or general sanity, I advise you stay as far away from competitive as possible. Stop. Don't bother. Save yourself the heart condition and stick to casual. Or don't play at all, that would be the optimal choice. This game is a test of character, not just a test of skill, and I will tell you why.This game splits everyone into one of 3 categories of player, the one who is bad at playing but can learn and improve, the expert player who harrasses and belittles all others for not being good enough, and the trash players who votekicks and teamkills reguardless of target or skill. This, of course, is nothing new and is pretty common in all online multiplayer games. The harshness of this game, however startlingly eclipses all other communities I have ever seen, creating a sinkhole of reason and leaving everyone with pure hatred not only for the opposite team, but every single person on their own team.You see, like the snake that consumes it's tail, all players that stick with this game end up reaching the second archetype, who in turn become the harrassers after all the hostility they put up with. They go and become the average player in the game, maybe a youtuber, who baits others into trying the game and constantly filling the quota of targets to harrass and belittle. It's a self sustained cycle that has slowly ramped up since the game first came out in 2012, which I can attest as I have been here since the beginning (my hour count doesn't reflect this, so it doesn't relate).That's not to say this is a bad game, no no no. It's just that the entirety of the community is toxic and spiteful, with about 3/4 of them (a generous measurement I'm sure) that WILL sour the game for you. On the other hand if you somehow fit into this description, then by all means try your luck. I promise you your newly found anger management disorder will find a perfect home in your life.If you've made it this far you're either intrigued by what I've said thus far, or you are skipping to the end to see my point. Well either way here it is:If you really want to play this, whether it's for a friend or personal interest, stick to the casual and more open game modes, otherwise I guarantee that you will not like the outcome. Even if you do decide you like it, you will reach a point where you reassess what you've experienced, the community you've exp[osed yourself to, and eventually decide whether you want to put up with this anymore. It'll be your loss, but also your lesson.",Sun Mar 21 16:25:12 EET 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

Here's what I have to say about GO...CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim.

Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.

502d68ad-35c8-480b-974a-c12eaf8522c7,10,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any enjoyment out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't touchy teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are vastly outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be impossible to do so if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire (which you will see a lot of), I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature almost every time. I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time and the veteran players aren't going to stick around forever, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.Another issue is that in the update cycle for this game, things often end up even more broken than repaired. As of right now there are some serious problems with frame rate drops and hit detection, which you probably imagine would take the highest priority on the developer to-do-list, but no. Skins, cases and all other forms of micro-transactions always take the highest priority. I appreciate that Valve is a business and that their goal is to make money, but nobody is going to stick around to play a broken game when they eventually get fed up of it like I and so many others have. We paid for this game and it is your duty to maintain it and make sure everything works like it's supposed to! On one final personal note, I really wish that there was some kind of option to disable skins in-game and maintain only the default models. They're bloody ugly and ruin the immersion, but this is only a personal gripe.The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community and poor maintenance.Update: As of January 2017, I decided to try playing this game again to see if things have gotten any better. I'm afraid not, it's still in poor condition, hit detection is even worse and the community is still as toxic as ever. But hey, at least the cash-cow is still flowing in the forms of ""Glove Cases"" now, right? Sigh...",Tue Oct 19 09:57:04 EEST 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

Now i downloaded from tbp Metro Last Light because i didnt trusted new developers (thq bankruptcy and other company bought franchise). It was really epic, atmospheric game like the first one so I bought it.  Big improvments like stealth so you had much more otions how to win this game. Great graphic improvments and little details made this game master piece for me. I really liked outdoors. They were more common. The most fun feature that wasnt in Metro 2033 was Boss fights. It was really fun and very challenging in Ranger mode. No ammo just running and mleeing that boss to death. Level desing was very impresive just like ing books.

The lower end players the brand new players tend to buy game hoping to have fun and get trolled all the time.

So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open. So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game.

f992ba66-6e12-4791-beaf-c75fa885d02c,6,"Counter Strike - a huge franchise from Valve, I mean who hasn't heard of the countless streams, case openings and wizardrys all around this game, right? As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad. Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into? People getting CRAZY about chargeable SKINS that only aesthetically make a difference? You tell me.Anyways, enough of that crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ opinions are opinions, right?Controls are okay, graphics don't matter anyways, teamplay is strong, skill is required, what else to say? I think there are enough reviews about the actual game mechanics other than the critizised points listed above, so let me be your hero and skip that part.

f992ba66-6e12-4791-beaf-c75fa885d02c,1,"So, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive... here we are.I have owned this game for over a year and haven't really started playing it until recently.My first impressions of the game were that aiming made completely no sense and that I couldn't understand what a single location call out meant period. I soon left CS GO to go back to other games I was playing at the time such as Dota 2 (another Valve game that has tons of hats) and H1Z1 (a game that has tons of hats because it wants to be like Valve).I recently came back to CS GO and have found a much deeper appreciation for it. While I did promise myself when I first got it that I wouldn't go crazy with buying skins, I recently did binge on getting a skin for every weapon. Most skins however were very cheap and I didn't dare attempt to go after a knife since I suck with sneaking up on people anyway.Now unto the actual review. Through practicing in Team Death Match, I've been learning how to use the weapons a lot more efficiently. I'm still nowhere near good but I do actually understand that tapping rather than spraying tends to result in a lot more people dying. When I'm more advanced at the game I'll begin to study how the spray patterns work in more detail so I'm not only tapping left click for all my shots but utilizing the spray more effectively as well.If you're playing the Casual game modes, I'd say it's fine to solo queue because it's quite laid back.For Competitive I tend to like to queue up with full lobby or with at least 1 other person. It makes it feel more fulfilling to either share in the victory or the defeat together.For anyone on the fence about this game or gave it up after not understanding why none of their bullets ever landed on their targets: This game might go on sale for $7.50 around Christmas time. For this price or even a price near that, it's a must have in my opinion. Don't spray at your targets when you're starting off. If you don't know spray patterns you'll just get destroyed and will barely be able to kill anyone. Always try to tap in an almost even rhythm if possible so your shots will be more accurate. Don't worry about winning or losing in the casual gamemodes(non-competitive). As far as I've realized so far, people may say things such as ""rekt"" or ""get owned"" but in the end your calibrated rank isn't being affected by these types of matches. Use new player friendly weapons when you're beginning such as the P90 when you're playing with friends that are more seasoned when they want to play actual games. When you are on your own or are doing death match rounds, use the trickier weapons such as the AK47 or AWP in situations where ultimately whatever happens people won't care about as much.I hope this was somewhat helpful. I'm still new but I have found a new love for this game. I'm pretty sure that once I start solo queuing in Competitive at some point that it'll be like Dota 2 where none of my team mates will speak English and things will be... interesting. Well with that said, I'm off to play some more CS GO!",Sat Nov 27 07:59:35 EET 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

e64c1045-9859-4b85-a514-f545d7865904,4,"An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.69/420",Thu Dec 30 04:03:58 EET 2021,62a6899b-550d-45d7-b4cd-3329be85e915

1be1cf6e-08d6-408f-873e-4ec3dacb2b0a,10,"""Most. Immersive. Game. EVER.\n\nYou'll see what I'm talking about when you end up in a destroyed bridge, trying to hide from demons and nosalies, while cleaning the blood from your gas mask and counting the seconds to change your air filter, so you don't choke to death. And if you think this is bad, wait untill you reach the catacombs, where you will constantly hear the noises of footsteps near you, and when you think you are reaching the exit, your lantern stops working, so you must use your crappy lighter to illuminate the walls (considering how good the light effects are, this is really tense).\n\nI am a big fan of the first game, Metro 2033. I was excited when 4A announced Metro: Last Light. Now, after beating it, here's what I have to say:\n\nUnlike the first game, M:LL is not that hard, which, in my opinion, is not a good thing. Of course, it's not bad, but the high difficulty was one of the things that made Metro 2033 shine. I've rarely had problems with ammo or filters. You now have 3 universal weapon slots, at first I thought this was a bad idea, but it actually works pretty well.\n\nThere were some things that got better, while other were changed to make the game a little easier. Yes, I'm talking about your watch. It's not as good looking as Metro 2033's watch, but it still act as a real watch, which is nice. The timer showing how much air you still have is WAY simpler, instead of colors and pointers, you now have a simple timer showing the time in minutes and seconds. In my opinion, this change was good, because know you must manually change your air filter, which increases the immersion.\n\nWeapons can now be modded. There are not many different mods to buy, but at least you know have something else to spend your military ammo. Most guns from the first game appear in the sequel, like the Bastard and the Helsing. There are new guns too, like the Sniper Rifle, and the awesome Gatling Gun (it's extremely hard to find one, and you can't reload it, so you can't keep it for too long, but it's fun to use when you want to kill everything in front of you without releasing the trigger)\n\nThe graphics are... I have no words to express how beautiful the game is. My only complain here is regarding the animation, the characters are a little stiff, they don't move too much, but considering that 80% of the time you are alone, and the only humans near you are decomposing and/or being devoured by mutants, that shouldn't be a problem ;)\nThe voice acting in english is okay, but here's my advice: play the game in russian with english subtitles, it sounds way better.\n\nWell, this is it. Some things are better, others are worse, but it feels like a true Metro game (an easier game, I must add).\n""",Fri Jan 24 16:10:16 EET 2020,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced.

Keep playing and the awesome CSGO community will be right there to rip it all to shreds and shove it back in your face. Cheers!That's all.. You may catch a few laughs outta the sh*** I wrote in the past down below, but with this summary my review is now complete. Peace out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)-----Update 1------Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :DGood luck and (try to) have fun!----Update 2-----Thanks for all the responses everyone!The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :DI actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!",Mon Jun 21 01:24:42 EEST 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

dce8f3ef-28ee-4ec8-bc51-c680ebd198d6,8,"UPDATE 18/02/2017: New insight on the game. You can read my old review below.Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once.",Sat Aug 07 04:08:40 EEST 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

The immersion and atmosphere in this game is breath taking. I felt like I participated in a lot of ways in the world of metro, a living and breathing world. This is easily one of the prettiest games of 2013 on PC (I played it on Ultra High settings).

f09b6335-46a1-4b41-b0d9-a1258fdff73d,6,"So long, my good friend, so long... I will miss you terribly.Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game.After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did, while not recommending it to anyone at the same time.Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate.Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites.And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered.Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing: Either play always with others, or lose everything you worked for.Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive.It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement.To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories:Casuals: your usual, run-of-the-mill players that team up with a friend or two, or they even may go alone.Premades: Most CSGO players are going in as teams. But, if you are unlucky and bump to a 4 man premade team, you are screwed in most times. Your every mistake will be exploited and become a reason for your team to flame you hard, or even kick you. Very rarely premades will make you feel like an actual part of the team (and these players are worth adding to your friend list).Smurfs: I like to call them the best players the Bane of Global Offensive. Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost.Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost.Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right, smurf accountsIn other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period.Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible.SPOILER ALERT: never open cases, sell them insteadRATING:Gameplay: 8/10 (non-competitive) 3/10 (competitive)Presentation: 8/10Enjoyment (replacing story): 7/10 (non-competitive) 2/10(competitive)Unique Factor: Community: 3.5/10OVERALL: 6.6/10 (non-competitive) 4.1/10 (competitive)Someone get me a match and some alcohol.

It captures the landscape of post nuclear \""reality\"" unlike any other game I've ever encountered. This game started to really get under my skin with some of the visual touches that are constantly scattered around the world (one small example was seeing a skeleton on a bus line holding the body of a childs skeleton). It's not a happy place to be. Survival in the cramped confines of the Metro is all anyone has to look forward to. \n\nWhile there is very much some of the standard fair of a first person shooter there is a story that drives the game forward and has had me playing one more level for several hours past the time I normally like to be asleep. I really enjoyed Metro 2033 and I feel that Last Light has surpassed it in almost every way while continuing the story of Artyom who is the main protagonist from the first game.\n\nOne thing that I am still struggling with is whether the shooting is an improvement or a downgrade. They \""fixed\"" the shooting meaning that bullets that were made after the bomb has fallen will do less damage than pre-war bullets but wont be less accurate (at least that is how it feels). I actually felt that the somewhat unpredictable nature of the bullets in the 2033 added some authenticity to the feeling of that world. On a normal difficutly the shooting feels considerably more traditional shooter. It made the shooting part of the game more fun, but took away a little of the sense of dread with encounters. \n\nI don't think you need to play the first game to get pleasure out of this one but I would certainly recommend it as it still looks darn good. I would easily recommend Last Light as well. \n\nIt is unfortunate (for me) that my favorite games tend to be THQ properties. I don't know how much work Deep Silver had to do on this game before they released it but I am hopeful that they can continue to do this property justice.""",Wed Mar 31 06:34:06 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Thu Aug 19 11:16:27 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

9f831821-cdf7-4104-b055-56fe4a7106f8,5,I play CS:GO since Januar 2014 and it's one of the best Counter Strike's made. I played nearly 5 years CS:S and it was hard to get into the new CS but its worth. Pretty good game :),Wed Jun 30 07:53:47 EEST 2021,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d
9f831821-cdf7-4104-b055-56fe4a7106f8,9,"I am one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'veterans', who started playing with counter strike 1.6 (didn't have my own account by those time, though) and I have long story of 'relationship' with counter strike universe and csgo universe especially. Telling in advance - I made long way from hating csgo up to loving it. But anyway, to the point:For people, who don't know what counter strike is, and who never heard about this game before:Counter strike is unique semi-reallistic game, which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups (somali pirates, phoenix connection, etc) and different law enforcement groups (SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, SWAT, FBI etc). Game features several rounds (from 16 up to 32, depends on a gamemode and server rules), where every player have only one life per round. As soon as round time ends, or one of the teams eliminated, round is finished. After every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets (armor, flash and smoke grenades, etc). Game features several game modes:(classic) hostage rescue (maps with ct_prefix):Counter Terrorists must steal hostage (or any of the several hostages) from a place, secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone. As soon as hostage is brought, or whole terrorist team eliminated, counter terrorists win. If time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area, terrorists win. As soon as counter terrorist carries hostage, whone CT team gets extra 1:30 minute time to reach safe place.(classic) bomb defuse (maps with de_prefix):Terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants. Problem is, there's only one bomb per whole team. As soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead, another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point. Counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place, if it's fallen. As soon as bomb is planted, round time stops and to win, counter terrorists must defuse bomb. If bomb is blown, even though all terrorists are dead, terrorist team wins the round.gungame (Honestly, forgive me if I make mistake here, but it's one of the gametypes I barely played): The least teamplay addicted game type. You start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone, you get new weapon. As soon as you come through all the weapons (including knife), you win the map. You instantly respawn after death. I remember there was also gungame gametype, where you had only one life, but gungame is not my cup of tea, so let's finish on this.deathmatch:Also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death. But, unlike gungame, you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life. You should kill as many enemies, as you can. Thanks to respawn in random places of the map, fight itself reminds a messy war, where enemy can shoot you in the back (just because he respawned there) and so on. I don't normally play this gametype aswell, but if I remember right, this gametype was brought by community.Also, community made more gametypes, like zombiemod, bunnyhop (or whatever is it called) and deathrun, where you need to reach some point.Now, for people who played cs for a while. Main differences from cs 1.6 and css here are: partially new weapons, updated radio commands, updated hostage rescue mode, where you need to actually PICK UP only ONE hostage and bring him to the safe place. Weapons have changed physics, so you'll need to learn everything again. And, an old problem, which became more important duo to competative gamemode: CHEATERS! Can't say there are many cheaters, but when you meet them, whole fun is ruined. Same when you meet stupid people.As we reviewed the game (I tried to be as short as possible), I'll express my mind on it:Firstly, I hated this game. It seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy. It had (and it still has) changed radio commands (yes, I was one of those few people, who used radio commands), you couldn't (and still can't) choose your player model (only team, like in css beta), you had and (still have) some grenades, which, probably don't even exist (decoy and incendinary, the molotov analogue, btw molotov here bounces from the wall, wtf?), or at least I was unable to find any info about them. In hostage rescue mode, why would you need to save only ONE hostage? Why would cops leave another one behind? You couldn't place silencer on M4 and 'base ct pistol', or use flashlight and many more things which I couldn't remeber right now. With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation:First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal...And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games.",Sat Sep 19 02:11:31 EEST 2020,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

e6556e61-8f04-44a8-9ff7-f2ae3033f726,2,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games i just wanna play all the time. This game is really good. The graphics are good, the gameplay are fun and the game modes are fantastic. I have been spending so much time on this wonderful game mode Competitive. Competitive is a mode where two teams are fighting against each other and the first team that wins 16 rounds win the match. You can play this game with your friends, you can play this game with yourself and you can play this game with strangers. I really don't get tired of this game, it keeps my mood up and if i don't know what to play i start CS:GO. If you don't already own this game you should be a shame because this is a MUST own. All in all you won't regret that you bought this game if you like FPS games, the CS series and games made by Valve. And here comes the best thing - Skins. You can buy several skins for your favorite guns. There is alot of skins + You get drops every week. These skins can be bought from the Community Market!Another review by Niko Bellic!

Continuous and spontaneous crashes and other issues (including your aim being locked and you are dropped to 20fps) ruin the competitive experience. The random crashes don't seem to be as common for PC users for whatever reason. Recent updates to the Matchmaking system have now caused lower-ranked players (Silver and Gold Nova) to be continually matched with players with considerably more skill and experience, known as ""Smurfs"" to the community. While these ranking tweaks had good intentions, especially for highly-ranked players (Global Elite, SMFC etc.), they just seemed to amplify the smurfing problem to  a much greater extent. Smurfing ruins the competitive scene, especially for beginners and lower ranked players who have not yet been able to grow and learn to the extent of the experienced 'Smurfs'. While some may acclaim that Smurfing allows players to improve, by playing against players of greater skill, when you lose a gun battle to a smurf, round after round, you're forced to sit and spectate while you wait for the next round to begin. If you are most interested in watching the game instead of being able to play it, watching Professional CSGO tournaments might be your speed. It makes it hard to improve at the game when you are pummeled by a Smurf game after game, day after day.Besides this all, the millions of daily players cannot be wrong. Gameplay is fluent and heavily based on cooperation with teammates. CSGO gives a motivation to improve, to climb the Matchmaking ranks and become the best player you can be. Even the weapon skins add  a huge element to the game that is purely about a virtual economy for aesthetic customisations in-game.CSGO is an immersive experience, and is a great game to play with friends - a game to learn together and grow together to top the ranks of Competitive Matchmaking. However, every game has its flaws. Crashes, gameplay issues and smurfing are amongst the most heinous (and I haven't even touched on the cheaters). Overall, 400 hours of regular playtime speaks for itself, but major issues need to be addressed so that the game becomes more enjoyable for everyone, becomes a more competitive experience and the community can grow together in appreciation of the game.",Mon Jan 03 08:04:24 EET 2022,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

This game's monetization is out of hand.\n-the game's monetization is very bad, with the dlcs it will cost about 200$ to keep up with the current grind, not to mention the season passes you have to buy to gain certain activities, not to mention the other deluxe editions and silver. and also the game is free-to-play so it can put up microtransactions to buy with destiny 2 silver that can't be received without buying it.\n2. The lack of long-term content.\n-the long-term content (which is what i call it) is boring/enraging/repetitive, any order and combination counts. the PVP is made to attract players to play the game more, but its currently the biggest cancer since its a bit of a no-brain fuck fest. with the amount of broken weapons being abused and amount of sweatlords that ruin your chances of getting loot in trials and ruining your enjoyment and you have a very cancerous tumor in the game, gambit is fine with teammates you can coordinate in, but that is irregular and not worth a lot for playing full time. and alot of good content to play, is behind a pay wall.\n3. The game's lack of story\nthis one is not as big of a problem than the others, but the lack of a story for new-comers (or a pile of confused mess) is a bit off-putting hence not giving them interest in the game in the immediate moment.\n\nwith the game's glaring flaws it does have good things.\none is that this game is a gold mine for people who are really interested in special, unique weapons and lore-hunting, to worlds-first raids and community events, this game is made for people heavily interested in this game (myself included), the game has certain fun missions for the people who grind hard or play \""for fun\"", and even a volley of new things on the way for dedicated players to enjoy, like witch queen and its new crafting system. overall this game is a mixed back, because its target audience is very specific, thus not having a lot of people interested in it, but those who are, are awesome and one of the most dedicated and most fun people I could ever find ever (ex. CBGray, Sweatcicle and some other lfg raiders) and it's  a very fun community to join (except those apes in crucible) but the flaws are still there and should be noticed and fixed or changed in some form. \n\ni give it a 7/10\nits great but some things need to be fixed, and they need to give us more than just a few updates to beyond light and a giant pay-wall\n\ntl;dr\nthis game is too expensive, but its fun and addictive""",Sat Oct 09 11:13:13 EEST 2021,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

(Seriously, 60$ is a bit too much for a game that is this old) Also, Activision and Treyarch has refused to acknowledge that there is a security vulnerability (Remote Code Execution) exploits thus has done nothing about it, yet sells it on Steam or other stores for that price. \n\nAbout the RCE, multiple people have reported the security problems (one person even reporting it to Steam about Activision/Treyarch leaving a game with a security vulnerability), but has been ignored by both Activision/Treyarch and Valve. If you buy this game, only buy it for single player, unless you want to get your system hacked and have a online hacker damage your system or cause problems. This is a known problem that has been plaguing the game for years, and has been discussed in online communities.\n\nIf you definitely intend to buy this game for online play, be aware that the only way to play online without security problems is to install something like Plutonium for multiplayer, to avoid being attacked by hackers online.\n\nAnother thing, the game heavily blocks modding for single player, unlike Black Ops 1 (which has modding capabilities using fan modding tools, and CoD4 or World at War, which has native modding support for both single player and multiplayer modding). This also applies to games like Modern Warfare 3, and newer Call of Duty games. The last game to support native modding is Black Ops 3. To mod Black Ops 2 for everything other than multiplayer, mod tools would be required, at least one that has not been released yet to the public.\n\nIf you are looking for adding mods like skin and player character 3d model replacement for both single player (campaign mode) and multiplayer, only older games are supported, with Modern Warfare 2 receiving limited support due to some community members. Well, I'm hoping that Treyarch/Activision will release official mod support/tools for these games, but that's unlikely).\n\nFor reference, search CVE-2018-20817 online (search this up for the article about the security vulnerability exploit), and if you don't know what it is, search \""Black Ops 2 Remote Code Execution\"" on Google. There are many people covering this problem. Another interesting thing, CVE Details also has an entire list of vulnerabilities that games published by Activision has, but has done nothing about.

But it would all be a contradiction in that case. Long story short, game developers no longer know what they're doing. First a battle royale mode, and now this...?What actually costs money is thePrime Edition, which pretty much gives you preference in terms of matchmaking. Which means you'll most likely face other players who bought the game more often.The main problem being that, as it is now a F2P game, hackers won't need to pay up to cheat. If they're banned, they can just make another account. Now, to the actual review.The game is good overall. Mostly based on you using your sight and your hearing to locate enemies. And also controlling your weapon's recoil.Although your weapon may seem normal in your screen, the bullet pattern will certainly not be normal, especially if you're used to spray and pray.Of course, there will be moments of tension where aiming a centimeter lower may get you a kill, or get you killed.Toxicity levels aren't high, but they're not low either. It's what you can expect from a game with a competitive scene nowadays. As you no longer need to pay to play it, installing it is up to you.One thing I'll mention though: just tap fire with the AK-47. And if you're using the AWP, you may want to save the ''honor of using a Sniper rifle to headshot people, because that's why the rifle has a scope on it''.Oh, yeah, and RIP everyone (me included) who paid for the game.",Thu Aug 27 03:17:30 EEST 2020,86f49d86-074f-4a2f-88f6-2df9bc277837

The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response.It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers.The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves.Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community.As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us.""DISCLAIMER: I made this as a joke review because I thought it be creative as hell. This is also to commemorate for the fallen of the Pearl Harbor attack planned by the Empire of Japan, I give credit to FDR for creating the original and thought provoking speech for Congress and the people of the United States. However, I still give this a negative review because I don't agree with valve's instincts of making a BR gamemode to attract a community of children to play this game and the Free to Play option.

2a4d5ca8-39ee-4c0b-9b94-174eed5530ff,1,"The CS:GO community has grown since it was first released a few years ago, but that doesn't mean it has gotten better. The community has inevitably grown to something much more than it was originally intended to be. What do I mean by this? Well I'll point that out.1. The number of hackers/cheaters has only gotten bigger over the years and Valve isn't doing anything about it, unfortunately. Yes, the VAC system works, but there are some cheats out there that are undetectable, an example such as LMAO Box (which is also heavily in TF2). Valve doesn't care about their own community in terms of cheaters/hackers, but they can fix this, by improving the security of their ""reliable"" anti-cheat system. 2. The community is full of trolls and jerks. There will always be at least one or two trolls within a server trhat you currently play in. There always be someone screaming over the mic, cursing out other people, and overall being more or less of a big annoyance. There's nothing you can do about either, you can't mute the person within the game, you have to deal with it or you have to mute your sound or leave to go to another server, which defeats the whole purpose in getting a higher rank. You can also decide to have a poll to have the user kicked off, but this never works. They will always attempt to vote you off if you are caught voting the targeted user off. It's also really annoying when someone voted to reset the server match over 50 times because they died and everyone votes to reset the match. No one cares for other people's enjoyment, they only care about themselves. 3. The economy in this game is demanding. There will always be people asking for things, such as knives, weapon sking and stickers. The first time I heard trading was introduced in this game, I knew it was going to stir trouble. Like TF2, people trade for greed and wealth, not for playing the game for fun. Speaking of which, your always made fun of if you don't have a skin attached to a weapon, not everyone wants those things you know! CS:GO is turning into TF2, Overwatch and COD all at the same time. The community has only gotten worse over the years and Valve isn't doing anything to improve/fix this. I don't want to think of this as another TF2, but unfortunately, that is what it has become and it will likely always be that from now on, because Valve wants all their games to be similar in terms of their other multiplayer games.",Tue Jan 04 16:39:28 EET 2022,35813a73-6674-4f54-a7ff-3ac4c122d581

It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die.

5287b65d-44a8-4172-a946-424c3635dda8,10,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is such a strange time in a young person's life.Don't ask Counter-Strike: Global Offensive why I'm writing this right now. It's late at night and the events of that day seem like they happened so long ago. Yet, I can't get them out of my head right now. Maybe it's just my nerves. Maybe it's the darkness outside. I don't really care, honestly, but I need to get this off my chest. Otherwise, I might not be able to sleep tonight. Damn these memories, I wish they would just go away.It was about eleven years ago when I was in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I was in the seventh grade and I was that kid who wore all black and listened to heavy metal in the back of the classroom. Yeah, I was a goth kid. It seems silly to think about now, but everyone had their own little click when they were in LAN parties, I suppose. The goth scene really appealed to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a kid. I was bullied a lot, even before I decided to wear all black and listen to heavy metal full blast on my walkman. The '♥♥♥♥ everyone else in the world' mantra really suited Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at the time. And, for three of my 'CSGO Buddies', it suited them as well. I guess that's why we got along so well.My CSGO Buddies, two of which I haven't heard from for several years now, were just like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They were goths too. Everyone back then had a clique, I suppose. They were mine. We would spend every waking moment together, both out and in of LAN parties. They were like my strange, outcast family. Well... at least they were. Times change. I still remember their faces clearly. There was Andy, a very tall, robust kid that was the oldest out of all of us. Kyle, my best CSGO Buddy, who was short and very thin. While his frame may have been small, he got into fights -a lot-. He had a fuse the size of a bacterium, and wasn't afraid to give someone he didn't like a black eye. Then there was Billy. Billy was bullied the hardest out of all of us. Braces, pimples, and thick-framed glasses made him the perfect target for bullying. Yet, we four didn't care about anyone else when we were hanging out together. The rest of the world didn't matter; only the next Slipknot album did.I'm rambling aren't I?Well, perhaps I should get to the meat of things then. Where this horrible memory comes from and why I never see those old CSGO Buddies anymore.My CSGO Buddies and I would always go to a park after LAN parties and on weekends to hangout. This park was massive and held a Counter-Strike diamond, a football field, and a soccer field for all of the little kids and their little league games. However, at the edge of this park, was a large wooded area. It was completely cut off from the rest of the park and community. That was where my CSGO Buddies and I would go to hang out. There, no one would see us or bother us. It was the perfect solitude for a couple of goth kids. The strangest thing about this little wooded area, however, was a large, out of place wall that seemed to edge to park. I found out later that the wall was meant to sepaCounter-Strike: Global Offensivee an old World War II factory from the park so that the kids wouldn't have to be reminded of the war, but to a couple of kids growing up in the early 2000's, it was an eerie landmark.The strangest part about the wall... aside from the terrible graffiti, was the seemingly out of place door right in the middle of the wall. The door was completely rusted over and had long lost its handle. The door was more or less part of the stone wall, at this point. I'm not really sure how it was able to stay standing after so many years of disrepair. It was definitely a testament to its forger.Now, I know that this must sound pretty cliché. Yet, I'm sure that whoever is reading this must be pretty curious as to what is behind that door. Well, as fate would have it, it turns out that four goth kids with nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon were also extremely curious as to what was behind that door.That Saturday afternoon, at about four p.m. or so... after the little league Counter-Strike game, I met up with my three bozo CSGO Buddies right by the door, since it was where we usually met. The three had obvious mischievous smiles plastered all over their faces.""Oh, what are you guys planning on doing?"" I asked accusingly, but a smile also stretching over my lips as I looked the three over. Andy grinned devilishly as he picked up a steel Karambit Knife from the tall grass. My eyes widened and my smile widened.""We're opening that door, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I stole this Karambit Knife from my old man's work truck. He's got, like, three of them. He won't even know it's gone."" Andy said laughing a bit. I remember becoming extremely giddy, almost attaining five year old levels of excitement.""Well? What the hell are you waiting for?! Open the door!"" I shouted at him. The other two began encouraging him as well. With a smug look, he placed the Karambit Knife at the frame of the door and began pushing on it. Now, Andy was a big kid and the door was extremely worn down. It didn't take much effort for him to open the door. With a loud crack, the door flung open, and the four of us, dumbstruck, looked into what was behind the door.It was a staircase going down into an incredibly dark basement... or bunker... or something. We couldn't even see the bottom of the stairs because of how dark it was. For about five minutes, we just stared down the concrete stairs in awe. Kyle was the first one to break the silence.""Whoa..."" he spoke, ""It goes down awhile, doesn't it?""""Yeah,"" Billy said, swallowing a bit. ""W-We should go though. Someone must have heard us. We gotta go before they call the cops.""""Oh, don't be such a baby. We've gone this far, we gotta go down the stairs!"" Andy exclaimed. The three of us looked at Andy with worried looks. We may have been goth kids, but we were still kids.""I don't know, Andy. It's pretty dark, and we don't have a flashlight."" Billy said.""Pfft, alright wuss. Go on, Kyle, you go down the stairs.""""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why the ♥♥♥♥ Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? You're the one who opened the door! You go down the stairs!"" He spat angrily. Andy furrowed his brow.""Yeah, and without my Karambit Knife, that door would still be closed, wouldn't it? I already get a free pass on this. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you got here last, you gotta go down the stairs!"" he yelled at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. My eyes widened as my attention turned from the stairs to the three others.""What? Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why? It wasn't even my idea to open the door! I'm not going down there!"" I said, worried.""Come on! Someone's gotta go down. Billy and Kyle are too big of cowards to do it. That leaves you.""""I'm NOT going down there.""""Oh? I can't make you?""""You can't force Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to do it.""""Oh really?""BAM!I felt the large, blunt force of a heavy hand against the back of my head as Andy sucker-punched Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Andy was bigger and, well, let's just say broader than all three of us put together. His punch nearly knocked Counter-Strike: Global Offensive out. In my daze, I remember hearing Kyle shout something as Andy placed his hands on my shoulder and shoved Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I didn't hit the ground like I thought I would. Instead, I just remember falling. Falling down and down into an unfathomable abyss of darkness. He pushed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive down the stairs, but being as light as I was, I never even hit a single concrete step. I just fell, and fell, and fell until I hit the bottom. I hit the concrete floor hard. The impact knocked the wind out of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but, surprisingly, I didn't break any bones or, well, die. The world span and I couldn't even get up, let alone speak.",Thu Jun 17 02:21:56 EEST 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

For this game represents what the media should be like not afraid to show the truth even if it its hard for some to accept due to its content, treating all parties within the content as humans who treat each other as they would treat each other based on their actions and how they would wish to be treated in kind. This game is a rallying cry for all those who wish to through means preferrably passive and only aggrevive if needed to to force the Hereditary Despots and those who would seek to use periods of reform to inflict malice from below or above to steal the capital of the people and seek to prevent the truth of Adam Smiths work for Smith in the Wealth of Nations that Competition and the increase in captial its brings to members of society must be ensured through social practices implemented to moderate, balance, and increase the competition in society through dividing excessively large capital producers into smaller ones to increase competition and to avoid the stagnant malice of command and la seii faire economies who are anathema to progress, meritocratic advancement, and the increases of captial in society. For the political rights of the great hereditary despots who despite being so tiny in overall percentage have 90% of more of the Capital in most societies thus they control the assets and resources that are crucials to the waning and waxing of society thus they not any scapegoats who are almost always created by them in acts of malicus injustice to avoid just punishment for only they are to blame for disasters that take placein society for if they hold most assets they are should put on the figerative and if necessary or just the literal pike of the wealths righteous anger at their suffering at the misuse of the wealth of society. Only those whose wealth has been earned not inherited are to be given political rights in society for they have suffered the peoples woes. Only if they have chosen the same hereditary malice will their rights be stripped and they would be left justly bare to the peoples rage for their suffering. This game is without a representation of what games should be when they feature potentially controversial or \""Offensive\"" content as they approach the matter with courage. honesty, nuance, understanding, and without shame nor guilt for they done no evil but have the necessary balance of bluntness and subtlety needed for such matters. To this day not game has taken the important step in demonstrating the great evil of Japan and why the nukes were not even close to enough for Japan was the greatest evil in World War II, they birthed right wing extremism after the Russo Japanese War Ended, They strated WWII when they Invaded the ROC united under the Pragmatic Chiang Kai Shek who had recently united most of China and led it into a brief period of economic growth during the world wide depression that was ended by the great evil the Figerative Anti Christ of Emperor Showa \""Hirohito\"" and his CCP puppets who lied to the ROC to be allies but betrayed all that is good by killing their country and its culture like the rats they are. For Japan commited the greatest Genocide and Religious War in Human History in the second world war for its people belived Hirohito was a divine descendant of Amaterasu. Japans Genocide killed more than the Nazi Holocausts that butchered most maliciously the Jews, Slavs, Roma, My People the Autistics and ASPs, and the disabled. The Great Japanese Genocide killed more than the Bengal Famine that the British Perpetrated at the same time. It killed more than the Horrific Purges and Holodomor of Ivan The Terribles more callous, paranoid, and malicious reincarnation that was the Devil that wore a Georgians skin that was the Great Evil birthed under a star corrupted by bloody crimson that was Joesph Stalin \""Joe Steel\"", For the Great Japanese War Against Humanity was commited against all it encounter it butchered and defiled the Korean peoples and saught to annilate their culture. It commited acts of the greats evil that no one else in history of the time commited in the guise of sanitation, disease control, science and patriotism. It painted entire cities the blood and tears of the innocent. It inflicted the greatest evils humanity has yet encountered in our history. But hope was given in science and the perserverance of the oppresed as birthed the great cleanser that was instrument of Atomic Fire that could have justly freed the world of the Amatersan Evil and the CCP that was its puppet that it corrupted, twistedm and enthralled to butcher Humanity. Yet we were betrayed by the Judas Macarthur who succomed to the Evil of Amaterasu and her CCP rats. For instead of using the Lance birthed in the Atomic Fires of Creation to slay the CCP and the great bastions of Evil that were Tokyo and Kyoto and all shrines and bastions of the Amaterasan evil we only destroyed two cities were Justice and Good Will demanded that we protect Humanitys future by eradicating all remnants of the Amaterasu line and all that held it close for now by sparring the Evils of Amaterasu, The CCP, and The most evil Psychopath who corrupted all he touched in its dark fortress within the Manchulund and the monsters that was his servant who worked under the guise of sanitation to inflict corruption, suffering, hell, and malice that is without a peer so far in Human History. For MacArthur betrayed humanity by sparring them all and now we are left the fear of what how these evils will affect the present and future. For this game is a testament to that as its the only media of its kind to dare to even shed light on the truth and that is more than enough to have earned my undying love and respect.""",Mon Dec 06 23:10:44 EET 2021,3b23e390-13c7-4ad8-a095-0c844959f8c2

7739e700-980d-4b98-a902-0e4588e8db6b,4," I don't speak English really well, so try to understand what is implied.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer FPS games, where two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, battle for a specific mission. The game was initially a mod for Half-Life, Valve's first game, until the sequels of the game were created some time later.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest game of the series, and today it is the most-popular competitive FPS game ever played. The game is just basically the same as the first Counter-Strike games, but a ton of additions and improvements were done.  Graphics First, the graphics. This is probably the biggest improvement in the series, as the game now looks more pleasing to the eyes, it has smooth movements throughout the game, and there has been a lot of decal improvements. Compared to the earlier games, Global Offensive provides a better and player-friendly nature thanks of today's modern graphics.Of course all of these cannot be achieved if you don't have the requirements to play on a flawless gameplay, but it is believed that it can run even on entry-level PC's.  Gameplay Gameplay. As I have said before, Global Offensive is mostly the same as the earlier games, consisting of the two game modes Bomb Scenario, wherein Terrorists must plant a bomb to a bomb site in a map and the Counter-Terrorists must defend or defuse the bomb if planted, and Hostage Scenario, wherein Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages held by Terrorists.Though there are additionals game modes that can be played. These modes are the Arms Race, Demolition, and Deathmatch. (although I believe these modes can be played on the previous games through a mod)Global Offensive also made changes to the gun system, they have added more guns to the shop and made improvements to them.The sound is still the same as the previous ones, however, around this year they have made changes to the guns' sounds, But the sound from Global Offensive is a lot better and clear than the others. Community The community is what most Valve games' community have. There isn't really much to say here, although it's worth mentioning that the community on this game series is actually more friendly and cooperative than other Valve's games. And since this a competitive game, (I'd say highly competitive), a lot of players are pretty serious on playing since this involves a huge amount of cooperation with the team.Toxicity is somewhat not that visible to the game, so players who are really serious about competitive games are present. Miscellaneous Like DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2, Valve's other popular games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has also what they call the inventory system. Here you can get item drops such as gun skins, gun stickers, and cases where you can get the gun skins and stickers. These items can be used to customize your gun loadout, or sell them to the Steam Market, where you can get money from. (If you are lucky, there are rare items which have high price on the market listings where you can sell those rare items for $$$.) Final Notes Overall, this game is one of the best games out there, for a cheap price, and offers a lot of opportunities to choose how you want to play the game. You could try making yourself into the game and go for the rankings, play casually to pass time, or probably to troll just to relieve stress and have fun for yourself. There is a lot of space for you to improve in the game, but still, like most multiplayer game does, playing this game with friends give the best possible experience and gameplay for the game.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not a pay-to-win game, and if you wanted to spend money on this game, make sure you just make it worth the money you spend on the game.-----------Definitely get this game if you want to get started on competitive gaming, or if you're just looking for a game that is worth the time and money spending. In fact, the most annoying and irritating things that could occur in the game is actually the most hilarious and most fun to deal with.Counter-Strike is a really popular game, so why not just get the game, and shoot down other players and join the fun?",Sun Dec 05 22:56:48 EET 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613
c6a0cc0a-0f42-4acd-a7cc-6daa447e5b47,5,"""When friendship is built on sincerity and honour, the endings are epic\nThis is simply the story of red  dead redemption. The hero of the story, Arthur, meets his mate John in the midst of a crashing world rife with decadence. The two friends get along with each other like two brothers. With the rest of the gang, they must escape from pursuit. Here the story begins and events accelerate rapidly.\nCan Arthur keep pace with the pace of events amid storms of adversity? This is what you see in the story.The story begins in 1889 and ends in 1908, and during these years you see many changes in the world around you.\nFate decided to make the gang members meet with individuals who join them while they are being chased by the authorities. Each member of the gang has a special skill and each individual has a story that has both positive and negative sides. The story gives you a lesson on how to deal with those around you and not to be naive by being a fast judging on people around you. Appearances can be deceptive\nArthur is an example of a hero who is loyal to his friends with all what he has.  John is an example of a loyal person who keeps his promises. The world of red dead redemption is a diverse world based on a fictional simulation of the United States during the decline of the Wild West era. You have 5 fictional states based on real life states of the Midwest   southern and west coast parts of the United States. \nIn harmony with this diversity of landscapes, the fauna and the ecological life of the world around you varies from one state to another. As well as the customs and habits of people vary in each state. Simply the game gives you the impression that you are living in that period. When you travel north, you need heavy clothes while in the south you need light clothes and so on. In summary It's a game that leaves its mark on your life. For this game and witcher 3 are the best games I ever played. It should be nominated as  The game of the Decade.\n--{ Graphics }---\n☑ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Average\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ Meh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ soundtrack}---\n☑ Make your eyes water \n☐ Masterpiece\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☑ High End\n☑ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n\n---{ Story }---\n☐ is there a story?\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☑ It'll replace your life\n\n\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☑ what are you waiting for ?\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☑ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved""",Thu May 20 22:16:21 EEST 2021,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Thu Dec 09 22:42:47 EET 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

cafc992c-cbd8-445e-852f-b0a2aca165e5,6,"""Metro Last Light is often overlooked but it’s definitely one of the best games of the year.\n \nSet in a post-apocalyptic Moscow which was destroyed by nuclear war. A small handful of the population managed to seek shelter in the subway tunnels beneath the city. Twenty years have passed, the world has become inhabited with mutants and the surviving population has broken up into various factions.\n \nFeaturing a strong narrative and great pacing, Metro will keep you immersed the entire time. The story is told through eyes of a ranger named Artyom and not through irritating and pacing-breaking cutscenes like a lot of other games. Journal entries can also be found and Artyom serves as a narrator who often talks about the events unfolding around him.\n \nIt’s the direct sequel to Metro 2033 but playing the first title isn’t required to enjoying the game.\n \nMetro Last Light tries to do a bit of everything, it’s primarily a first person shooter but it incorporates stealth elements very well. It also feels like a survival horror at points and can be quite tense when you venture out onto the irradiated surface with a gas mask. The audio is great and the screams of mutants in the distance will always keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a fairly large variety of enemies which are all hideous, unique and well done.\n \nThe atmosphere is amazing, same with the graphics. It’s worth noting that a somewhat powerful computer is required to running Metro Last Light. I was able to run the game at 1920 x 1080 on Very High at around 70FPS average with an Intel i5 3470K Processor, 16gbs of RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 560TI. I have heard that the game does have some issues with certain ATI cards though which can be fixed by turning off Physx in the settings.\n \nMetro Last Light also has multiple endings and plenty of re-playability. It may appear linear early on but it quickly branches out later allowing plenty of room for exploration.\n \nFor a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsPrciV5i2U\n \nMetro Last Light also managed to make our Top 35 List for the best games of the generation.

My opinion, however, is that this game's competitive ranking system is total garbage. Now before you go on raging in the replies saying ""ERMAGURD GO BACK TO COD MAD CUZ BAD GET GUD LUL"" please read the following.This system is poorly designed because you constantly have to be paired with good teams in order to win games and thus rank up in your competitive rank. For the uneducated, the more games you win, the more likeley you are to rank up, but if you lose games, you lose your rank. When you are constantly being paired with people who don't have microphones or toxic squeakers who don't know what they're doing, you derank all the way to silver one. The non comeptitive rank literally means nothing and is just there to look nice, which in my opinion should determine which skill group you're in for competitve, but nope. The system Valve built requires you to get lucky and be paired with a decent team that can communicate easily and knows what they're doing, which won't happen unless the planets align during a full moon.So if you don't want to constantly grind competitive matches and face a toxic community filled with tryhards and squeakers, don't download this game.",Thu Dec 02 20:34:35 EET 2021,86f49d86-074f-4a2f-88f6-2df9bc277837

CS:GO as any of the CS games has, one of the most addictive and challenging gameplay ever. Technically the game is perfect: good graphics, fast respond updates to bugs and problems. One of the best anti-cheat systems in the world. Yep, better than Blizzard's. (You may not agree with the sentence about the anti-cheats, but I will explain this down.) And, even the market for ""goods"" and DLCs is perfect. It's focused on the older and more experienced players. Lots of ""skins"" for the new players and new ""operations""(maps) for the older players. The more you play, the better this game becomes. Like I said, technically perfect on any aspect. The problem comes form the game community. You may agree with, that the most of the players in this game are 12 years old kids with urgent desire to sleep with your mother. And, after few hours with the game you will become a polyglot linguist, mostly in slavic phiology (Polish, Russian). But this aren't the main problem. The problem is in the COMPLETE tolerance, the COMPLETE ignorance and the COMPLETE lack of knowledge from the community, about the CHEATERS. This game possess one of the most complete anti-cheat systems. It covers every aspect of the game: VAC- automatic anti-cheat program, Overwatch system for precise observation. This two programs are in constant communication with the main game and the ""Matchmaking system""- so, all of the cheaters to end playing against each other and to get banned. But, ...BUT... This system relys on, the ""willingness"" of this community to use this system, to deal with the cheaters. Unfortunately, by this complete negligence the system is doing more damage to the people who are willing to help by using it. Rather than to the cheaters.If you are ""new"" to the game. My advice is to skip this game and don't start it.",Thu Dec 12 00:03:31 EET 2019,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

Within 4 hours i reached Rank 3 Battleships, and level 7.I downloaded the game expecting it to be like most other Vehicle Combat games on the market right now, with health bars and just shoot where ur cursor is, and to an extent that's the case here. Now you could say War Thunder has spoiled me with it's Interiors and modular system, but to an tiny degree WoWs has it too with guns being knocked out and fires spreading. But it's not quite up to WT standerds of having each crew being able to be knocked out and shooting at direct points of armour to hit a small ammo rack or feul tank. Now it does Have Armour but not X-ray. Well It keeps me happy that the HP bars aren't too overused.But let's get real here, nowadays EVERYONE talks about Graphics or FPS. For me, BOTH were above average. I got arround 30-40 fps on the highest settings and it looked great ! But still not a solid 60 or 200 ... War Thunder has this issue too, so i will let this one slide.Although the game does hold your hand annoyingly in the first levels. When i started the game, i was fustrated because i couldn't even access the Tech Tree until i was level 2. I spent atleast 20 minutes looking in the game settings and their video tutorials for where the button to it might be hidden. And when i DID get the tech tree open, it's shallow AS ♥♥♥♥. There is like only 10 ships of 1 type per type FOR 3 TYPES or if your lucky and picked America or Japan you get Aircraft carries ......... Even though britain ruled the waves, they still don't have a flushed out tech tree.Now even though the i am from England, and the British Empire did have the largest navy in the tree i could atleast get the famout Hood right ? The biggest ship in the Navy ? Well the Japanese get the Yamato and the Yanks get the Iowa, BUT NO the Hood was made a premium ...

1e10d15c-b186-4f38-9c5c-1447c7a248bb,3,"""Now yes i know no one is gonna read this book im about to make but may as well throw it here because it deserves it. I saw this game come out and i didnt get the chance to play it, and in doing so i lost interest in it very quickly. Never watched a single video on it and really didnt seem like a game i would play anyway so i thought \""oh well doesnt matter anymore\"". 2 years later and here i am. I was recommended the game by a friend and it was on sale at the time and decided to buy it and give it a try. I was greeted by some very amazing graphics i havent seen in a game before. It was so realistic that i got so immersed and when i woke up a day after playing i expected to wake up at a camp (not joking). I even took a small break and went for my daily jog and thought a horse was following behind me. So if you're wondering about the graphics, yes, they're very great. As for the gameplay? It was some of the best i ever played in my life. The dead eye mechanic was a great thing to use if you ever got cornered by a bunch of enemies, which happened to me a lot. The horse mechanics are some of the best ones i've ever seen and used in a video game. Its like riding an actual horse. The calm mechanic and caring for the horse is very accurate. The NPC's will even comment on your horses care and if its a good horse or a terrible one based on the stats. Truly an amazing way to implement horses into a game. The gameplay is just so damn good i cant get over it. I absolutely love it. This game made me addicted to it in the most amazing way possible, and i love it. Its also for the very first time since skyrim, destroyed my sleep schedule. I am now going to talk about the story of the game, so if you dont want to be spoiled and you yourself are a new buyer then i recommend not reading further, so i will say here that the game is a 100000000000/10. go play it. Now without further a due... The Story. The story of the game was really, really beautiful. I didnt play red dead 1 so i dont know how the gang met up or their backstory. But when getting faced with such an amazing story like this? i honestly didnt care. It was just so fluent and clear to me. as if i already knew the characters backstories. I didnt know at the time but the ending depends on your honor meter being low or high. And i of course, had my honor meter low because almost every person i ran into i tried robbing. I even found some old crazy guy and put him out of his misery thinking it was the ok thing to do. But anyways onto the major parts of the main story. Over all the story was very amazing and some parts were pretty sad. The death of Sean really hit home for me because i loved his character. He seemed like an annoying little brother that everyone acts like they hate but actually loves. His death really hit home for me. I felt like an actual person had died right in front of me. I didnt get the high honor arthur scene for him. I dont know it and wont search it because im gonna play through the game again and do everything right. As for Keirans death? It honestly didnt effect me that much. He really wasnt in the story that much and i never really saw him aside from bill wanting to cut his balls off. Hosea and Lenny's death on the other hand hit like a locomotive. After hunting with Hosea, and getting drunk with lenny, they felt like actual friends to arthur and i couldnt believe it when they died. It was truly something to behold. Mid way through the story i found a white arabian horse in the mountains. I decided to break it and ride with it a bit. After finally studying it i found out that its stats were just the same as the black arabian that i had been using. And since i had bonded with the black one more i decided to sell it. I then later looked at a horse guide and apparently that was one of the best horses in the game. I laughed my ass off for a good 5 minutes. But now back to the story. When i ended up on Guarmara I thought \""my fucking horse is gone\"" and i wouldnt see it ever again. But Guarmara was amazing. i actually had fun on that island. Manning the cannon was very cool and taking down that ship was really awesome. I remember when that one shit stain who enslaved the people of the island tried to bomb the escape ship and i immediately shot him in the head on sight. gg, ez, no re, cope, seethe, mald. But seeing Dutch go into this pit of madness was really an amazing development of his character. Slowly drifting away from what the character taught others and himself is a personal favorite of mine. But is unfortunate that I never got to see Dutch redeem himself. The ending i got was to say the least, heart breaking... When Arthur gave John his hat and said \""I dont have a use for this no more\"" I immediately broke into tears. I couldnt stop crying even while fighting that damn rat micah. I was then playing as John. So if anything i must say that this game is an absolute masterpiece to me. I havent played a game this good in 5 years. And so after all of that. And after 38 hours of gameplay within the span of a week of playing, i give this game a ∞/10. I truly love this game and that Rockstar games put everything they had into this game. Thank you, Arthur, for the amazing trip.""",Fri Mar 12 19:21:17 EET 2021,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

[i]We'll note that soon (in witch queen) there will be a crafting system for our weapons. Can't wait to see what it will be like![/i]\n\nPVE as PVP there are several levels of difficulty and you can feel a real progression when you are well surrounded you start to make a good stuff, to get good weapons, look at every little detail to min max your build, develop your game sense. If you are motivated and invested you can only progress and DAMN it's satisfying to see yourself progress and be able to do more and more complicated things!\nFor the PVP don't expect quality, the servers are still in the Middle Ages in peer to peer, the matchmaking is often not fair. But if you are patient and persistent the gameplay Destiny 2 offers is very satisfying, for example by landing multiple headshots with a sniper or winning a duel by baiting the enemy's senses, bouncing a grenade off a wall to hit an opponent behind the cover and a lot of other cool stuff. \n\nFor the lore enjoyer: the story of this game is deep, meticulous, every little detail, every little enigma, nothing is left to chance.\nHowever, reading and following the story can be complicated as you have to collect and search for every little detail in the game. Hopefully there are databases on the web and youtubers such as: [u]My name is Byf[/u]\n\n\n\nMisc: third party websites make your experience on the game more fun, smooth and can give other objectives as well, here are some of them: [url=https://destinyitemmanager.com] DIM [/url], [url=https://bray.tech] bray.tech [/url], [url=https://www.light.gg] light.gg [/url], [url=https://raid.report] raid.report [/url]\n\nFor example my favourite activity in the game by far, are raids. Here's my [url=https://raid.report/pc/4611686018483009096] raid.report [/url]\nThe website displays your record of all the raids you have done or left, they have a badge system and speedruns, completions ranking, between all players. (Worldwide ranking)\nChallenge seekers will be served: three man, two man or even solo raids that are normally done with 6 players. Finish them without any player dying, etc.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, after more than 5k hours on this game, I haven't managed to collect all triumphs, farm all godrolls of each weapons, main all characters with all subclass because Destiny is constantly evolving and that can be the biggest advantage as well as the biggest disadvantage at the same time.\n[b]5k hours and I still haven't stopped so what are you waiting for?[/b]\n\nI hope this has been helpful, most importantly have fun.""",Wed Dec 22 03:26:32 EET 2021,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

06d02f9f-dad9-4b11-9ad1-20d61a2e6d79,7,"""Metro: Last Light is the sequel to Metro 2033. The game is set at post-apocalyptic Moscow.  What stood out for me in this game first and foremost are the graphics.  This is one of the few titles that rivals the likes of Crysis.  The graphical detail that this game has to offer is just amazing.  Even better if you turn on advanced PhysX!  During both the tunnel and outside missions, I felt like the developers did a great job of creating an immersive environment to play in.  I think that they created a realistic vision of what it would be like to live in a post nuclear-war environment.  The fog, ruins, tunnels, swamps, lighting, underground settlements, creatures and beasts all look spectacular. \n\nThe game is linear and divided into chapters.  Even though it's linear, you can still do some exploration to find weapons, ammo, and collectibles.  The weapons in this game are all fun to use, and can be customized in shops.  The storyline will keep you interested, and there is plenty of lore to be read from diaries.  But what impressed me the most was all the lore you could listen to just by standing next to other people and children and listening to their conversations.  The attention to detail in these interactions was very impressive.  \n\nIn most chapters involving human enemies, you can play stealthily throughout.  There's even an achievement for not killing any humans throughout unless forced to.  I like the fact that you can directly affect the environment by turning light sources on and off.  Going in guns blazing is also a good choice because again, the weapon selection and gunplay is a plus.  My only gripe with Metro: Last Light is the A.I. behavior.  Human opponents sometimes act in stupid ways, can get stuck or go on loops, and some of their actions after they detect you simply don't make sense.  This might ruin immersion for some.  Replayability lies in the form of DLC mission packs.  The game also has 2 endings, so it might warrant a second full playthrough.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game.  Especially if you like good graphics and environment.""",Sun Jun 06 06:18:54 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e
06d02f9f-dad9-4b11-9ad1-20d61a2e6d79,5,"It's a great game. Definitely one of my favorites. Unfortunately all things have good and bad sides:Pros:- Amazing graphics for a supposedly ""arcade"" game(Seriously though, they are good even if it was a simulator)- Good audio- Huge playerbase(you usually get into a battle within 1:30 minutes)- Divisions and clans(Good to play with friends)- Huge variety of ships(200+ ships from 8+ nations. Also there are four(4) ship types: Aircraft carrier, Battleship, Cruiser   and Destroyer.)- It has its own fun and adrenalin filled moments.- Lots of third party mods for people who like that kind of stuff.- Very well optimised(It can run quite well on even a old computer)So far so good. But we still have the cons:- LOOOONG grind to tier X(like maybe 3-5 months per LINE of ships)- Matchmaking is a bit of a problem: Sometimes you don't even want to sail in a tier V ship unless you absolutely have to.   Trust me when you're fighting a tier VII ship in a tier V it's hard.- Some people can be salty: Some people might get upset when they get destroyed or if matchmaking does not favour   them. Even i'm salty sometimes when i get one-shotted by someone.- Premium ships: These are ships you have to pay to get. They are usually stronger than the normal mainline variant of the   ship. These are expensive(around 3500 inr for a tier VIII premium battleship).- Premium account: Like premium ships, there is a premium account status that you can pay to get. This gives you   increased credit and XP income. It's a little bit more fairly priced but it's still expensive.Overall, its a great game. Definitely a game i would recommend.

Only “hubs” that can only be reached by underground are dying.\nThere are tons of streets, squares, backyards, shops and apartments as well as sewers to explore. The possibility to get to inaccessible places via balconies or lifting platforms, to sneak past opponents or just to take a shortcut over the roofs is gigantic. The structure reminds me a bit of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/205100/]Dishonored[/url] only much nicer and much better.  Also the interiors are not quite as copy pasta as e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/704270/]Generation Zero[/url] and make the whole thing more believable. Regardless of which building it is, everything is just completely thought out and extreme attention was paid to all details so that you get the feeling that it could actually be a place in the near future. The game offers immense mobility in the sometimes extremely nested levels, but these are never really confusing.\n\nIn terms of play, Mankind Divided is, in my opinion, more aimed at players who do not necessarily want to shoot their way through the game armed to the teeth, but rather at those who want to penetrate a building unnoticed or secretly want to sneak into an enemy camp and get themselves also take the necessary time for the game. Unfortunately, the game has a few weaknesses here so that it happens that you are discovered, for reasons that are not yet apparent to me, or \""civilians\"" panic simply and for no reason and thus trigger an \""alarm\"".\nAt this point I would also like to briefly note that it is advisable to save the game status more often in the game. If you are looking for archivements, it will be much easier for you. A manual saving before you have reached your destination, for example, at which a conversation is triggered, has the advantage that if you screw it up and thus the side mission is not triggered, you can simply do it again.\n\n[b]Before you hack something[/b], you should always make sure that nobody is really around and can disturb you. The ambient noises are almost completely faded out during a hacking process and if you are then attacked by someone, it will be canceled immediately.\n[u]Regardless[/u] of the smaller weaknesses like one or the other logic error and the sometimes unwieldy controls, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is in my opinion an [b]excellent game with numerous (secondary) missions long playing time and a great replay value.[/b]\n\n[b]Jensens Storys:[/b]\nThe digital deluxe version also includes the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/470070/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided_DLC__Season_Pass/]Season-Pass[/url], which in my opinion is completely unnecessary except for the two story DLC's [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413360/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided__System_Rift/]System Rift[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413370/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided_DLC__A_Criminal_Past/]A Criminal Past[/url], which come up with further side missions and achievements\n[b]If you value the story and the \""complete package\"", you should only play the expansions after the main story has been completed.[/b]\n\n[b]Breach:[/b]\nApart from the main story, there is also the breach mode. As far as I know, this is available [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/555450/Deus_Ex_Breach/]separately and free of charge[/url] on Steam and is already integrated in the Digital Deluxe Edition at Mankind Divided.\n[b]But there really isn't a story here.[/b]\nBreach is basically pure gameplay in a virtual environment or in a computer program or, to put it more simply, a pure hacking game in which you have to steal data cores and infiltrate networks.\nCan be fun and is a good change from the main game. \nUnfortunately, Breach has an [u]online compulsion[/u] that you cannot avoid.\nThose who collect achievements can be happy if they have Mankind Divided and Breach in their library.

3a7413f1-f55c-4efb-8306-c282dc9fec51,8,I played this game before it was on steam and when it was first released and I loved even spent probly 50-100 hours on it and spent some money on it. After awhile I stopped playing it for no reason other than I just moved on to something else it but now I saw it was on steam and decided to try it out again. Well lets put it this way its a completely different game than it was before and I feel personally its not better its worse. The UI is competely trash on the main screen. The keybinds are not the same as before and the keybinds are horrible I couldnt play with how they are on default and yes I know you can change them but still the controls are confusing and just plain out bad. The match making isnt great at all as its awsome to get placed with tier 4 ships at tier 1 which is kinda of ruins the whole pvp system. The only thing I liked was the PVE that now if it doesnt fill up with players under 30 seconds it places bots which is nice.This isnt a bad game it was just a better game before they reworked everything and changed things around again my option is some of those changes werent great. Basically if you never played this game before you might like it and you wont notice or care about some of the big issuses I have with it now but to anyone who has played this game when it was in beta might not like the things they did.,Sat Jul 11 14:18:00 EEST 2020,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections.

8001ba97-76f7-4386-a352-3002bcbcfc36,4,"""This is basically my worst nightmare in a game\nLeading on from Metro2033 this game is set in a post-apocalyptic underground railway system in Russia, where the character must struggle against the survivors of a Nuclear war and the creatures that the war bred. The metro is largely abandoned by humans and is instead possessed by the supernatural and mutated forms of animals along with strange and unexplainable entities. The few humans that did survive the Nuclear fallout and have learned to adapt to the metro way of life have done so at the expense of their humanity. The main factions faced are the communist 'Reds' who dominate the metro by killing anyone in their way, and the facist 'Nazis' who worship the nazi doctrine and have thier own concentration camps for those with less than desirable features or beliefs. The men found in and out of these factions are brutal and merciless, rape, murder and torture is largely practised in the game, often in front of you or with your optional participation. I often had to pause the game at regular intervals to close the doors around me and turn on the lights nearby, the horrific storyline combined with the graphics and complexity of the creatures and people faced was too much.  If the remains of life are not enough to scare you the texture and plot will. Superb animation and detail  with a highly immerisve story and character development make this game a pure masterpeice. \nSome points of this game may look like a typical 1st Person shooter but it is most definitely not, this has got to be one of scariest but most interesting games i have ever played. Very little 'spray and pray' combat and a heavy focus on stealth and silent takedowns, although going loud is always an option. Additonally each in each peice of comabt you face a diffrent kind of enemy with diffrent strategies. One minute its human bandits the next its waves of giant scorpion like things. Each confrontation happened for a reason. This element in particular left me impressed as most shooting games get fairly repeditive and boring after a fashion but this most certaintly did not.  Another great feature was also the option to choose your own actions, you can execute or spare people, rob them or donate to them. Alway free will which i love.  \nIn summary BUY BUY BUY BUY if you are into horror, action or just generally have good taste. \n""",Wed Oct 27 16:33:24 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

If like me your an aggressive player, this isnt rewarded on this game as your secondary batteries are rendered completely obsolete by torpedos. A typical game is, Destroyers charge up, then pop smoke and sit in this spamming torps. Once smoke clears, they pull back, recharge then repeat. Battleships sit as far back lobbing shells. Aircraft carriers are near impossible to make money with so hardly encountered.

I played the first iterations of world of warplanes, it was crap and connection to other players was almost nonexistent, but after not playing since it came out, I saw a video and thought id give it another try, it was much better than when it came out, with world of warships I played it and loved it, until my computer killed itself, then after getting a new pc after 2 and a half years I came back to the game and was amazed by how many more ships there were, the game has grown so much from when it came out, and its gotten better as the years have gone on.",Sun May 02 18:48:05 EEST 2021,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

c44b24ff-152b-4fe5-894f-be4c7b248351,6,"Experience epic, free-to-play naval combat when you helm one of over 200 historic vessels in an exciting balance of strategy and real-time combat in World of Warships. Outfit your fleet with flags, camouflage, modifications, talented commanders, and more!World of Warships is one of the World of X titles in Wargaming portfolio, next to World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. It's a clash of 16-24 ships in PvE bot battles, scenario missions or PvP combat. You take control of a ship - quick and agile destroyer, slow and tanky battleship, somewhere-in-between cruiser or a plane carrier - and destroy other ships while trying to control strategic points on the map.WoWs looks very pretty and if you're interested in navy battles just play it. It's free after all. If you don't know if you're interested... It's a rather slow and strategic, mostly PvP, naval fight game. It's extremely fun even if you don't like PvP games and it can really suck you in. It's a squad based game, so your enjoyment greatly depends of the quality of your team. If your team is bad you will lose. Most often than not it's not possible to carry and, as there are no respawns, the margin for error is slim, even if you're amazing but have a bad team you will fail. And failing is not fun. I have to say I have a love hate relationship with this game as I love the idea, looks, music and pretty much everything, but bad teams make me hate it very much. For that hate moments there are bot battles though, these are easier and more fun even if less rewarding.As to the f2p aspect. The game can be enjoyed free for a long time. Having said that mind that in higher tiers - there are 10 - you can lose in-game money, needed for resupply, when playing normally. You can gain money playing lower tiers though, so it's not like you have to pay to play. If you want to pay the game can be extremely expensive with ships costing up to 50 euro per one (that's normal for these kind of games unfortunately, WarThunder is the same). Real world money gives you some more in-game money (needed for resupply and parts), xp (for captain skills) or cosmetics, but doesn't give you any additional power (like special ammo). Also while you can buy premium ships for money without any grinding you will not be proficient enough to succesfully play them. And most of them are great for collectors but so so for competitive play.One more thing, you have to invest time into the game. To not suck much in PvP you'll need ca. (20hrs * tier) of playtime, more or less, so for tier V you'll need about 100hrs of playtime to be proficient enough not to be a burden. Your milegae may vary.I liked:* looks, everything looks sooo pwetty* music* bot matches are fun and relaxing* PvP matches are fun and keep you on edgeI disliked:* it's multiplayer so expect lots of salt* if your team is bad you might not have any fun at all (most teams are bad)Get this if:* you're interested in navy battles and history, lots of classic ships like Perth, Yamato, Bismarck, Warspite, etc.* you like PvP games that don't require twitch reflexes* you like to watch pretty boats in a large pond (if you're less competitive just play low tier bot matches and enjoy)Don't get this if:* you cannot stand the salt in PvP* you cannot stand the grind (~100hrs are needed to get not bad, way more to get good; ~300hrs to get to tier 10 ships without buying premiums)",Mon Jan 11 09:14:00 EET 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

The feeling while playing is awesome, it's so different from all the other games i usually play, the sounds, atmosphere: it's amazing and a whole new world.I believe that it becomes pay2win when playing competitive because of the strong premium ships, but i dont care about that, i'm just a casual tryna have fun, and the game is ideal for that: free2play, fancy graphics, sound and atmosphere, you only get matched with similar (~) tier ships so when ure beginning you wont get stomped, easy to learn (more or less).So give it a try, it'll definetely be worth the time waiting for the download to finish (ye thats much space, but its because awesome games need much space ;D)!",Sun Aug 22 06:07:10 EEST 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

e4f72ede-33a2-46e1-9d85-39de8200c456,4,"""Deus Ex franchise's setting is one of my favorite original video game settings. Considering i don't like dystopian futuristic settings in any medium be it movies, novels or video games, the devs deserve credit for pulling off a big feat here. The world they created is so realistic and so are its problems, you can look at the present world and this fictional future and it looks totally believable and relative to our own problems nowadays.\nWhen it comes to gameplay. Stealth, this is as good as it gets, to put it simply there are so many ways to approach a situation that every one can have their cup of tea.\nThis particular game has pretty short main campaign but the amount of side content makes up for it in my opinion. Which also in my opinion belongs to 'highest quality side content' section of RPG rankings. The side quests perfectly fit in the world and the conflicts that the main campaign is dealing with seamlessly. The characters are so well written and unique, the writing overall is pretty good. If you like stealth games and/or choice based narrative progression, i don't see how you could go wrong with this one.""",Fri May 21 04:24:55 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Wed Oct 20 20:40:03 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

9e371e0b-fe29-4143-b604-7fde922b8a07,9,"Quite a mixed bag, unfortuantely, with little to no mechanism for keeping player's engaged.The first ten-fifteen hours whilst you're learning the mechanics and unlocking the different ship classes are genuinely fun. It's visually engaging, the ships handle well, particularly the fast cruisers they start you off with and timing your shots requires real skill. Finding a game is easy and level up fast and unlock quite a few ship classes rapidly, giving you a firm handle of the mechanics pretty fast: Battleships are slow and heavy hitting, Destroyers are fast and fire torpedoes, Cruisers mix speed with heavy cannons and Carriers play like a simple RTS, with you directing planes to attack enemy ships from the map.However, that's all it ever is. When you get Carriers at around level 4 you have experienced all the gameplay mechanics you ever will, which is unforunately the point at which you are expected to seriously grind to unlock the remaining 6 levels of ships. Each ship class has at most one or two abilities, none of which makes for a really compelling mechanic in themselves, and these don't really change as you level up. There's none of the diverging options you get from a MOBA, nor are the base classes particularly engaging either. Sure, the higher levels become more powerful or handle differently, but every battleship will be slow and hit hard, regardless of level 10 or level 4. There are zero differences in their skills. Unless of course you buy the upgrades or earn them through lootboxes.I honestly don't have a problem with the Pay2Win elements. Do I think the upcoming Stalingrad battleship and its unashamed overpoweredness stinks? Sure. But they aren't egregious at the low levels, and only become a problem at higher levels, which you will need a lot of patience to reach. There are obligatory loot boxes, but the stuff they provide again felt incredibly pointless, particularly when if your ship sinks it loses most of the upgrades on it. Honestly, considering that the flags and camo patterns add colour to an overwhelmingly grey game, it is a bit of shame that they are lost when your ship sinks. It would be much more interesting if they were permenant, purely visual, upgrades. In a game where only a few ships survive most games, it does make these upgrades feel trivial.There are a few remaining gripes I have.  The game REQURIES teamwork to be fun, but the devs have failed to create the tools which would engage the audience sufficiently in this. Being able to see the paths of your allies would be great. Being able to see what upgrade they are packing would make teamwork much easier. There is so much MISSING from this game's mechanics, which is baffling, as the devs have spent a lot of time and effort on the many ship classes. The carrier gameplay is dull. Incredibly dull. If you lose your fighters because your team didnt coordinate AA fire on the enemy fighters, then you are completely hobbled for the rest of the game as your bombers are picked off by the enemy. If you manage to succeed at gaining air superiority then be prepared for pointing bombers at targets on the map view for the whole game. To give you an idea: take Supreme Commander. Lock yourself to the most zoomed out view. Give yourself only 3 units. See how long it takes you to get bored. You essentially have WoW's Carrier game. There are a decent array of maps and gametypes, but they all play the same. There are objectives, but realistically they all boil down to deathmatch as the lack of a respawn means that if you knock out a battleship you're in a better position then capping the objective. So everyone just steams for an objective or two, the destroyers get knocked out first, then the battleships and cruisers arrive and slug it out. Every. Time.TLDR:A great base mechanic which invovles predicting the pace of enemies and positioning your ship which is unfortunately let down by a complete lack of creativity or style when it comes to the other mechanics.

This is an awful company you should think twice about throwing money at. WoT is notoriously infamous for it's inbalances and P2W policies. Gladly WoWS is not nearly as broken as WoT, but since we're talking about WG it's only a matter of time if you ask me. 2. Playerbase. It's not the toxicity, it's the unbelieveable incompetence that breaks the game, especially on weekends when all our beloved weekend warrios login. ""Blame the players, not the game"" is especially true in this game. Yes, the game is flawed, but ultimately what breaks the game is the people playing it. The second issue could easily be resolved by either implementing skill based MM or making ranked play more available (It's limited to short periods of time and specific tiers only).Unfortunately WG relies on those masses of extremely bad players, who godknowswhy oppose skill based MM, as source of income since the game is F2P, so nothing will change.

3e841121-5a7f-4dc7-af4f-2e7bedfa024e,4,"This review is from someone who is playing the japanese tech tree.Like the game, but the way you can go from a cruiser like the tenryuu and do completely fine match to match gaining 1000-2000xp per match to a battleship like the kawachi (which is concidered to be on the same teir) and be the least powerful ship in the battle, only gaining 400-600xp a match is rage inducing, it wouldn't be bad if you could skip the Kawachi and miyogi battleships by playing with the tenryuu but you can't. In order to unlock the other battleships you need to play as the kawachi first, this means you're the most disadvantaged player on the battlefield, most destroyers can literally beat you just by sniping you from miles away giving you no chance of ever hitting them. So you're literally forced to kamikaze as a battleship(Second biggest ships to aircraft carriers btw) hoping you do some damage or get a kill, then play on your phone until the battle finishes and finally you can repeat the process until maybe after an afternoon and ngiht you have a slightly better ship (The miyogi IV) which is still awful. You might say ""Well they offer premium ships"" and you'd be correct, I saw this option and decided to buy a tier IV class battleship(that severely outclasses any regular teir IV battleship i might add) for $6 to get myself on the ground and skip the awful grind of the kawachi, for about 6-7 hours i played as my new ship and had some of the most fun a warship game has ever given me, smooth controls, fast ship, accurate and long range weapons only to realize after gaining around 11,000xp that none of that can be spent on the tech tree unless you convert the XP with the in game purchased currency. Which is absurd seeing how i paid for the ship, now i have to pay to use the experience i gained with the ship? How is that fair, that solidates the fact i will never buy anything else on this game because the standard it sets is just purchasing your way through the teirs whenver you start losing too much. And i get why they make the frist few battleships difficult to grind through, because they know if it was as easy as just playing a tenryuu everyone would just play as the battleships. but still they're making their point way too hard. and the fact that i feel like Forrest Gumps shrimping boat could body me definitely rubs me the wrong way.

c5e2c23a-c86d-4d54-afc0-275f0f5b8f8b,1,"""[h1]Review of Call of Duty: World at War[/h1]\nWhen you search through the catalog of Call of Duty titles, your attention will frequently be brought to World at War. Considered to be one of the best WW2 entries in the franchise's history & equally the darkest. This is in one part thanks to the mature tone the game gives for its setting. Which is appropriate as the Second World War was the bloodiest conflict in Human history. However WW2 isn't new to CoD, so what else sets it apart? The coverage of the Pacific Theatre, greater focus & detail on the Eastern Front, introduction of the Zombies/Horde sub-mode to the franchise, stand-in prequel to the Black Ops series, and overall care for the source-material. \n\nBased directly on Call of Duty 4's updated engine (To the best of my knowledge) and was, at the time, the last official main line WW2 entry for many years. \n\n[u]Story/Campaign[/u]\nRather than choosing between separate campaigns, or ACTs, WaW's campaign is a consistent & consecutive 15 missions where you'll swap between perspectives. You'll play the role as Pvt.Miller in the Pacific Theatre, fighting against the Imperial Japanese throughout the American portion of the campaign (Which as far as I'm aware, is the first official time the Pacific Theatre was showcased in CoD). Here you'll witness the sheer brutality of the Japanese Empire, across multiple historic Pacific islands such as, but not limited to, Okinawa & Peleliu. \nOn the flip side, you'll take the role of Pvt.Dimitri Petrenko on the Eastern Front of the European Theatre throughout the Soviet side of the campaign. Alongside fan-favorite (And first time appearance) Viktor Reznov, against the fierce German war machine. From Stalingrad all the way to Berlin. \n\nNow while \""Fighting the Germans\"" is nothing new in Call of Duty, the actual story telling really makes it feel so. I prefer the gameplay diversity of the Pacific Theatre missions, but the characters and story of the Eastern Front missions are far more memorable. \n\nYou are never forced into relationships with other characters. With the exception of maybe Reznov. You merely standby and witness. This makes any deaths unforeseen, and gives them a grittier more realistic feeling, like the overall tone of the game. Backed by cutscenes being spliced with real-life footage (Just like the classic CoD games). \n\nThere are very minor alternate paths within the story, that based on your actions, can lead to different dialogue and a character death. Such as showing mercy or aggression throughout the Soviet campaign, & indirectly choosing who to save in the American campaign. \n\n[b]Additionally, the entire campaign can be played in Co-Op with multiple players. However 2 missions (Vendetta & Black Cats) are cut from Co-Op.[/b]\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThese games excel at linear map design. This is specifically setup to provide the player with a FPS cinematic experience, akin to an action movie. It's not for everyone, and can take away from some people's idea of replayability. For me, it's perfectly acceptable, as long as the experience itself is enjoyable, and personally, I adore CoD campaigns. I get immersed easily in their action set pieces and shooting galleries. Often times I'll even drop the difficulty to the lowest option just to smoothly play through the game as if I'm watching a film. With that being said, WaW does provide more content than just a campaign. \n|\nWithin missions, you can locate Death Cards, which are similar to Halo's Skulls. They provide additional challenge, ease, or even 'strange' to replaying the campaign. From regaining health by killing enemies, to infinite ammo. \n\nAnd let's not forget about Nazi Zombies, more on that later. \n\nAt its core, the gameplay is standard fare FPS stuff. You have a gun, you have a gallery of enemies to shoot, and cover to use as you progress. There's a wide variety of weapons across both theatres. Although I have to say that the movement animations are very stiff, some of the reloads included. The violence is not dumbed down either, you'll blow limbs off the enemy and watch them stumble around in shock. I also love that both the Pacific & Eastern Front campaigns have completely different ways of fighting. The Japanese use guerrilla tactics and surprise attacks, while the Germans are always on the defensive.\nAs per usual you will complete various objectives, such as placing explosives, taking down heavy armor with AT weaponry, etc. As well as the usual vehicle missions! This time around being a tank & aircraft mission. \nThough I would like to compare \""Blood & Iron\"" to \""Black Cats\"". The tank mission is incredibly minimalistic, and, even by CoD standards, unbelievable. You drive forward with a tank gun that fires every 2 seconds until the red crosshair on the entire German battalion of heavy tanks turns white. Meanwhile in the mission, \""Black Cats\"", you're cinematically switching gunner positions on a PBY aircraft, firing different calibres of MG's, taking control of 20mm cannons, landing to save sailors in the water, fighting against PT boats & enemy aircraft, all while the OST perfectly captures the feeling of adrenaline. \n\nDespite the positivity, I absolutely despise the sprint feature (Run 3 feet and then slow to a crawl), and by god the grenade spam in this game is awful. Even on the lowest difficulty, you'll die instantly to a grenade that hits your feet and explodes at the same time without the warning indicator getting a chance to appear. \n\n[u]Nazi Zombies[/u]\nOriginally a fun bonus mode unlocked after completing the campaign, soon turned into a full blown mini-franchise within almost every further release in the series. WaW and Black Ops in my opinion, have the purest Zombies mode. Simple survival with some clues to uncover a story. Earn points by killing zombies & repairing defenses, then use said points to bypass barriers, purchase weapons & upgrades via the mystery box or soda machines, etc. It's a very simple formula that you can play for hours across the 4 unique maps. \n\nIt's a fan-favorite, but personally isn't much for me anymore. It's not a dynamic survival horde mode. It has a set difficulty progression to it that devolves the gameplay after only a few rounds. \n\n[u]Multiplayer[/u]\nIncluded with the base game, and not a separate launcher like most other CoD titles, you get everything you'd expect here. I don't play it anymore really, but use to quite a bit. As long as you can find a server that's not modded or full of bot users, you'll get access to progression and classic CoD competitive shooting. \n\n[u]Soundtrack[/u]\nI have to give the OST its own section here. It's probably my favorite OST across any Call of Duty title. They are tracks that better reflect the gameplay, rather than the cinematic aspect of the story. S-Tier quality. \n\n[u]Additional Notes[/u]\nThe game can be modded, and is mostly used for user-made Nazi Zombies levels, multiplayer plugins, and sometimes upgrades to the main campaign. It is sad to hear that a British campaign was cut from the game, as well as a fighter aircraft mission.\n\n[h1]Conclusion (Pros & Cons)[/h1] \nCall of Duty: World at War is a must have for CoD & WW2 shooter fans alike. There's not many games like it right now, and it's hard to find a dark telling of the period that's not invaded with woke culture. I consider it my favorite Call of Duty game to date, although it often fights with MW2.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Gritty & Dark WW2\n+Pacific Theatre\n+Visuals that standup\n+Content variety\n+Nazi Zombies\n+Co-Op campaign\n+S-Tier OST\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\n~Short campaign\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Grenades, seriously\n\n\n[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]\nThank you for taking the time to read my review. Please remember, that this is just my opinion. We don't have to agree, one thing I love you may hate, and one thing I hate you may love. Hopefully this gave you an idea of what to expect. \n\n[b]Review lengths have been greatly compressed due to the character limit.[/b]""",Sat Jun 26 00:51:11 EEST 2021,3b23e390-13c7-4ad8-a095-0c844959f8c2

Overall, Last light is underated and for a mere 13-20 USD, well worth it for 10+ hours of immersive gameplay. \n\nMore in depth: The graphics are incredible, anyone with a decent rig + monitor should purchase this game to enjoy one of the most immersive games on the market. The game itself gives players a very solid linear FPS experience, one that can be finished in under 12 hours. I Played on hardcore mode, which proved to be very challenging and rewarding which is another aspect i loved from this game. I mean, having to fend of waves of Watchers while you try to run corners in dire attempts to recover health and tactically lay claymores while doing so. It gave me the kind of excitement that is somewhat lost in most FPS titles these days. In saying this however, waves of Watchers, Lurkers, Spiderbugs etc, seem to be a repeated process throughout the game. Waves of enemies can be exciting yes, but having to do so again and again definately diluted the fear factor associated mutant enemies to the point it became a predictable, repetitive process.\n\nOn another negative note, the characters that are met throughout the game arent really given much time to be developed to the point where the game is played for the story. It is understandable that a short linear FPS wont usually engage players with characters too much, however considering the seemingly complex storyline, the short interactions with key characters didnt do the storyline much justice.\nTo conclude,\nWhile the story itself isnt very memorable and the characters less so, the predictable gameplay mechanics paired with the highly immersive experience and excitable gameplay definately outweighed its negative aspects. Its a game worthy of 7.5/10 rating, however this review is possibly skewed by the fact the game was performed on a 780ti i5 rig with a 120hz monitor. Bear in mind that running with lower graphics will probably diminish the immersive value this game offers, which is its strongest point.""",Tue Jan 26 03:36:15 EET 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Only “hubs” that can only be reached by underground are dying.\nThere are tons of streets, squares, backyards, shops and apartments as well as sewers to explore. The possibility to get to inaccessible places via balconies or lifting platforms, to sneak past opponents or just to take a shortcut over the roofs is gigantic. The structure reminds me a bit of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/205100/]Dishonored[/url] only much nicer and much better.  Also the interiors are not quite as copy pasta as e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/704270/]Generation Zero[/url] and make the whole thing more believable. Regardless of which building it is, everything is just completely thought out and extreme attention was paid to all details so that you get the feeling that it could actually be a place in the near future. The game offers immense mobility in the sometimes extremely nested levels, but these are never really confusing.\n\nIn terms of play, Mankind Divided is, in my opinion, more aimed at players who do not necessarily want to shoot their way through the game armed to the teeth, but rather at those who want to penetrate a building unnoticed or secretly want to sneak into an enemy camp and get themselves also take the necessary time for the game. Unfortunately, the game has a few weaknesses here so that it happens that you are discovered, for reasons that are not yet apparent to me, or \""civilians\"" panic simply and for no reason and thus trigger an \""alarm\"".\nAt this point I would also like to briefly note that it is advisable to save the game status more often in the game. If you are looking for archivements, it will be much easier for you. A manual saving before you have reached your destination, for example, at which a conversation is triggered, has the advantage that if you screw it up and thus the side mission is not triggered, you can simply do it again.\n\n[b]Before you hack something[/b], you should always make sure that nobody is really around and can disturb you. The ambient noises are almost completely faded out during a hacking process and if you are then attacked by someone, it will be canceled immediately.\n[u]Regardless[/u] of the smaller weaknesses like one or the other logic error and the sometimes unwieldy controls, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is in my opinion an [b]excellent game with numerous (secondary) missions long playing time and a great replay value.[/b]\n\n[b]Jensens Storys:[/b]\nThe digital deluxe version also includes the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/470070/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided_DLC__Season_Pass/]Season-Pass[/url], which in my opinion is completely unnecessary except for the two story DLC's [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413360/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided__System_Rift/]System Rift[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/413370/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided_DLC__A_Criminal_Past/]A Criminal Past[/url], which come up with further side missions and achievements\n[b]If you value the story and the \""complete package\"", you should only play the expansions after the main story has been completed.[/b]\n\n[b]Breach:[/b]\nApart from the main story, there is also the breach mode. As far as I know, this is available [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/555450/Deus_Ex_Breach/]separately and free of charge[/url] on Steam and is already integrated in the Digital Deluxe Edition at Mankind Divided.\n[b]But there really isn't a story here.[/b]\nBreach is basically pure gameplay in a virtual environment or in a computer program or, to put it more simply, a pure hacking game in which you have to steal data cores and infiltrate networks.\nCan be fun and is a good change from the main game. \nUnfortunately, Breach has an [u]online compulsion[/u] that you cannot avoid.\nThose who collect achievements can be happy if they have Mankind Divided and Breach in their library.

c2c55ab5-b8af-47a6-a12f-1cc20619fb1f,4,"""A cowboy game that really lets you horse around, pun intended. Unless it's the story missions. \n\nTL;DR: It's really good, but the gameplay is at odds with the story, which could have probably been shorter. \nIf you like wild west media in general or open world games, it's definitely worth a try even if you are just going to mess around and not finish a story(only 20.3% of people did on Steam actually). \n\nVisually, it's (mostly) beautiful, especially considering how huge the open world is, with some worse textures here and there. A lot of care went into animations, the cutscene animations are especially worth mentioning, and many little details that make the world seem more lived in. Apparently horse balls shrink in the cold, but as I am not weird, I haven't actually checked.  Though admittedly, being an 2018 game, it's showing some age. \nIt's also worth mentioning that game uses checkerboard-rendering, which causes visible artifacts in hair and fur. The only solutions are to either use TAA(which makes everything blurry and makes it look worse) or much higher rendering resolution. The DLSS isn't that amazing in this game and makes the hair artifacts worse.\nSound-wise, I have nothing wrong to say about this, everything is essentially perfectly spot on.\n\nThe gameplay by itself is good, though dated with some more immersive elements like looting animations or skinning or animal as well as some survival mechanics such as eating. The survival mechanics are pretty shallow and really more for some immersion like I said or minor roleplaying.\nWhat also helps roleplaying is really wide array of customization options - hair, beard(both growing in real time) or clothes. And boy, there is a huge variety of clothes to choose from as well, so you can play the cowboy dress-up game too if you want to.\nThe world is beautiful, with a lot to hunt and explore. It has quite a few side story missions that are usually pretty funny and nice diversion from the main plot. \n\nThe story is about a gang of more noble outlaws during the ending years of the Wild West, as the country was becoming more and more civilised. The fact that you can't fight the progress and change is a large thematic part of the game, whether it's the the law trying to end the outlaw life, or the gang itself being against old values such as slavery.\nIt's well written for the most of it, but sometimes characters killing 40-50 people during as story missions feels really off for the kind of story it's trying to tell. Other times there are some AWFUL story conveniences that are just straight up irritating with villains escaping in awkward manner. \nThough that did sound more negative than positive, the story is definitely worth experiencing, though could probably be bit shorter to be paced better.\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer component, as I heard it's pretty grindy and I already have an actual job, so yeah.\nIf you can buy it on sale, which is lately usually 50% off, it's a really good deal. I don't think I'd want to pay 60 for it.""",Mon Jan 10 19:18:15 EET 2022,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5
c2c55ab5-b8af-47a6-a12f-1cc20619fb1f,2,"I cannot advise against playing this game enough. This is not a good game, and the publisher/developer behind it is not worth supporting. This game sells a power fantasy to the highest bidder and keeps people engaged through the same triggers as a slot-machine.In short: The game itself suffers from horrendous balance issues and blatant pay-to-win problems. The developers have consistently been deceiving, insulting, and even threatening the playerbase. The game is player-vs-player focused. It features ships from various points in time. There is a progression system for advancing up tiers in a tech-tree. There are numerous different tech trees for different nations. You earn credits and XP from battles - winning, killing ships, dealing damage, capturing objectives, and spotting enemies all award you varying amounts of credits and XP. In a battle, you can have ships of various nations and various types distributed amongst 2 teams. Furthermore, you can have ships of varying tiers. Up to tier 4, you will always either be in a highest tier ship or only ships one tier above yours in the battle. Starting at Tier 5, ships can be up to 2 tiers higher than yours. The higher tier the ships, the more powerful they are. So the game is inherently designed around you wanting to get to higher tier ships, so you can more easily beat your opponents. If you are in a Tier 10 cruiser facing off against a Tier 8 cruiser, you will probably win - same if you are in a Tier 10 Destroyer, Battleship, or Aircraft Carrier. You can either try to make the most of your ship and let yourself be pummled over and over again by higher tier ships (with the occasional game where you are the one beating the lower-tier enemies), or you can pay money to skip past lower tier ships rather quickly and directly upgrade to higher tier ships. The higher your tier ship, the better the odds of you being in a top-tier match. However, ship progression is far from the only progression present in the game. In fact, it's probably one of the least important progression systems present in the game. What probably amounts to the most important progression system is the captain system. On any ship, you can slot a captain. This captain gains XP along with your ship - and once you accrue enough XP, you unllock a skill point for him to spend. These captain skills are incredibly powerful - making your ship that has a seasoned veteran just straight up better than the equal tiered opponents you face that do not have a captain of their own to match yours. If you wish to advance to a ship and take your captain along, your captain suffers what is called ""retraining"". During this time, you need to play with the captain on your ship to grind out XP to ""familiarize"" him with the new ship. The problem? The more you invested into your captain before, the longer retraining takes on a new ship. Except you can spend money to by-pass this problem entirely. Keep in mind that these captain skills are not trivial. There are entire ship classes (like destroyers or light cruisers) for whom these captain skills are essential to deal damage and survive. Without the correct captain skills, they are simply anemic XP and credit Pinatas for the enemy team. Additionally, Wargaming (the developer/publisher) has  the habit of continously powercreeping content with new ships released. That means that unless you invest an unfeasible amount of time into this game or fork over vast quantities of money, the line you are grinding will easily be obsolete in a few months, displaced by something that is just straight up better. They will milk the paying players for money and let them have overpowered ships for a few months. They eventually nerf these ships once the people who are likely to spend money to get them have done so, and then announce a new line a month or two later that will repeat the cycle. Additionally, this game features premium consumables and premium ships. Premium consumables are buy-for-each-battle items, that are direct upgraded versions over regular consumables. You can either pay exorbitant, non-sustainable amounts of in-game credits for, or you can pay real money for premium account time, premium camoflagues, buy in-game currency, or premium currency, all of which enable you to continously use these consumables. Premium ships are ships that you can only attain by paying money for them. They are virtually never changed from their initial state. They are typically released along with new ship lines. This means that while newly released regular ships are just as good as the premium counterparts, the premium ships will remain overpowered, while the regular ships are subject to balance changes. Just think about that; if you pay real money for a ship, it will never be nerfed. In a PvP game. When players point out the disparity between regular ships and premium ships, the developers will do any combination of the following things:    Remove the ship from sale, but not the game - usually with a ""buy now before you can't"" announcement  Degrade the players for ""just being bad"" and ""not being good"" (a blatant lie - the premium ships are just superior in stats)  Censor threads and videos calling them out, and even threaten legal action. None of this even addresses the combat in this game, which is absolutely attrocious. All guns you shoot in this game have dispersion. Absolutely staggering amounts of dispersion. We are talking ""divine intervention"" levels of dispersion here. (https://youtu.be/0Ae6B7C05Nk?t=1m6s) You can be randomly one-shot from a single shell striking your ship. Fires and flooding (damage over time effects) are based off of chance. And you can pay real money to skew the chances in your favor. ""Oh boy, will the salvo I just fired instantly obliterate that ship over there?"" The sound effects in the game itself mirror those you might hear on slot machines. Big explosions, sounds effects, and all. This game is fundamentally manipulative, deceiving, and exists to give a power fantasty to those willing to pony up the cash. I would go so far as to label it and its makers as evil. Please, do not play this.",Sun Dec 05 03:19:56 EET 2021,86f49d86-074f-4a2f-88f6-2df9bc277837
c2c55ab5-b8af-47a6-a12f-1cc20619fb1f,3,"""[b]Metro: Last Light is a light that burns twice as bright but does not burns half as long[/b]\n \n\t4 years ago, Ukraine based developer [i]4A Games[/i] released [i]Metro 2033[/i], pleasantly surprising many gamers and critics with the richly eloquent and immersive ambience of the [i]Metro[/i] experience. While the game was far from perfect, the community nonetheless basked in the distinct Russian flavour of the setting, characters, and outlook represented in its post-apocalyptic world, passionately adapted from [i]Dmitry Glukhovsky’s[/i] novel of the same title.\n\n\tIn [i]Metro[/i], the metaphorical strife of humanity against its darker, self-destructive nature were often presented in true, unyielding gritty terms. Depictions of huddled humanity striving against the desolation of the new world, not for survival but for the basic sense of normality and security were disturbingly overlaid with images of violent fanaticism and unforgiving death. Death by the creatures of the new world and by left and right winged fanatics.\n\n\tAs a highly cinematic game, based on a series of novels, [i]Metro: Last Light's[/i] meat is in the story. Almost the entirety of my commendation for this franchise originates from the story-driven experience, so discussing the way in which the story is told seems like the most appropriate place to start. The game prioritizes on the human experience as the lead method of story telling, making it a unique and enriching experience. From the very beginning in which the series’ protagonist, Artyom, awakens to his call to adventure, it is abundantly clear that an intricate level of attention has been dedicated to detail that could only hope to be achieved by a group of developers with a genuine love for their subject matter. Extremely excessive yet altogether human interactions, like the ability to play your musical instruments, or turn off the room lights before moving out, build a sense of empathy by allowing the player to project very normal impulses onto the first person perspective. Every time you find yourself in a surviving human settlement, there are a myriad of opportunity to take a break from the violent chaos of the unforgiving new world and listen to the personal stories and woes of the Metro survivors; All told in richly voiced and detailed animated discussions. These little things add depth and immersion to [i]Metro: Last Light[/i], all the while giving an insight of the life in the Metro. Even when you are out on your own traversing the wastelands, the bulk of the game’s survival mechanics are built around an immersive sense of physicality. For example, players will need to manually replace their gas mask filters, charging their kinetic powered torch light by using a pump and wipe dirt and mud from their visor.\n\n\tThe rich and detailed story is well accompanied by the breathtaking beauty of the game's graphics engine and art. The level of gaming design provides an ultra-realistic environment gives the player the added advantage of situational awareness. For example, tracking enemy numbers and movement by merely observing the shadows cast on the walls. Players will be able to traverse the underground Metro stations, both surviving human settlements and settlements which did not survive an attack by the creatures of the new world. Players will also be able to witness the quaint, post-apocalyptic beauty of the nuclear wasteland of what once was Moscow, the Red Square and Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\n\tThe gameplay is fairly straight forward and linear. The linearity of the game is well executed as it stays focussed on the story and tasks at hand, not deviating too much from the imperative nature of Artyom's mission. However, the game does allow room for exploration and rewards you for doing so. Such rewards include ammo, gas mask filters, and even new weapons. The combat system is very interesting because you are given a choice in play style. One way to play it is like a typical modern shooter with guns blazing. A ton of arsenal is still at your disposal. From the pre-apocalypse Kalashnikov rifles, to Metro engineered shotguns and submachine guns. The game also allows weapons customization like adding silencers, laser sights and weapons optics. However, it should be noted that ammo is very scarce in the Metro, so tactical approaches to any combat situations are a must, adding another level of realism into the game. Another way to play it is by sticking to the shadows like a ghost as you pass through enemy settlements. This is the way I recommend playing the game because it will grant you more instances to stop and listen to the characters' stories and gain further insights to life in the Metro. It will grant you a heightened sense of satisfaction and accomplishment at the end of your journey, should you choose to play it this way. However, there will be instances where you cannot sneak past the enemies, but this is where it gets interesting, because you are given to choice to either slit the enemy's throat or just knock him out. Do you think there is already enough death and suffering in the Metro? Or do you think the wicked should be cleansed from the new world? The choice is entirely up to the player.\n\n\t[i]Metro: Last Light[/i] possesses a wealth of passion for its subject matter that is promising for the future of [i]4A Games[/i]. Playing it is like reading a book, written in the first person, where the author uses incredible and poetic descriptive language for every little thing that the protagonist encounters. In a world that is filled with misery and death, it is up to the player to decide if Artyom should add more misery and death to the world, or to salvage the last remnants of good in the wreckage of humanity. [i]Metro: Last Light[/i] does not want players to just enjoy the combat (or stealth), but also to learn something, to feel something out of it. What you ask? I think it wants us to question the human condition and ponder about the value and meaning of our lives before we inevitably succumb to our destructive nature.""",Thu Dec 10 10:42:50 EET 2020,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

I don't need another only to start over from scratch. Uninstalled.... Back to original client...Edit: Since people would rather have my opinion of the game. I will say this. The game is definitely worth playing. Don't get me wrong. Great graphics, great strategic gameplay, and plenty of ships to grind on various beautiful looking maps. I've played this game on and off for years, (Since Closed Alpha), and I will continue to play it. World of warships as a whole gets my Recommended rating. The fact that veteran players who have been asking for steam integration for years, are forced to create a new account is absolute crap. Sure, you can do some majic, delete some files, and poof you can log into your account. Having to go about it that way, shows me the devs are lazy if you can go around easily bypassing their forced steam login. But that's no surprise there I guess, though Wargaming overall I've always supported in one way or another. But the decision to make the Steam Client and the WoWs client was a poor decision in my opinion. Just splits and spreads the playerbase out on more servers that can't even cross play with one another. I do hope to see some improvements in the future.

It still has many, many servers full, however they are someone specific to certain modes and you're unlikely to find a server with a less common gamemode. TL;DR, I love this game and cant recommend it enough.\n\nSays up there somewhere ^^^ that i have 19 or so hours on record, but I have played much, much more on my PS4 and have only made the move to PC recently. so i think im qualified to write a review lol\n\nThe campaign is fun, nothing too special but definitely alright to just sit down and play, it has a somewhat interesting story and still feels battlefield-y to me. You even get multiplayer bonuses for it, too! I would rate the campaign a Good 7/10, would recommend but nothing too special.\n\nNow, the multiplayer is where shit it at! Content wise, pfft content wise. Theres so much shit in this game. Gun wise, theres plenty. No matter your playstyle, there will be a gun for you. M416 for offensive medium-rage engagements, MP7 for close quarters combat, AEK-971 if you're a sweatlord, and Mare's Leg if you're based. The maps are fun, couple of my favourites are Dragons Valley 2015, Dawnbreaker, and Operation Locker. Theres plenty as long as you have the premium edition, and there aren't any (in my opinion) that are bad maps and should just be skipped. A lot of the playerbase has been playing for years, so it might seem to take a while to get into it and be on a similar skill level, but really it only takes a minute to get good at the gunplay and movement and you'll be facing off anyone in notime. Vehicles still seem a little too overpowered, but can certainly be dealt with. Tanks are really fun to play, helicopters are speedy and dangerous, and planes go woosh. Destruction wise, it's pretty great. Siege of Shanghai's tower falling is a pretty big staple of this game, and every time it goes down it's definitely something to see. Unfortunately, most maps get a little worse after the \""levolution\"". Smaller things like houses being destructible are definitely fun. Running from a tank and taking cover in a building, only for the wall to get blown open is cool as hell. Hopefully you didn't die tho lmao. It's especially cool to see maps, like Golmud Railway, before and after, as the after is usually almost entirely flattened.

A small handful of the population managed to seek shelter in the subway tunnels beneath the city. Twenty years have passed, the world has become inhabited with mutants and the surviving population has broken up into various factions.\n \nFeaturing a strong narrative and great pacing, Metro will keep you immersed the entire time. The story is told through eyes of a ranger named Artyom and not through irritating and pacing-breaking cutscenes like a lot of other games. Journal entries can also be found and Artyom serves as a narrator who often talks about the events unfolding around him.\n \nIt’s the direct sequel to Metro 2033 but playing the first title isn’t required to enjoying the game.\n \nMetro Last Light tries to do a bit of everything, it’s primarily a first person shooter but it incorporates stealth elements very well. It also feels like a survival horror at points and can be quite tense when you venture out onto the irradiated surface with a gas mask. The audio is great and the screams of mutants in the distance will always keep you on the edge of your seat. There is a fairly large variety of enemies which are all hideous, unique and well done.\n \nThe atmosphere is amazing, same with the graphics. It’s worth noting that a somewhat powerful computer is required to running Metro Last Light. I was able to run the game at 1920 x 1080 on Very High at around 70FPS average with an Intel i5 3470K Processor, 16gbs of RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 560TI. I have heard that the game does have some issues with certain ATI cards though which can be fixed by turning off Physx in the settings.\n \nMetro Last Light also has multiple endings and plenty of re-playability. It may appear linear early on but it quickly branches out later allowing plenty of room for exploration.\n \nFor a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsPrciV5i2U\n \nMetro Last Light also managed to make our Top 35 List for the best games of the generation.

That is a lie and doesn't change the review's conclusion at all. Each game update will force you to re-do the ""fix"" and you don't get any of the steam advantages / achievements. In other words, you end up having a bastardised version of the game ""through Steam"", which at the end is worse than just downloading it outside of Steam.",Mon Jul 12 07:55:07 EEST 2021,86f49d86-074f-4a2f-88f6-2df9bc277837

f8b3b529-eebd-4d62-9fd4-e1410e3b8b2d,7,"TL;DR: ""Realistic"" long primary ranges hurt class balance and result in slow and passive gameplay, and no one seems to care.The bulk of my time in-game was spent on the standalone verison, not the steam version. Only downloaded the steam verison for convenience.The game is very visually impressive, i don't think i've seen anything more beautiful in a vido game than firing a full broadside in a battleship, or having your machine guns light up enemy aircraft.The issue i have is the gameplay. PvP is extremely passive, slow and unfun, for me at least. Wargaming seems to have an inconsistant method of applying ""realism"" to the game. They make the ranges for primary guns realistic (but not the sceondaries, for example) to the detriment of gameplay.WoWs is devided into 4 classes. A generalist class, being the Cruiser, a Support Class, being the Aircraft Carriers, and 2 Specialist Classes, being the Destroyers and Battleships, holding the roles of Harassers/Pickers and Tanks respectivly.Battleships, the ""tank"" class, has the highest Armor and Health, and the most powerful Primary Guns, as well as a large compliment of secondary guns for use at close range. A big issue here is that Batlleships primaries are also the longest ranged weapons in the game, which is realistic, but feeds into a few major issues. A High-Health class with that has a long-ranged attack is, by nature of the long range weapons, encouraged to hang back at maxium range to pick people off with the high burst-damage attacks, rather than push in and brawl with opponents at close range, as the secondary armament, as well as the supposed teamplay and counterbalance between Battlehsips and other classes such as the more versitile curiser would entail. From this you might conclude that battleships are Overpowered, but, removing thier range advantage, they're really not. With thier pluses comes their minuses. Battleships have the tankiest armor and health, but also have poor speed and trash manuverabaility. Thier Primaries are powerful sources of damage, but require a long time to reload inbetween shots, generally around 30 seconds per shot, and turn extremely slowly. Secondaries provide useful support damage at close range, but can *only* fire at close range, and are very innacurate, especially against small a nimble destroyers.All these weaknesses would be very exploitable in close-range battles, but because the Battleship's long range can allow it to sit well outside close range battles, rendeirng all these weaknesses irrelavant. Slow reload time and turret turn speed would hurt a brawling Battleship's ability to respond to new targets attacking at different directions, but because the Battleship is at long range, there's only ever one direction it needs to face. New targets are always a quick couple of degrees of turn away. Anything past that, and you're out of position, and will get focused or ambushed to death. Poor secondary range and accuracy is only a factor to consider if secondaries are given the oppuritunity to fire, which a Battleship at long range never provide. That minor extra damage isn't considered worth pushing forward to get focused by enemy long-range fireCruisers are the generalist class, supposedly good at everything, but not *great* at anything. It's medium damage, but fast-reloading primaries ideally would make great support fire for allied ships in brawls, being particularly decent at attacking destroyers, and chiping away at Battleships with fire damage form explosive shells, as well as providing specialized anti-air support against enemy fighters. The long range of battles hurts Cruisers, however.Cruisers have less range than thier Battleships counterparts, and so generally play second fiddle to them if they are present, relying on numbers advantages to attack enemy Battleships, since they cannot take advantage of map terrain due to the longer range, and so sit at a ""meh"" grade of power in the game.Destroyers, the Picker and Harasser class, are represented as the rock-paper-scissors counter to Battleships, which they are... at close range. Thier torpedos deal heavy, heavy damage depsite being slow-moving, which battleships (and some larger cruisers) at close range are generally unable to avoid very easily. But because, like we've well established by now, Battleships, and now Cruisers have no reason to come into close range, Destroyers are relegated to a vulture role of patiently wiating behind map terrain waiting for someone to overextend so they can be ambushed, since closing the distance regularly is a harder task. Destroyers have the highest manuverability and speed of any ship class in the game, as well as the smallest and thus hardest-to-hit profile, which gives them an advantage at avoiding slow-moving enemy shells at a distance, as well as the ability to deploy a smokescreen to provide artificial cover for themselves and teammates, but all of trivial effect if they are not within fighting range to begin with. All it takes is one lucky Battleship volley to take down a lightly-armored destroyer, and if an enemy destroyer at range is always inside an enemy Battleship's line-of-sight, a hit will happen at some point.Aircraft carriers, the indirect fire support class, are affected by the range issue in both ways. By nature of controlling planes in an rts-like fahsion, Carriers have the freedom to sit at extreme ranges, letting thier planes quickly fly to thier targets over the heads of allied ships, exceeding the range of even battleships by technicality. Carriers however, have no primary guns with which to defend themselves, armed with only secondary guns, if any at all, making them very vunerable to focus fire when in-range of an enemy, and so, like battleships, are encouraged to sit at maximum range, generally behind an island, or at the edge of the map. This is an issue in a couple ways. Firstly, it causes aircaft support to have long periods of downtime, as planes must travel long distances to and from thier target, reducing thier ability to play the game, and relegating aircraft to an ocasional danger to outliers in the group, rather than a near-constant threat that affects player positioning and movement, even if Aircraft are a powerful weapon. The second issue is that, again, carriers have poor abilities to defend themselves, and so, unless guarded by an escort willing to take themselves out of the battle, are essentially screwed if any enemy ship - generally destroyers - finds them at thier end of the map; Carriers are unable to recieve the passive support of thier teammates due to the danger of ranged focus fire, and so in turn are less able to support thier teammates.For these reasons, I personally find PvP to be very stale, passive and unfun. Matches very often pass the 20 minute limit due to how slow games are. I personally find Co-Op and PvE gamemodes to be more enjoyable, for the simple reason that Bots aren't afriad to be agressive. In PvE gamemodes, a double-broadside of secondary fire is not uncommon, and gameplay is more dymaic by way of taking advantage of the map layout. But due to how dumb/easy bots are, and due to the reduces rewards you get from PvE modes means your progrssion is going to be painfully slow unless you play a lot of PvP, which, for the pace it has, does not really interest me.And, attempting to discuss the issues (that i find are issues at least) in the community has, in my experience, generally been met with indifference or been provided with non-answers such as ""get good"", and the developers don't seem to be in a position to change thier game on these issues, probably due to popularity issues in the echo-chamber compettitive/higher tier players.Play it if you like playing slow, passive games i suppose.",Sat Sep 19 03:53:02 EEST 2020,1ecec3cb-048c-4f0d-b89d-e1a92a3fa773

The world they created is so realistic and so are its problems, you can look at the present world and this fictional future and it looks totally believable and relative to our own problems nowadays.\nWhen it comes to gameplay. Stealth, this is as good as it gets, to put it simply there are so many ways to approach a situation that every one can have their cup of tea.\nThis particular game has pretty short main campaign but the amount of side content makes up for it in my opinion. Which also in my opinion belongs to 'highest quality side content' section of RPG rankings. The side quests perfectly fit in the world and the conflicts that the main campaign is dealing with seamlessly. The characters are so well written and unique, the writing overall is pretty good.

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Sat Jul 31 05:40:02 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

The world they created is so realistic and so are its problems, you can look at the present world and this fictional future and it looks totally believable and relative to our own problems nowadays.\nWhen it comes to gameplay. Stealth, this is as good as it gets, to put it simply there are so many ways to approach a situation that every one can have their cup of tea.\nThis particular game has pretty short main campaign but the amount of side content makes up for it in my opinion. Which also in my opinion belongs to 'highest quality side content' section of RPG rankings. The side quests perfectly fit in the world and the conflicts that the main campaign is dealing with seamlessly. The characters are so well written and unique, the writing overall is pretty good.

You play as Artyom, a ranger in the metro. In the last game, Artyom launched a missile strike against a race of seemingly hostile mutants called the Dark Ones. However it turns that the Dark Ones were making an attempt to communicate with the humans. Throughout the course of this game, you attempt to track down the last remaining Dark One, which brings to light a brewing conflict between the factions of the metro.\n\nSPOILER FREE FROM HERE\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it is mainly stealth based when fighting human enemies. Most of the levels are fairly dimly light, and you are able to turn off many light sources. This helps greatly, as you are almost completely undetectable when you are in the dark. A nice addition is that your watch has an indicator as to whether you are visible or not. You also have a choice of killing or knocking our enemies, but I have not found a difference between the two other than the animation. \n\nWhen fighting mutants, the game becomes more survival-horrorish, with ammo being scarce and enemies hiding in the shadows. Gameplay becomes very similar to Alan Wake, as using your flashlight can ward off and expose the weak spots of baddies.\n\nThere are a few sections of the game which take place on the surface. These usually consist of you being beaten to a pulp by mutants. Many of these areas also suffer from terrible level design. One such level, in which I had to collect gasoline to power a tram, was almost impossible to navigate, as much of it is covered in water, and you are unable to swin past falling into water and pulling yourself back out. This can become very disorenting, as you pull yourself back onto the ledge from which you fell off without turning around, leaving you wondering if you climbed onto the ledge in front of you.\n\nIn terms of weaponry, the game keeps it pretty simple. Pistols, shotguns, assault rifiles, SMGs, and sniper rifiles are your choices, although I almost never found myself in a situation where a sniper would be useful. All of these weapons can be customized with a variety of attachments, some of which being a little ridiculous. At one point in the game, I found a quadruple-barreled shotgun. All of the items in the game are bought with military-grade ammunition, which can be used for your weapons in a pinch.\n\nAll in all, Metro: Last Light is a generally well done first person shooter with a few inherent flaws. \n\nI give it an 8 out of 10.""",Sun Jan 02 06:53:07 EET 2022,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Actually, in the beginning you get better ships faster than your skill improves.Sure, later on XP and credit accumulation is slow, but again this game is enjoyable at all levels, so unless you the 'endgame' guy, just kick back and go with the slow flow.I did spend around $10 to support the devs, and it is useful for getting ship slots so that I don't need to sell low-tier ships (as I progress) I'm still enjoying.Talking about slow flow, this is a great PVP shooter with a relaxed pace, especially with larger ships. Tactics, situational awereness and careful aim are key, not reflexes.As with all team-play based PVP games, you do get into bad teams - it is what it is, not the game's fault. But in general I think the community is decent.Graphics, music is fantastic, well optimized game. Servers are great, matchmaking is fast.Love of these magnificent ships can be certainly felt, there are dev-made historical videos on YT - there is a fair chance you will get interested in the topic.

9a7eef15-fd94-4d94-be95-ced51e73d08e,3,"""[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\n9/10: Almost everything the player expects from a AAA game made by Rockstar. It's just a shame that a few bugs, flawed honor system, flawed crime reporting, and short story prevent [i]Red Dead Redemption 2[/i] from being perfect in spite of improvements in other areas.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n\nDoes a AAA game that's a few years old really need a review? Ol' Il Pallino has his gripes and the founder of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25150682/]REXCurse (REXnetwork)[/url] needs more reviews, so may as well! The people who need a description of [i]Red Dead Redemption 2[/i] are the same people who will never read this review. Set in 1899 (roughly twelve years before the first [i]Red Dead Redemption[/i]) the story of the Van der Linde Gang starts with main character Arthur Morgan as the only lieutenant to Dutch Van der Linde who takes his gang through a misadventure through multiple (and mostly new) states in hopes of being able to pull off that one perfect heist so everyone in the gang can retire from their life of crime. Of course with the contents of the first [i]Red Dead Redemption[/i], it's pretty obvious that the Van der Linde Gang never comes close to this accomplishment. About the only real unexpected surprises are the stranger missions and new features.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nNormally this category wouldn't apply to a AAA game, but it is unforgivable for a game with such a high budget to have floating rocks encountered (albeit infrequently) along with the occasional floating character.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2678987508\n\nHowever, [i]Red Dead Redemption 2[/i] does have a really cool graphical effect that sometimes occurs in shootouts, and usually whenever headshots are scored.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2690928461\n\nThe sounds, however, were faultless, and the game's soundtrack was perfect for the late 19'th. century with a score of original music. (One song was even performed by Willie Nelson.)\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n\nThe biggest positive to [i]Red Dead Redemption 2[/i] is that the game is a dramatic improvement over the first game on account of the improvement to horses. Horses have four levels of bonding (five if level zero is included) and increases in levels unlocks horse skills and increases health (hit points) and stamina. Horses can have their looks customized, and new saddles can not only be purchased, but new saddles can also be crafted by trappers located on various parts of the map. (More on that in a minute.)  On the downside, horses can now be spooked by predators, and there's a chance that a horse (especially at a lower bonding level) will buck the player off and leave them to deal with a predator whom the player will hopefully have enough time to activate deadeye and put a bullet in it's head.\n\nUnlike the outfit ensembles in [i]Red Dead Redemption[/i], the player has the ability to truly customize the outfits of the main character in the event they see something they'd like to mix and match with clothes that can be bought from tailors and general stores, along with clothes that can be unlocked at a trapper's shop by selling snakeskins, hides, pelts, and feathers to a trapper. The best saddles in the game can also be purchased at a trapper's shop.\n\nDeadeye has also been improved with one new level of deadeye allowing the player to shoot and remain in deadeye without painting any targets, which is particularly useful in the event the player is using a sniper rifle.\n\nThe concept of animals needing to be taken down with a specific type of weapon makes hunting more interesting than the first game, and makes all the difference between good and perfect condition. (With enough overkill, an animal or snake carcass can drop from perfect to poor condition.) The game also introduces a bow and arrows, and specialty arrows can be crafted and used to kill game in one shot (if aimed perfectly) and keep it's condition perfect.\n\nAlso on the issue of hunting, players do not have to skin what they killed for the most part. If the player wants to have more food (at the expense of sacrificing it's outer layer or feathers) for either themselves or their camp, an intact animal carcass can be stowed on a horse. (Animal carcasses can also be sold to butchers and trappers.) In fact, several decorations can be crafted at the camp require an entire carcass.\n\nFishing has also been added to the game, and is a nice activity to engage in to help add variety to whenever the player doesn't wanna do story missions, go hunting, complete challenges, or whatever. Apart from being a food source, fish meat that's classified as [i]gritty[/i] can be used with berries to make [i]potent predator bait[/i] that can either be used to attract perfect quality predators or sold for money. While it is advised to catch fish with the fishing rod that unlocks fairly early into the story, ol' Il Pallino caught his first fish by shooting at it. (Fish can also be \""caught\"" by throwing dynamite into a body of water.)\n\nWeapons can now be customized in a plethora of ways. Some ways are useful in that they make weapons function better and degrade slower, but most are purely aesthetic.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2678987240\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2678987240\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n\nThe biggest negative is that the honor system is flawed and does not recognize acts of self-defense. While honor can be built easily enough by greeting everyone in the game's biggest city (along with catching and returning fishes) it is annoying to have people shooting at you and lose honor because you killed them in retaliation. Plenty of members of the rival O'Driscoll Gang can be encountered in the town of Valentine, and a few times ol' Il Pallino managed to get a bounty for getting into a non-lethal fight with some of those jackwagons. Unlike other criminal organizations, people strangely care if they see the player looting an O'Driscoll and can expect a bounty just for making an encounter worth their while if said encounter is in the Valentine area.\n\nWhile not affecting honor directly, ol' Il Pallino saw some game to shoot at in the outskirts of Emerald Ranch, and a freakin' dog attacked him. Again, self-defense wasn't recognized when the dog instigated a kill or be killed situation.\n\nWhile complaining about aesthetics, it may be unfair to complain that Arthur Morgan's (plain) default hat always takes up an inventory slot on the horse, and cannot be changed. Hat accessories to Arthur's hat also count as an entirely different hat, but this is problematic since ol' Il Pallino's favorite hat is not Arthur's default hat!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2692502024\n\nRockstar Games has been making games featuring Blackjack since 2004, and *STILL* do not treat a ten to be any different from a face card in regards to hitting a blackjack. (This works out if it's the player who hit an ace and a ten, but the dealer can also get blackjack with a ten instead of a face card.)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684623336\n\nThere are bugs that are game-breaking. Ol' Il Pallino has a friend who's experience was ruined by bugs, but the only game-breaking bug that was encountered personally was once getting accidentally stuck on a stagecoach and needed to quit just to get unstuck. (An inexcusable bug for so much as a tiny indie game.)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2674853387\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nFun fact: If the player steals a wagon transporting oil, they can sell it for $50 instead of the usual $40.\n\n[h1]The honest word of Il Pallino... OR ELSE![/h1]\n\nThis review provided independently by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25150682/]REXCurse (REXnetwork)[/url].\n\nNo compensation was provided.\n\nEmail contact@dnbmedia.co for requests & promotions.""",Mon Oct 19 20:57:02 EEST 2020,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

How do you feel?Unlike many other games, maybe WG staffs enjoy too much time in their Russian legal system, they DO actively use these ""rights"". And I am one of the victims to their arbitrariness. According to their exceptionally high language moral standard, WG considers saying two sentences twice per battle (and each battle ranges from 10 min to 20 min) as spamming, not abusive or advertising or political or religious or whatever reason you might suspect, but effing S P A M M I N G. And WG used this ""reason"" to chat ban me.OK, chat banned, no problem. So I contacted the supporting staff to remove the ban. Do they have the authority or ability to remove the ban? Sure, I have seen some other players' chat ban been relieved after contacting supporting guys. But this time, the supporting guy (A*** M*****) said they were incapable to remove chat bans.So that guy obviously lied about what they can do, and I pointed it out. You guess what happened? WG simply said, WG wouldn't talk about whether he lied or not, but two sentences twice per battle is SPAMMING and that deserves a chat ban. And by the way, I was suspended from the game 3 days for unsportsmanship even tho I did not violate any WG's rules (https://worldofwarships.com/en/news/gamestuff/anti-abuse-system/) about unsporting conducts.OHHH nice, pointing out they are lying and they get me game banned.

9bed0250-0629-4c26-b7b8-d4892aeb8557,1,"I've been playing this game extremely casually for the past years, that means a few hours a day to once every 2-3 months.I have to say this is the best naval battles game out there by far, if there even is a competitor. If you are drawn to it by KantaiCollection like me, you will marginally be disappointed but nevertheless still impressed by it, and hey the mods can fix your addiction, even through the mods are of extremely poor quality, the limitations placed on them are a factor i presume, for me slapping kancolle(and other) art on ship skins is indeed poor quality.While all is good and the game is satisfying to play, WarGaming themselves are taking it in the wrong direction since the beginning and that shows, part of it has to do with insane 40 to 60 euro prices for ONE premium ship, the only vanilla skin in the game so far is the Bismark skin which you cant get anymore, and camouflages which are a consumable that pretty much ruin the look of ships to me. They have done a good job with the Halloween event ship skins for one mission available during halloween, but that is it. Personally i feel like ships skins and maybe even voice packs(preferably in cooperation with kantai collection team) would be the right direction instead of ultra expensive ships.Okay aside from that, you got premium account benefits which frankly are equivalent to nothing. Let me put it like this, the major problem you will inevitably face is buying a new ship which requires EXP obtained only and only by the previous ship in a line of tiers to unlock the next tier, and game currency to buy the next ship. The EXP itself is a massive grind you have to go through at high tiers, especially for casual players ( i play for 2 and now close to 3 years casually and i still only just got to tier 9 out of 10, getting to 10 is much harder due to: read on), and CREDITS(game currency) the game offers you a insane ammount at the start to buy your ships, this will take you to atleast tier 7 maybe as you get some from grind too. Now heres how it works, you get credits, like exp, from participating in battles(grinding) roughly around 50k to 100k on a good game, and lets be real you wont be as good as youtubers of this game and be the carry to get a more than that, the problem again rises when you reach tiers 8,9,10 where the cost(yes there is a credits cost) to enter a battle with X ship is pretty much higher than the credits reward for winning/losing the battle, this becomes extremely obvious with tier 9 ships where even if you win, if you plaid poorly you are still in the negative... so... the tiers at which the game is most fun, the developers pretty much said no to that.Now what im getting at is premium account time MARGINALLY fixes this, you get more EXP per battle so theres less grind, and more money and lower deployment cost(participating in game) this basically makes it like this, people say its efficient for non premiums to farm with tier 5-6 for money to buy and play tier 9-10 ships, and this is an insane grind ( i forgot to mention credit costs to buy ships go from 5 million at lower tiers to over 10 million credits for tier 9 or 10 )  so instead, with premium account time, you can farm money with tier 6-7 without losing money if you dont win the game.Theres EXP conversion cost which means you convert EXP accumulated with a ship ( the one you grind with duh ) to something called Free EXP that can instead be used to unlock ( and then buy if you got the credits ) any ship, this costs real money currency and the same system is in place for commanders and resetting commander skills (im not going to get into this) both of which have a decent cost, but the cost being decent is a direct result of how insane the grind has to be in the first place, which is not a good thing. On top of which you dont outright buy Free exp, commander EXP.. etc, you first grind it and pay to convert it to, hopefully, be used on buying t9 and 10 only.All in all a very great core game with rotten wargaming elements, i do recommend it because its extremely satisfying to play, the explosion sounds which they keep improving, that time you get citadel hits(massive dmg) all is very fun to play and everyone should give it a try.",Sun Nov 03 02:15:03 EET 2019,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

45bdebca-6a00-43db-907e-a54fb06a45a0,9,"Having played a little more than 1000 fights on the main account, I could not miss the output of this game on the expanses of my favorite Steam.Wargamng, as a developer company, came to the gaming industry from the 90s of the last century and this left a strong imprint on the thinking of top managers and the designer's decisions taken under their pressure.In particular, WOWs is developed by third-party Lesta, but tries in all to copy the tanks WG, and maybe not worth doing it.We have the same 10 levels of technology, with most of the ships in the branch practically repeating each other, not only by contours, but also by weapon configurations. For example, all Japanese cruisers from level 5 have a 203 mm caliber of guns, all Americans are 150 mm, and so on.It is clear that it is very difficult to think up differences of similar ships in general, so that the user has a feeling that they are all different, but why then as many as 10 levels.In addition to not understanding why a ship similar in general costs twice as much as it is at a higher level, the balancer throws all the players with a difference of 2 levels of technology in one battle.Those. 5 lvl plays with 7 lvl, 7lvl with 9lvl and so on. Beginners suffer and are angry with the developers. To all other things, the modules of the purchased ship are initially rather weak, and when buying tops the ship, as a rule, is transformed. Gets penalties for perks and a transplanted captain.As a result, the player swims with a slow recharge, turn of the steering wheel and other joys of life and the development of developers in vain.Why this was doing and injuring the players, it is unclear. Maybe the developers themselves were traumatized in their childhood and they harbored resentment?It was possible to make 3 levels - beginners, everything that floated before the 2nd world, middle class - the most massive second world and paper projects like high-level content for clans, etc.As a result, new players enter the game and set themselves a goal to pump the conditional Yamato, for which it is necessary to collect more than 1,000,000 experience points. At the same time, there are both playable ships in the branch, as well as frank cacti, which the developer is rumored to introduce, so that players pass them for free experience through donate.Rushing up to Yamato, it becomes obvious that it was just a trap of developers, because the game on it, as on any top ten gives a stable minus even with a premium account. As a result, in order to ride on the top you need to farm silver on the ships, and this is a separate topic.Regarding the prema, I still do not get tired of being surprised by the logic of the WG. You make a technique that, according to the logic of your game, users will have to play the lion's share of time, to accumulate money and experience on it and to pump the captain.Why, then, does the technician necessarily have a flaw that makes it uncomfortable with respect to conventional ships.Why am I buying a tank or a ship for $ 50 I do not get a sense of advantage, and even vice versa.Separately, I want to say that the premium strategy is also used by the VG to replenish online at certain levels of the game with intent. In brief I will say that in the game 2 comfortable levels of technology - 4LVL and 7Lvl.4 level is comfortable, because by the mechanics of the game it throws a maximum against 5, so you will not have much superiority over you. Especially since level 5 throws on the feed to 7, so on the four you will often play in the top or among the brethren.7 level is comfortable because although it throws to the nines, but there are not enough of them in the rand, since it is economically unprofitable to play them. Therefore, he often plays against 8 prizes or even in the top.It would seem that in this scenario, it is enough to buy 4 or 7 Prem and calmly farm on it with a high percentage of victories. And now we open a premium store and what we see. At 4 corpses only 1 premier battleship Ichizuchi - absolutely unplayable ship, which is worse than classmates in everything. Battleship without armor, which also removed the range.At level 7 there are 3 destroyers, two cruisers and a German battleship. There are 2 more aircraft carriers, on which the gameplay is very specific. Battleship is not bad, if you do not take into account its 283 mm guns. The destroyers are generally good, but it is understandable that Main players will not choose them. Cruisers I generally believe in this game is garbage.The main vehicles are located at the least comfortable 6 and 8 levels. Playing at 6 you will constantly fall against 8 levels and feel complete impotence. Playing 8 will use you to feed damage to 10 lvls. That is, when buying 8 premi it is necessary not to rejoice, but to grieve, since you will not see any comfortable game on it for a long time.After all the nagging above there is a logical question, why do I recommend this game, whether it is worth it to play at all.The fact is that in my games I first of all are interested in the process of cognition, understanding of game mechanics, choosing the most effective options for gaining an advantage over the enemy. And WOWs all this generously provides.The key parameter is the percentage of wins, it shows how many fights your team has won.And although it may seem that the victory of a team of 12 people does not depend on the efforts of one person, but this is not so.The fact is that playing well and influencing the battle can significantly increase the chance of winning your team and have the status 60+ in a solo game.Here is the implementation of this task and keeps me in the game, makes it interesting for me.How to achieve this task?First of all, one must understand that the current level system is broken and not all classes of ships in this game are equally good. In other words, 95% of the ships are frank garbage.Of those that are even good, many are not suitable for the game because of the uncomfortable level of fighting, for example, 5.6.8 levels are not suitable due to the +2 level of combat. 10 are not suitable because of the negative economy. There are 4, 7 and the ninth levels.On the 4th level, Izyaslav and Isokadze are good ships.In the seventh, almost everything, depending on the style of the game.On the ninth I did not play, but I can highlight Missouri as a prem with good stats, to which one should strive to accumulate free experience in an amount of sky-high 7500000.Regarding the role in battle - the destroyers affect the fight very much, as the meaning of this game is in capturing points and gaining advantages over points.The success of the game depends on whether you can live to the end of the battle, while doing considerable damage and not getting it in response, grabbing the points and not letting the enemy do it.It is of course important to kill, but since the size of the cards is large, you can kill a lot and still lose on points.As a match, I really like the game, it allows you to think, make informed decisions during the battle and enjoy the result.

Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Sun Dec 12 02:48:17 EET 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

Detail and historical accuracy is very detailed.  if you dont want to play with real live opponets you can play against bots. there are several campains and senarios or random or co-op play, play your favorite nation, mount paint on your ships, mount flags on them, level up your comanders but you get to pick how he is trained. again, play the game about 100 times to level up your comander to the next level or spend $5-10 and level up instantly.The game offer's many optons for modifing ships, but leveling up to the next level becomes harder and takes longer with each new tier level.  detail in the graphics is just great and you have many game options for detail qualitiesThe developer has both hands and feet in this game, and they usually give daily notices or education material, they ask us questions to improve the game, tayloring it to what we would like to see and want.Kassera",Thu Nov 26 07:47:50 EET 2020,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

It has a relatively long time to kill unless you're an idiot and serve up the broadside of your ship to a wall of torpedos, or a Yamato. It's all about paying attention to everything that's going on and always thinking four or five steps ahead, because it takes that long for a ship to get anywhere or do anything.Pretty annoyed Wargaming didn't support linking to existing accounts with the steam version (I confirmed by contacting support), but see the video on youtube about it by Ichase for a workaround.

It's good that more get to enjoy that content, but paying players didn't get a single worth-while thing as compensation. I gave the game a long break but came back to see how the content offering was recently. They lock all story content behind several different paywalls, ensuring you pay the price of a whole game several times over in a relatively short time period if you want to experience the ongoing story.\n\nI paid money for expansions only to see the content I should own access to removed from the game with not so much as a \""sorry\"", and get told to buy multiple different season passes if I want to catch up with the story again. I get that the tech this game is built on ain't exactly the most easy to work with, and the term \""technical debt\"" doesn't begin to describe the extent of its issues, but if you need to remove content then I expect at least something in return for my now wasted money, and going on afterwards to separate new content behind several different paywalls rather than at least giving out something substantial for players is astoundingly disrespectful. This is pathetic and the sort of thing I'd expect from Activision. Bungie was supposed to be better after leaving them. Getting their freedom back was supposed to let them avoid the predatory business tactics but I guess all Activision left of this company was a husk. Fans of the game should be treated far better than this, yet the game just exploits them for cash and it's fucking disgusting.""",Sat Jan 23 05:33:37 EET 2021,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

The dev's seem to have made very little effort to compress the game size. War Thunder is literally half the size of this game, and it has hundreds of unique aircraft tanks and maps, and all vehicles handle differently, some have modeled interiors and their armor and piercing is simulated. I don't understand why this game takes up so much space. There are quiet a few ships but nowhere near the amount of other games. No campaign or large amounts of dialogue.

It doesn't take long to get to tier 3 or 4 and from there forward the game doesn't change much.  Pretty much every premium item is overpriced though, so if you want to support the game's development prepare to dish out some serious dough.The fix for people who already have an account and want to play it through steam is really easy.

There are some bad reviews regarding that you can't play your old account on steam and what they don't know is that all you have to do is change the Steam file ""Steam_api"" by adding a ""2"" infront of file's name to play with your old account and there some youtube videos in where you can find it and change it.There are four classes of ship Battleships (BB), Carriers (CV), Destroyers (DD), and Cruisers (CL/CA) and there is Premium ships for all four classes of ship. Also if you want to get premium ships they do rotate premium ships by Tech tree refreshers in January and September every year otherwise the other way to obtain them is by limited time sales. Ships like the Arkansas can't be purchased, and OP ships like the Konig Albert and the Nikolai can't be purchased at all.For Carriers I Recommend playing Tier 4-5 carriers first in PvP/PvE and and practicing strafes with fighters and Alt attacks with Strike aircraft in Tier 6 with PvE first before being commited to carriers in PvP. There are youtube videos to help you be a better CV player in the game.When you are in Destroyers and Cruisers and have torpedoes (this also includes battleships with torpedoes) look at your torpedo range first before going into battle and also be careful launching your torpedoes when allies are near as if your not careful by these two things you'll be accidently teamkilling your own team and you'll turn pink at one point playing these ships.Battleships are a classes that relies on their main guns doing all the work and have the armor to soak up damage. AP by fare does more damage than HE, but HE does create more fires. Use AP for broadsides and when the enemy BB is angled bow on towards you use HE unless you are in a Yamato. Not every Battleship has the same armor, take the tier 5 American battleship New York for example, it uses the all or nothing armor concept, to do heavy damage towards all or nothing Battleships in a Battleship hit the area of the aft and stern and between the aft/Stern and citadel to do maxium damage there. When fighting ships like the Bismarck that has the Turtleback armor scheme, it's more difficult getting citadeled at close range but in return it's vulernable to plunding fire. One trick in fighting ships like the bismarck in a battleship is instead of aiming at the waterline aim a little higher towards the upper belt you'll do a more damage there. If in a Cruisers or Destroyer use HE unless you have torpedoes to use against the BB. I don't want to make my review too long, this game is great but it does have it's flaws but I do recommend it.",Wed Mar 18 12:31:43 EET 2020,62a6899b-550d-45d7-b4cd-3329be85e915

I can not speak for the launch of this game, but in its current state I consider it a genuine masterpiece. \n\nThe main gripes I even have with it are more like nitpicks. I wish that the visuals had a much more diverse color spectrum. And also not to I can't launch the game properly anymore, meaning I can't play it. I've looked up fixes but to no avail. For now it remains uninstalled on my hard drive. :[\n\nThe gunplay is incredible with so much to learn from each gun, attatchments could use a bit more variations, like adding stocks would've been nice. The maps can be frustrating at times but others are genuinely cinematic experiences that make you feel like you're in a movie. The gritty and realistic atmosphere Battlefield 4 creates puts you into the action and conflict to create moments like no other game. \n\nI can't recall another game where I was able to ride a snowmobile, fire a rocket into a hover tank and completely destroy 7 enemies camping a point with only 2 people. \n\nIf there was ever a desert island game for me, it'd be this.""",Mon Dec 14 18:18:08 EET 2020,fb19e8b3-173a-4bcf-843b-ccf44bf748e2

8fffff29-4b2e-4ab2-8600-bbf8eec91cff,3,"After playing through to tier 3 (or 4?) I bought a tier 7 premium ship. The difference between tiers isn't that much of a quality step. More important is that the tier system is separating the beginners from the more deeply involved (play-time) players, which is a good thing. There are sometimes people not playing 'by the book' and we loose. Sometimes that person is me, othertimes not. It's much about learning to play each class of ship, which have their own role and characteristics. Having someone equally advanced as you by your side is more fun than playing against much easier or much harder opponents.The challenges in this game is, however, not the gear, but the strategy (overall plan) and the tactics (battles). There is an invisible range from enemy ships you should try not to cross too far alone, if so, you will sink before you know it, especially if several ships target you.  Observe the range where others may detect you and the range of your main artillery. Also, keep an eye at the map now and then, to avoid being trapped alone against many.This is a not so social game. After playing almost 200 games, very few has reached out to me with messages. There is occasionally humorous messages, but rarely swearing.Nevertheless, the music is wonderful and the effects awesome. The developers have done a masterpiece! This game give great moments. A session might last 10-20 minutes, which is perfectly fine to be in touch with reality now and then. ",Sun Jun 14 11:53:51 EEST 2020,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb
e090f8cd-f141-4dac-ba76-ce9232fd622a,6,"""You know a game is good when it has a skip cutscene option and you don't want to use it.\nYou know a game is good when you are sad that they skip the boring part of traveling to a mission objective.\nYou know a game is good when the story makes you almost stop playing because what's the point.\n\nIt's hard to write in a review what makes this game so special as you need to experience it. What I can write is why I think it's a masterpiece while not spoiling it.\n\nIf you want an open world experience where the world feels alive, NPC live their lives and where stories unfold with or without your active involvement this is the game for you. Just riding around between missions you will get so many random events, some of them even forming little stories that even after 100 hours I was still finding new things. Save a man from his own bear trap? Meet the same fellow in a nearby town few days later and he gives you a reward. Pickup a stranded girl and bring her home, get some information that helps you later. This type of event's make it feel like individuals have their own life and good or bad luck. \n\nActivities that you can do are plentiful and integrate very well into the game. Even collectable mission are something you do for extra cash and you can do them in increments. This makes it so natural during gameplay and it's not something you go out to do just to achieve 100%. Finding cards and bones just happens while exploring, hunting or fishing. Not to mention that there are so many interiors, shacks, houses, whole farms that you can explore, steal and murder your way through them. \n\nAll of this makes the world of RDR2 one of the best open worlds out there. Ubisoft should take a note here. This is how you make a open world work. Every mechanic stands alone but also is seemingly integrated with the general feel of the game.\n\nStory is I would say Rockstar going to their original quality. Memorable main and side characters. Through story, side mission and activities you get to know them and they become part of the experience. This leads to questioning any available decision that the game throws at you whit great caution. I feel that they took a different path than in GTA 5 where side characters kinda felt like a mean to an end while here they are your friends and you actually care for them. Your character Arthur has a very unique progression. Without spoiling anything he is a man that tries to live in the ever changing world  going through industrialization. He is learning to cope that the old days are gone and trying to find a purpose in this new era. Even if you don't do any side activities just playing through the story is a worthwhile experience.\n\nThe downsides are very few. There is some jittering of animations in towns that happens at random. I also experiences a bug when toggle to aim was on so I had to play with hold to aim option and one quest was bugged from progressing due to a known bug.\nBesides bugs I would love to see the eating and drinking mechanics serve a more survival purpose. I loved going up to the mountain rationing and hunting for food.\n\nAll in all this game pulled me in and didn't let me go until I finished it. It's a unique experience that I would recommend to everyone. Only regret is that I didn't start playing it sooner!""",Sun Nov 22 14:15:45 EET 2020,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

It's at its core a endless deathmatch game with some PVP thrown in. Nothing that much different from WOT or any other similar game. But the mechanics are good, and the balance is great. You never feel underpowered even on tier 1. You can always outsmart and outthink when outgunned. Something that WOT will never be able to do. Nor War Thunder. But still... endless death matches. That can only last so much.- Competent on sound, graphics and what not, but it's mainly a dead game if want to PVP. Most of the times it's you against one other guy with a team filled with bots. The bots put up a good challenge, but it gets boring real quickly though. TL:DR It's free. You ain't losing a thing by trying. Just don't get lured by the Siren's song and start to drop cash on this.

This game's monetization is out of hand.\n-the game's monetization is very bad, with the dlcs it will cost about 200$ to keep up with the current grind, not to mention the season passes you have to buy to gain certain activities, not to mention the other deluxe editions and silver. and also the game is free-to-play so it can put up microtransactions to buy with destiny 2 silver that can't be received without buying it.\n2. The lack of long-term content.\n-the long-term content (which is what i call it) is boring/enraging/repetitive, any order and combination counts. the PVP is made to attract players to play the game more, but its currently the biggest cancer since its a bit of a no-brain fuck fest. with the amount of broken weapons being abused and amount of sweatlords that ruin your chances of getting loot in trials and ruining your enjoyment and you have a very cancerous tumor in the game, gambit is fine with teammates you can coordinate in, but that is irregular and not worth a lot for playing full time. and alot of good content to play, is behind a pay wall.\n3. The game's lack of story\nthis one is not as big of a problem than the others, but the lack of a story for new-comers (or a pile of confused mess) is a bit off-putting hence not giving them interest in the game in the immediate moment.\n\nwith the game's glaring flaws it does have good things.\none is that this game is a gold mine for people who are really interested in special, unique weapons and lore-hunting, to worlds-first raids and community events, this game is made for people heavily interested in this game (myself included), the game has certain fun missions for the people who grind hard or play \""for fun\"", and even a volley of new things on the way for dedicated players to enjoy, like witch queen and its new crafting system. overall this game is a mixed back, because its target audience is very specific, thus not having a lot of people interested in it, but those who are, are awesome and one of the most dedicated and most fun people I could ever find ever (ex. CBGray, Sweatcicle and some other lfg raiders) and it's  a very fun community to join (except those apes in crucible) but the flaws are still there and should be noticed and fixed or changed in some form. \n\ni give it a 7/10\nits great but some things need to be fixed, and they need to give us more than just a few updates to beyond light and a giant pay-wall\n\ntl;dr\nthis game is too expensive, but its fun and addictive""",Wed Jan 12 03:07:48 EET 2022,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

You know before many conflicts whether you have engaged on superior footing or lesser than your opponent(s). This is because the pace of entering most conflicts(for the observant, and discarding careless play) is very casual and the pace of the combat itself is relaxed. When you are winning or loosing a conflict, you are already reflecting on earlier parts of the conflict - positioning, speed of entry, bearing of your guns, state of your torpedos or repair kits or smoke bombs, the decisions you made to enter the conflict at all based on your vehicle, nearby allies' vehicles, proximity to allies and the enemies, and the types of vehicles the enemies are in. It's a learning experience to loose, and like writing out a trig proof to win. The proofs available are different by every feature of an encounter. You grow your knowledge of the proofs by loosing a specific setup, and thinking about what variables could've been changed to make it either avoidable, escapable, or beatable. You also think about the other side of it - how you could embrace a certain set of variables for an assault, and how you could do it better or support it if an ally attempts it.",Tue Jul 27 06:47:20 EEST 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

The sole purpose of those free games is to make you spend money and don't even provide you with a complete product, I could go on but I won't.This is most definitely a game, a great game a fun game and a game that I would most definitely recommend to friends and family.",Sun Aug 01 11:20:22 EEST 2021,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

dff4fb86-05a5-4b91-bfa4-a0e6931cd4f4,10,"""A cowboy game that really lets you horse around, pun intended. Unless it's the story missions. \n\nTL;DR: It's really good, but the gameplay is at odds with the story, which could have probably been shorter. \nIf you like wild west media in general or open world games, it's definitely worth a try even if you are just going to mess around and not finish a story(only 20.3% of people did on Steam actually). \n\nVisually, it's (mostly) beautiful, especially considering how huge the open world is, with some worse textures here and there. A lot of care went into animations, the cutscene animations are especially worth mentioning, and many little details that make the world seem more lived in. Apparently horse balls shrink in the cold, but as I am not weird, I haven't actually checked.  Though admittedly, being an 2018 game, it's showing some age. \nIt's also worth mentioning that game uses checkerboard-rendering, which causes visible artifacts in hair and fur. The only solutions are to either use TAA(which makes everything blurry and makes it look worse) or much higher rendering resolution. The DLSS isn't that amazing in this game and makes the hair artifacts worse.\nSound-wise, I have nothing wrong to say about this, everything is essentially perfectly spot on.\n\nThe gameplay by itself is good, though dated with some more immersive elements like looting animations or skinning or animal as well as some survival mechanics such as eating. The survival mechanics are pretty shallow and really more for some immersion like I said or minor roleplaying.\nWhat also helps roleplaying is really wide array of customization options - hair, beard(both growing in real time) or clothes. And boy, there is a huge variety of clothes to choose from as well, so you can play the cowboy dress-up game too if you want to.\nThe world is beautiful, with a lot to hunt and explore. It has quite a few side story missions that are usually pretty funny and nice diversion from the main plot. \n\nThe story is about a gang of more noble outlaws during the ending years of the Wild West, as the country was becoming more and more civilised. The fact that you can't fight the progress and change is a large thematic part of the game, whether it's the the law trying to end the outlaw life, or the gang itself being against old values such as slavery.\nIt's well written for the most of it, but sometimes characters killing 40-50 people during as story missions feels really off for the kind of story it's trying to tell. Other times there are some AWFUL story conveniences that are just straight up irritating with villains escaping in awkward manner. \nThough that did sound more negative than positive, the story is definitely worth experiencing, though could probably be bit shorter to be paced better.\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer component, as I heard it's pretty grindy and I already have an actual job, so yeah.\nIf you can buy it on sale, which is lately usually 50% off, it's a really good deal. I don't think I'd want to pay 60 for it.""",Sun Sep 20 00:18:49 EEST 2020,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

A crazy global conspiracy that's slowly unveiled in a futuristic world of augmentations and crazy tech? FEMA camps are real! Creepy AI! Global geo-engineering projects! Globe-trotting travel! Nope, sorry, none of that here. Enjoy investigating a subway station bombing in Prague for 40 hours. That's literally it.

Spoiler Alert: one bad guy would like to get some legislation passed because it might make the other bad guy's business fail. Seriously? Sorry am I playing Deus Ex or have I accidentally started watching a procedural legal drama? Here and there the writers sort of half-heartedly try to cram in some conspiracy theory illuminati spookyness, but it falls flat and is immediately forgotten.\n\nOther gripes: Hope you like spending 4 hours save-scumming so you can crawl 50 feet without being spotted by guards- that's the entire game now- tedious unrewarding stealth. What else... They made the hacking mini-game somehow even more obnoxious. The pistol is terrible now and silenced lethal weapons are kind of bad in general, so you either have to play sneaky melee or guns-blazing, there's no in between. Inventory management is as dumb as ever and should just be scrapped.

7f1739c9-1007-4a2b-8895-c349eec6ddf8,7,"think this game is great, and am suprised to see the reviews are fairly mixed. The game runs smoothly on my pc wich is a fairly old and cheap one, looks good, sounds good, plays good and doesnt have many bugs. The gameplay reminds a bit of a moba, but then again, not quite. Also reminds a bit of chess, in real time, where every piece is controlled by one person, but then again, not quite.A standard battle has a 12v12 setup and when you die, you're gone. You either win by killing the other team, or you win by points - you get points from capture points and from kills, and loose points when team mates die. Every match has a limit of 20 minutes but often ends earlier. To be good at the game you mainly need situational awareness, and the ability to plan ahead, as well as accurately see what you opponents will do. It's also a fairly causual experience, there is 7v7 clan battle seasons, but the majority of your games will be ""random battles"" that just throw 12 people up against 12 other people with same classess and tiers of ships. You can group up with friends for these battles, but you are limited to groups of 3 people in each.You certainly can open up your wallet for this game, and you can be a whale too, but i dont think you need too. There are 10 tiers of ships and many ship trees that are all free. You first start with a very basic tier 1, get some experience with that then you get you buy (with in game currencies) the next tier ship in that line and so on. Every new tier introduces more game mechanics so the game gets harder the more you play, as higher tier ships only duke it out with other high tier ships. In the first tiers its +-1 tier, but when you reach tier 5 its +-2 tiers, meaning tiers 5s can be matched up against tier 7s. I see alot of reviews say this is a bad thing, but i dont really think so. Remember, every team has the exact same number of ships with the exact same classess and tiers. If you are a tier 5 destroyer there will be a tier 5 destroyer on the other team also. And a tier 5 ship can defiently outplay any tier 7 ship, you are just in a slightly worse ship. But I do think many players hit a wall at around tier 5 as alot of better players enjoy the mid tiers, and the lower tiers are full of noobs. That combined with more punishing game mechanics the higher you get up the trees could make your first tier 5 a rough experience. If you wanna progress quicker in the trees there is premium account time for sale, which could cost you 10 euros for a month, or less the more time you buy at once. (I just bought 12 months for 40 euros, but that was during a sale). There are also ships outside of the skill trees that are called premium ships, that you can only get from buying them directly. They have their benefits but are overall as good as the free ships, with a couple of exceptions (some premiums are hitting around 55% win rate on average). Over all I would not recommend buying any premiums when you start out, especially high tier ones. If you hop in a high tier ship as a noobie you get paired with others in high tier ships that knows the game and you will get absolutely smashed. So yeah, over all great game. Probably a bit different to what you are used to. It's mostly a mind game, your super quick counter strike reflexes and pin point accuracy wont really help you here.

[i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact.

It's a decent game to play around with, though highly annoying even for the full time streamers i see play the game. Biggest con in the game I would say is just how LUCK based it is. Now they will go on and on about their aiming system. But in reality it seems to be extremely luck based. I'll explain a bit. Most of the games i have played i seem to HALO about 90% of the time, while the other team seems to hit me with at least 5 shots of a 6 round burst at least 75% of the time. So the aiming works by creating an oval, the shots all land somewhere in the oval depending on LUCK. Now if you lock onto someone it is supposed to shrink this oval and if you're closer it also shrinks it. Funny thing is it never seems to matter. I have had shipps completely broad side to me and i hit on every ♥♥♥♥ing side but not 1 shot lands on the damn ship. I have had them nose at me and same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Of course shooting a ship coming straight at you should be harder, but when the enemy is attacking me like i said they seem to have about 75% accuracy regardless of the direction im going. Hell even when im playing a destroy class and continuously rotating around theyre hitting with most their shots.Now either 90% of the players are cheating and the creaters aren't doing a damn thing about it. Or their firing system is mostly luck based. However, if you can deal with that bs then you should be fine. I see many big streamers playing this game and they get irritated at how much they halo compaired to other ships too so I know it's not just me. It also seems to have severally increased how good AA is to the point that 1 bombing run of torps or bombers literally killed every one of the jets... And since carriers barely carry any ships (at least to teir 5) it's extremely pointless to even play as a carrier anymore. This can be noticed by how many games I play that are completely without carriers, and how when you are queing up the carrier que is typically at a 0... Kinda sad that you made a class completely pointless, when in real life carriers pretty much own everything. However, even with my negatives the overall fun I have had with this game out weighs the extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ portion to it. I keep playing, though if they fixed the game I would probably put a lot more time into this one over other games.",Sun Mar 14 21:42:47 EET 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

bd87117d-2d6e-472f-bd4b-b7c17abf271e,9,"This game is a straight up RNG engine. You need to have some skill to participate in that engine, i.e. if you're not good you won't get the chance to get lucky or unlucky with shots at all and you'll simply miss, but even when you figure out ranging, leading, etc. you'll often find two shots from the same cannon drifting above AND below the target at the SAME TIME! Entire broadsides fired together will somehow fall inches from the target on every side without touching it. And sometimes every shot will hit. Totally up to the drift RNG. But even better, particular locations on the ship are critical hits (called the citadel) if you penetrate the armor. Taking the drift into account, you can aim for them, but outside close range it is, of course, relatively random whether you hit this spot or not. Whether you penetrate the armor or not is, you guessed it, more RNG. But what makes this REALLY great is on top of all that, if it DOES hit the citadel, and if it DOES penetrate the armor, the damage is utterly catastrophic, taking off up to 50% of your health per shell. Not a battleship shell to a destroyer. A battleship shell to a battleship. Same weight class. 50%. Gone. Just like that. Completely. At. Random.But what's even MORE fun? On top of all that, there is a tiny, tiny percentage chance that any given shot will hit your magazine. So more RNG for more massive damage.The practical upshot of all this is while there is a significant amount of skill involved, and the chances of it happening to you at any given time are low, you can (and do) intermittently just explode for no reason. You can be winning a duel by a LOT and then a lucky, single shell, fired as a parting shot from a fleeing foe with a broken rudder and a burning deck, will completely obliterate you.So to be completely fair, that doesn't happen much. But it does happen, and when it does it's pretty much the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ever. Basic citadel hits, which are far more common, are still pretty obnoxious, as there's little you can do about them.So basically, skill is involved, but not really the ultimate deciding factor. If you enjoy randomly exploding, play this game. If you don't... Well, if you're really into ships then give it a try for the good looking models and see for yourself. But if you're not into ships, just give it a pass. It's not a good enough game to reccomend to anybody who isn't a Pacific Theatre nerd.

bd87117d-2d6e-472f-bd4b-b7c17abf271e,5,"I like it so far but there do seem to be serious issues. First I couldn't play it through steam. When i downloaded it through steam it kept saying your game does not match the server version. I had to download the war games launcher from the game website, then link the launcher game folder to the steam game folder and splice the files. It took me a few days to figure that out. If i launch it through steam It brings me to a different profile not the wargames one. So that is why i only have .7 hours, although I do only have about 5 or 6 anyway. So far I would say it is fun, but my highest ship is tier 3, I'm like a thousand exp away from 4. I was pushing my way to a carrier but after seeing other reviews i am rethinking that decision. So far this is way less frustrating than world of tanks and warthunder. A lot less dying and it at least seems that the matches are mostly balanced. I hated when in world of tanks you would roll out then immediately get one shot by a premium tank three tiers higher than you with a bunch of premium buffs. I am sure I am going to hit a pay wall quite soon, but the game does seem nice enough where I am actually considering buying something. Probably when i hit the inevitable pay wall round tier 6. Over all I'd say give it a try. Just hide your wallet for a while because the options to buy are shoved in your fave and are quite tempting. It is quite fun in lower tiers so just play it till it pisses you off then uninstall, worked for world of tanks and all the games like this.",Sat Jan 01 19:49:19 EET 2022,62a6899b-550d-45d7-b4cd-3329be85e915

So thus leading you to play mostly in that lovley Co Op area until you can get a friend to play with or find one in game...but then again it's a free to play game so you'll find mostly children or the mental equivilent of a child when you need to have at least some tactical awareness in this VERY SLOW PACED game that heats up VERY QUICKLY only to end sometimes too fast or not fast enough...rarely do I ever find a truly Fun round.I can also just see the responses from those who defend this game religiously because they paid money for a ship and got ripped off thus they feel obligated to defend their 'investment' hahahahahahahIf anyone wants a quick idea of how much Real World money they want for a ship, the USS Arizona (BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST WELL REKNOWN SHIPS ON THE PLANET EARTH) is a tier 6 (maybe 7 I can't recall right now) and is a superior version to the it's counterpart that you can earn in game without needing real money. I first looked in to the price of it expecting maybe a $20 price tag perhaps pushing $30....OH NO! First you have to buy the in game currency which is only sold in certain bundles of ammounts and then you can spend that currency on the ship, also you don't get ANY REFUNDS once you buy this in game currency even if you don't use it. Well to wrap it up they wanted me to buy either a $60 bundle to have enough of the in game currency to just buy the USS Arizona however it would leave me with some extra that I have no use or desire for at all, I don't even want a spare crate or an extra ship slot at all just the ship....but no I have to over spend just to get what I want. Or I can spend around $45 on a few seperate bundles to get...yet again...just a few extra in game currency bits that I DON'T WANT. It's very kind of them to try and help you spend your money for you!Oh yeah don't forget that ALL of the purchaseable ships (Real World Money that is) are given so many extra buffs that a standard free to play player CAN NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO that don't only give some aid to the player who bought the ship as way of thanking them for the purchase (which I can understand) but they also give them in game advantages against you and your abilites making you a less lethal opponent...and they spent money to get that buff...I believe that's called PAY TO WIN. What a lame game this crap still is....it'll be dead in probably 1 year...2 if it's lucky hahahahahahh",Thu Dec 30 15:07:55 EET 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

Figured I would have some fun playing around with ships again. :DThen I found out that you can't login with your wargaming.net account with this Steam version. It tries to make an all new account. There is no way I'm resetting my progress and being forced to use a new account just because Wargaming.net can't get its s*** together. Instantly I was reminded how annoyed I used to be at Wargaming.net that caused me to stop playing their games in the first place.

Ships from 20 years apart are forced to fight each other with enormous imbalances and a tier 5 will face tier 7s every other match.High tier gameplay is mostly boring campfests at long range because moving close gets someone instantly focused on the wide open maps.Aircraft carriers are both boring to play (like the world's worst RTS game) but also game-breakingly overpowered, with infinite fuel planes that launch 30 in 10 seconds (unlike a real carrier where it would take hours to get every single plane out of the hangar, moved up on deck and launched one at a time.) Because of the joke matchmaking, an aircraft carrier can fight a 1910 ship that does 0 DPS to airplanes because it got time-traveled by the terrible russian developer. Airplanes can drop torpedoes from solid cliff faces or 1 inch of water and there are no water-tight compartments on ships in-game, so a ship that could float without the nose and without the rear in real life will auto-die to 1 tiny section flooding with water after extinguishing a fire. Carriers average the damage of 3-4 combat ships but can stay hidden in spawn behind a cliff all game long with no risk.It's okay to play free, but do not expect the company to improve the game.

I was recommended the game by a friend and it was on sale at the time and decided to buy it and give it a try. I was greeted by some very amazing graphics i havent seen in a game before. It was so realistic that i got so immersed and when i woke up a day after playing i expected to wake up at a camp (not joking). I even took a small break and went for my daily jog and thought a horse was following behind me. So if you're wondering about the graphics, yes, they're very great. As for the gameplay? It was some of the best i ever played in my life. The dead eye mechanic was a great thing to use if you ever got cornered by a bunch of enemies, which happened to me a lot. The horse mechanics are some of the best ones i've ever seen and used in a video game. Its like riding an actual horse. The calm mechanic and caring for the horse is very accurate. The NPC's will even comment on your horses care and if its a good horse or a terrible one based on the stats. Truly an amazing way to implement horses into a game. The gameplay is just so damn good i cant get over it. I absolutely love it. This game made me addicted to it in the most amazing way possible, and i love it. Its also for the very first time since skyrim, destroyed my sleep schedule. I am now going to talk about the story of the game, so if you dont want to be spoiled and you yourself are a new buyer then i recommend not reading further, so i will say here that the game is a 100000000000/10. go play it. Now without further a due... The Story. The story of the game was really, really beautiful. I didnt play red dead 1 so i dont know how the gang met up or their backstory. But when getting faced with such an amazing story like this? i honestly didnt care. It was just so fluent and clear to me. as if i already knew the characters backstories. I didnt know at the time but the ending depends on your honor meter being low or high. And i of course, had my honor meter low because almost every person i ran into i tried robbing. I even found some old crazy guy and put him out of his misery thinking it was the ok thing to do. But anyways onto the major parts of the main story. Over all the story was very amazing and some parts were pretty sad. The death of Sean really hit home for me because i loved his character. He seemed like an annoying little brother that everyone acts like they hate but actually loves. His death really hit home for me. I felt like an actual person had died right in front of me. I didnt get the high honor arthur scene for him. I dont know it and wont search it because im gonna play through the game again and do everything right. As for Keirans death? It honestly didnt effect me that much. He really wasnt in the story that much and i never really saw him aside from bill wanting to cut his balls off. Hosea and Lenny's death on the other hand hit like a locomotive. After hunting with Hosea, and getting drunk with lenny, they felt like actual friends to arthur and i couldnt believe it when they died. It was truly something to behold. Mid way through the story i found a white arabian horse in the mountains. I decided to break it and ride with it a bit. After finally studying it i found out that its stats were just the same as the black arabian that i had been using. And since i had bonded with the black one more i decided to sell it. I then later looked at a horse guide and apparently that was one of the best horses in the game. I laughed my ass off for a good 5 minutes. But now back to the story. When i ended up on Guarmara I thought \""my fucking horse is gone\"" and i wouldnt see it ever again. But Guarmara was amazing. i actually had fun on that island. Manning the cannon was very cool and taking down that ship was really awesome. I remember when that one shit stain who enslaved the people of the island tried to bomb the escape ship and i immediately shot him in the head on sight. gg, ez, no re, cope, seethe, mald. But seeing Dutch go into this pit of madness was really an amazing development of his character. Slowly drifting away from what the character taught others and himself is a personal favorite of mine. But is unfortunate that I never got to see Dutch redeem himself. The ending i got was to say the least, heart breaking... When Arthur gave John his hat and said \""I dont have a use for this no more\"" I immediately broke into tears. I couldnt stop crying even while fighting that damn rat micah. I was then playing as John. So if anything i must say that this game is an absolute masterpiece to me. I havent played a game this good in 5 years. And so after all of that. And after 38 hours of gameplay within the span of a week of playing, i give this game a ∞/10. I truly love this game and that Rockstar games put everything they had into this game. Thank you, Arthur, for the amazing trip.""",Thu May 20 04:39:24 EEST 2021,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

This is a good game if you like casually blowing stuff up while intoxicated, or you really like boats, or you found World of Tanks too fast-paced. But if you're expecting a polished product? No. Interface is extremely clunky, game mechanics are completely non-competitive, and controls do not work as intended.Controls feel really clunky compared to Navy Field, Stellar Impact, and Hyperbol. Turrets cannot be grouped or toggled and the controls are unresponsive. No matter how hard you try to master the controls, the keyboard has been nerfed to be on-par with the console controller. This plays like the PC port of a console game.And why is the scatter so bad? I've played cardgames with less RNG (randomness). I'd heard that the random accuracy and nerfed torpedoes and nerfed aircraft were bad, but making accuracy nonexistent at close ranges?? Real life shells can't have that much spread or they wouldn't make it through the artillery's barrel! If you don't want your shots careening off at random 30° tangents then... Good luck.Queueing up an ammo switch reloads ALL guns after ONE gun fires a shot, instead of queueing each reload individually. Turret rotation fights against the player and EVERY turret turns so slowly that any turret out of line of sight is actively working to sabotage the player's damage output. The mouse cursor rotates all turrets at once, shift-X rotates all turrets at once, P does not disable turret rotation, and there is no way to select turrets or group your turrets. The only way to disable your turrets is by aiming outside their turn radius, or by frustratedly trying to fire while turning, because quickly turning your ship and turrets in opposite directions will prevent them from firing! (Even if you hold down the mouse for sequential fire.) Remember not to ammo swap, because it puts ALL turrets on cooldown!Allied bots will actively torpedo you, and the vast majority of your teammates in PvP will be bots, because matchmaking is newwwbie-friendly ;) and to be extra redundant, if you want to tryhard and play aircraft carrier then you're not allowed to manually control your aircraft (at tiers 4 & 5) because god-forbid having RESPONSIVE CONTROLS THAT LET YOU OUTPLAY YOUR OPPONENT!Locking turret rotation, normalizing the projectile spread at short range, and debugging sequential fire & reloading - these would make the game somewhat immersive.

I'll do it in Bullet form so it's Easier to find.COMBAT-Everyship has a Role to play. Carriers are there to Dominate the Air and Provide extra Means to sink/Spot Enemies. Battleships are the Tanks. Large HP and can deal massive amounts of Damage when your Main Battaries find their Mark. Cruisers provide Support Fire and help Defend the Larger Ships from Air Attacks. Destroyers are both Amazing and Annoying. Their Torpedoes can destroy a Ship in seconds, which both Benifits and Hurts you. If you see Torpedoes heading torwards you, either try to avoid them or pray they don't cause too much Damage. You have to Lead your Shots, failing to do so will result in a Wasted Shots. But combat seems Fair and has some Stratigy to it.So, now the Grind. Early on you'll notice that Ship's XP Requirement getls High, and I mean HIGH! Like a few days for one Ship kind of High. It wouldn't be so bad if they allowed Ship XP to be shared between Ships, basically negating Free XP (That can be shared but little is aquired). Also, you can't just start out with a Battleship, no you gotta work your way up, From Cruisers to Battleships, Battleships to Carriers. It is a bloosy Grind. My Suggestion? Go Player Versus Player, Yah you get some Coward Tactics but you get a lot more Bang for your Buck. Also, have 2-3 of the Same Ship. That way if you sink in Battle, you can still use another ship to get XP and since they are the same XP is stored on Each one for all use.Next... every Gamer's most HATED 2 Words... MICRO TRANSACTIONS!!!! Now, I hate EA with a Burning Passion.... but at least they don't charge you $60 for a f***ing Premium Ship! A Unique Tier 7 Battleship will cost around 12,000 Dubloons, which can cost you at least $60 just to buy a package. That is asinine. Add to the fact it NEVER is a High Tier 10 Ship, meaning it's the Best Ship for that Catagory/Nation. Since most ""Premium Ships"" are Tier 7-+, that means they aren't even the Strongest by Default. Yah, they maye have slightly different Stats, and have a ""Unique"" Paint Scheme, but NOT worth the $60",Sat Oct 09 10:55:21 EEST 2021,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

fa036961-0163-47e7-b22b-af965841bcc6,1,"This game is phenominal. Disregard any reviews that have less than 100 hours as they honestly haven't learned the game yet. It will take a lot of time to get the aiming in this game down, as every ships guns have different shell velocity or ""bullet speed"" and you will almost always have to lead your target. There is a lot of important information that the game doesn't tell you and this creates a learning curve that confuses and scares off a lot of people. You are almost certainly going to have to learn the mechanics via the wiki or online forums, but it is worth the time invested. There is a very long grind to get to a tier 10 ship (ships tiers range from 1-10 and the higher the tier the stronger the ship essentially) but it makes it that much more rewarding to get a t10. It took me around 100 hours to get my first t10 and it will take you more or less time depending on how quickly you learn the game and if your willing to shell out for premium.That brings us to the way the game is monetized. This game is free to play but has a subscription in the form of ""premium status"". All premium status does is give you a 50% boost to exp earned after each game as well as a credits earned boost. 50% is a huge boost yes, but you can most certainly play and progress without it. You also can get free premium status through events and the weekly operation. If you 5 star the weekly operation it will give you 24 hours of premium. So if you are free to play try and grind hard when you get that free day of premium every so often.There are also premium ships in this game that can be bought with real money. What most people don't mention though is that these are just slightly different versions of free-to-play ships that are better in some areas and worse in others. Also  premium ships only go up to tier 8. You can not directly buy any ship above tier 8 and you can't progress to higher tiers by playing them. This basically means that at the highest levels of play (tier 10) you arent going to see any premium ships. And if you do see them then they are at a huge disadvantage, as they are gonna be 2 tiers under you.I very much suggest atleast trying this game if you are interested. But do note, that you are gonna need a friend to help you along or you are gonna be in for some reading online.",Tue Aug 24 18:36:16 EEST 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

fa036961-0163-47e7-b22b-af965841bcc6,9,"""Artyom's story continues! Interestingly, Last Light is not a result of an adaptation - the story takes place in the same universe as its predecessor but it was not the sequel (titled Metro 2034) the Ukrainian developer team adapted. Rumor has it that the upcoming book Metro 2035 may be the adaptation of Last Light as the author of the books worked closely with the developer team. \n\nArtyom obtained fame after the ending of Metro 2033 - the game follows its \""bad\"" ending and Artyom is now a recognised ranger in D6. As supplies are running short the rangers are trying to come up with a plan to find more, in the meantime, the two opposing factions are getting more and more desperate in their attempt to overthrow one another. \n\nYou play Artyom again and everything you loved (or hated) in the prequel returns: anomalies, stealth-based approach in certain missions, an array of weapons that can use your \""currency\"" as stronger ammunition, Khan, nosalises, pneumatic gun, shotgun with suppressor etc. So what exactly has changed gameplay-wise? Well, you now have the option to take down enemies with a knife not just by throwing them. In fact, you can use its hilt to apply blunt force and silently take out your enemies. This actually counts toward achievements as the game rewards you for not killing people on certain levels. It was a nice addition to the game; something that I missed a lot in the first one. Oh, as for weapons: there do not come pre-modded but it is you who can purchased any mod you desire. Also, Artyom's filter and watch both seem to be operating much better and not being a nuisance.\n\nThe 4A Engine still looks good and to be honest I found this game more optimised than its predecessor. After Last Light I reinstalled Metro 2033 only to find it running much slower than its sequel. Not allowing you to fully customise the graphics from the options menu is still an issue but at least you can do some minor tampering instead of just picking a pre-determined set of settings.\n\nUnfortunately, Last Light could not be an exception to the growing world of DLCs. The game saw the release of 4 DLC packs not to mention that the Ranger mode itself is also a purchasable add-on. The Developer and Tower Pack DLCs are OK but what you definitely need to pick up are the Chronicles and Faction Pack with their missions and the former giving you some extra details on the game's plot.\n\nI liked Metro Last Light. I liked it a lot. I felt a much greater tension now in the world of Metro as Artyom is put in between two faction waging war against each other. The game was also a bit longer than its predecessor and the good-old Ranger difficulty mode returns for FPS veterans.""",Fri Nov 20 02:32:45 EET 2020,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

ce7dce78-96d4-432c-9e68-4e23432931ca,3,"Early Access ReviewI want to recommend this game, but I can’t. In its current state, it needs way too much work to be worth your time and money. I've been playing the game since the closed beta, and have well over 2500 battles since the closed beta reset. [EDIT] [I'm coming back to this review to address developer responses and update based on the current state of the game. I plan to do this every 3-6 months. An edit will appear in brackets. as of February 2018, many of my original points still stand, but I wanted to address the developer comments as well because the developers argue against my review.]Let’s start with the good:+Arcade battles allow for quick play, and make it constant action+The gameplay itself is rather fun, and the progression through the lines gives you a sense of accomplishment and goals+When a battle is well-balanced vertically and horizontally, the results make for a fun and engaging battle where while every team member counts, you can sway the battle in your favor by good play.        +[The developers, after learning the hard way multiple times, are starting to engage with the community in a positive manner, instead of constantly arguing every point (if you are confused, see the response below.]However, these positives are overshadowed by the glaring flaws in the game:-Poor client optimization: I have a rather good computer, and the game constantly hangs and eats up an inordinate amount of power for comparatively mediocre graphics [2/18 The developers can of course disagree, but that doesn't make them right. I have an extremely good processor and a top-of-the-line graphics card. This computer can run VR without flinching. This computer can run ARK at 50-60 fps at 4K and max graphics. This game runs WoWs competitor WarThunder without a hitch. Warframe runs extremely well at 4K (with its plethora of particle effects and much more going on screen) and looks beautiful. Meanwhile, this game constantly hitches and completely lags out while in a menu or when you try to switch out a component on your ship. While the actual gameplay doesn't lag too much, the menu is unbearable, and you feel as though I'm dragging the game to play it in the menus. Something needs to give, whether it is a full engine upgrade, or a simple optimization of code (maybe not having to do a server call every time one presses a button in port)]-Steam is for new users only (while this is a minor complaint, it’s a giant middle finger to those who’ve played since closed beta and gets me to my last point) [2/18 While the developers have voiced their opinion and are not going to revisit it, it still is a flaw in the game. And yes, adding features and flags that are only for new players through steam that older, dedicated players cannot get is insulting to those players, and shows the value the developers place on older players.]-Ridiculous Price model puts “premium ships” around $25-$30 USD for a handful of pixels (and that is on the lower end) [2/18 Once again, though the developers ""have stated it many times before"", newer players should know that the premium ships are generally expensive. If the developers do not want to lower the price, that is their perrogative, but it might be a barrier to entry]-Premium accounts are about the only way to make your investment back at the highest tiers unless you have consistently great games (which you won’t) [2/18 Without a premium account, you can easily lose 100k-200k credits if you have a not-so-great game in a tier X ship, which discourages you from bringing them out and having fun in hitting the capstone in a ship line.]-And why yes, premium ships are overpowered, making the game unbalanced[2/18 Balancing a game is difficult, yes. And while I do admire the developers for not nerfing ships people paid money for, it does create problems. Recently, some ships like the Belfast were offered a refund because of a significant mechanic change. However, it does make things like ranked play difficult if there is an overpowered ship in the tier, because you can count on it being in your match. To be fair, the community does a lot of screeching if a preview of a premium is underpowered, but that is actually a better situation to introduce them underpowered rather than have an OP ship be untouchable.]Which brings me to the ugly:-The aircraft carriers (CVs) are completely out of whack, ruin the rock-paper-scissors balancing, and that one ship can ruin the entire match (There is a reason why carriers revolutionized naval warfare, and the game promotes a pre-carrier battle with aircraft carriers). If you CV captain forgot his brain at home, you will likely get blown up by the enemy CV, as there is little you can do to defend against enemy planes. [2/18 Grouping will likely not save you, unless you are in a clan match with a highly coordinated team. All you are left to do is either pray that there is no CV, or throw a bunch of AA on your ship, thereby gimping it and making it a problem. The AA spec everything is also not fun for the CV, as he just has to sit there and do almost nothing all game. Being a total wash should not depend on the grace of the matchmaker, but rather the skill of the team.]-Horizontal imbalance: ships from the same tier, but different nations are astoundingly out of whack.  [2/18 Once again, balancing is hard, but constantly throwing new mechanics in new ship/national lines makes your job more difficult.]-The power creep is real, and recently released ships pound their predecessors into the water. [2/18 Considering that a certain RN tier X BB nerf is in the works, the developers might be getting a bit more sensitive to this.]-Vertical imbalance: You will get overmatched in a battle, up to two tiers. A tier V battleship cannot take a tier VII battleship on a tier VII map. You end up either slow and irrelevant or blown to bits in one of the faster ships. [2/18 While Steam provided a slight increase in player base, it did not provide enough to alleviate the problem in middle tiers. Those players likely quit out of frustration, and might be lost to the void, leaving WoWs right at square one.]-Developer attitudes to player base are adversarial: they bully critical streamers into avoiding negative reviews, and are only remorseful when they are caught and the community backlash forces them to apologize. I’ve seen more customer cooperation from my internet provider and most US airlines. [2/18 This is a bit on the mend. Wargaming has avoided sticking their foot in it since November (an improvement in and of itself.) The developers and community outreach has been much more active on Reddit and their forums with Sub_Octavian. Further, Wargaming seems to have become more receptive to player feedback and are working on improvements. However, based on the developer responses (from November, so they might have improved) some old habits die hard, and instead of saying ""We're sorry you had problems, and thank you for giving us suggestions."" or ""While we know we have problems in our game, we are working to correct them."" we have a point-by-point argument or simple contradiction rather than an attempt at reconciliation. This is indicative of the attitude that can kill so many great games.]While I really enjoy this game, I can’t support it in its current form with its current development team. At such a high cost for its premium content, the flaws should have been fixed a year ago. It has a great base mechanic, but not having the support it deserves drives players like me away. I hope to someday give it a good review, but that is not today.[2/18 Unfortunately, there hasn't been enough improvement to the game for me to recommend it. Where there has been improvement, it has not been remarkable enough to change my attitude towards WoWs. I want to give this game a positive review, because there is so much potential, but  it is so frustrating to watch it get squandered.",Fri Dec 31 04:25:21 EET 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

ce7dce78-96d4-432c-9e68-4e23432931ca,5,"""I never played Metro 2033, so at first glance; I figured I was in for a Fallout 3 clone.  An expansive 25-hour journey with a compelling story littered with tangential side quests set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. While the setting is the same, that’s where their similarities end.\n\nMetro: Last Light is a very linear first person shooter, incorporating stealth and resource management. Neither of these seemed necessary when playing on normal difficulty, so for the intended experience, I’d suggest a harder mode. It paces itself well; shifting between slow moments of atmospheric storytelling, faster paced combat and the occasional boss fight. But the FPS side of this game is not it’s strongest attribute. Your character never levels up in any way, or gains any new abilities (unless you count night vision). Aside from increasing the Kalash’s ammo, the weapon modifications made little difference on any of the wide selection of guns. If you’re looking for a shoot’em up gibfest, this isn’t the game; but certain mechanics enhance the realism and improve the experience. The best example of this being the gas mask, which the player must put on when going above ground, replace when damaged, recharge with scavenged filters and wipe off when covered with blood, debris or water.\n\nThe part of this game that really shines is the storytelling, or more specifically, the tone. It’s classified as horror, but it lacks the jump scares and excessive gore one might expect from this genre. Instead it has a more mature and suspenseful disposition reinforced by the dimly lit yet detailed level design. Unlike a run and gun shooter, Metro: Last Light encourages the player to patiently explore it’s environment, taking in the scenery and appreciating it. Notes revealing more of the story are randomly scattered throughout the levels, forcing the player to search in areas that would otherwise be passed without notice.\n\nGraphically the game is great, considering the budget this studio had. Sure, the character animation is a bit stiff and the child voice acting is awful but the character models are good enough to not distract from the story and, like the movie Gravity, this game is a rare example of a product that becomes a different experience when using 3D. I’ve found 3D becomes tiresome in most games and I turn it off after a while, even 3D Vision Ready ones such as Metro: Last Light. But I played all 10 hours of this game with Nvidia 3D Vision enabled and it intensified the immersion in a way that couldn’t be accomplished otherwise (most notably when the gas mask was cracked or dirtied). As unpopular as 3D gaming is, I’m glad I have it for games like this. It’s also worth noting that the game runs on Mac as well as Linux.\n\nI don’t like moral choice (karma) systems in games, but I don’t hate them; and there are ways of ameliorating them. One such method, employed by Metro: Last Light, is to hide it completely from the player, allowing them to make organic decisions during gameplay. The game has a good or bad ending, depending on certain choices and actions but the player is not told when something affects this moral meter or what their reward is for following a righteous path. Unfortunately, any semi-experienced gamer will recognize the telltale signs of a moral choice system (such as the option to kill or spare a defeated enemy), but at least this game tries.\n\nThese aren’t my favorite type of games, but playing through Metro: Last Light was one of the better single player experiences I’ve had, and if you have the patience to let the ambiance build I think you’ll enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n[url=dlgaming.net]Digital Logik PC Gaming[/url]""",Wed Dec 29 02:08:58 EET 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

As a free-to-play game you don't feel pressured to spend money just to compete or to complete which makes for a very well-balanced game.",Mon Jun 28 01:40:47 EEST 2021,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

I understand some people complain about grinding, or about purchasing things etc. However, there are two things which make this formula acceptable, and here is why: the Devs continually modify and add to the game - they can't be expected to work for free. Secondly, in no way do you feel like you need to buy stuff with real money. If truth be told, most of what you might buy would either be some specific ships or extra docks (and of course, the EC cap). Sure, you can buy whatever else you'd like if you really want to, but you don't really need to. Considering that Zen is the currency which can be bought with real money, it should be noted that dilithium (an ingame only currency) can be obtained and then traded for Zen.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: PROS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Spock... is in the game. Leonard Nimoy's voice lives on in the game, alongside many, many other characters.Game mechanics are really good, and I consider them to be the norm on which any space game should be created upon.You can customize your characters with a fairly decent amount of costumes.An incredibly huge assortment of ships, and always growing.The Borg... as powerful as advertised in the shows and movies.Content has been either changed or removed/added in the past to improve the storyline.Every faction (Fed/Klingon/Rom) have a specific storyline until it merges.Each faction has a huge assortment of ships to select.Crafting system is extremely simple, and unique items can be obtained in such a way.Select whatever type of weapon types: phaser, disruptor, polaron, tetryon, anti-proton, plasma and other.Good voice acting.Global official giveaways - ships and items - and special events.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CONS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::The Borg... they drain your shields like it was nothing, and you can't do a thing about it - but that's also a Pro.Not as much content as I'd like.You do have to grind quite a bit, depending on what you want to achieve.The reputation system doesn't unlock every tier for every character once unlocked (this process is tedious), and takes 20 days at the very least, and 40 days initially (20 days once you obtain Sponsorship Tokens).Not enough costumes, hairstyles or beardstyles.Some specific characters cannot be modified, costume wise.Some races are not playable (yet), such as Cardassians, Breen, Vortas/Jem'Hadar, although you can usually create the look of most of them. Takes a while, of course.Personally, I have experienced frequent disconnects at some point (not always, but maybe once a month).Graphics are a bit dated, despite some improvements. Since game plays very well, and most players only care about space battles, it doesn't matter as much. ",Fri Mar 12 09:53:04 EET 2021,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

Game contains ""premium"" ships and ""premium"" weapons, which are well balanced. Thing is, this game is very hard to master.To make it clear, I killed many battle cruisers and other battle ships with scientific ships. How?You need to have these skills.1) Combat strategy. You cant just fly straight to enemy and kill him, you have to find weakness, like slow turning speed, or slow weapon recharge and use it for yourself. There are many ways how to kill other player with ""premium ship"" because his ship cant turn so fast as yours, so you keep being away from his weapons firing range and still shoot at him.2) Buy/Sell strategy. You have to buy and sell weapons and other stuff. You have scientific vessel, its having great shields. Now you need weapons. You cant buy just any, you have to be sure they can fire effectively and you can shoot everywhere. Boost your shields or new weapon? There are many decisions about fitting your ship and buying new stuff. Premium weapons can make you ""OP"". But same can do weapons from market for ingame money.3) RPG skills for ground fight.

08b76eb1-67ec-47fe-9392-c3a9e68854c8,5,"For those people who like MMO RPG games and Star Trek. Head out and start star treking.Depends though however how you like to trek. Lets make one thing clear you dont play this game to explore. If you want to do that play bridge crew. This game is heavily focused on a kill or be killed Star Trek adventure. With many different weapons, both ground and space, and ships, one can not simply have enough. Is this game pay to win?Honestly not in the way you think. First off dont play PVP, as someone who has bought ships even I hate PVP, some people have death dreadnaught able to slam you while you barely dent them. However, PVE allows any ship from free to premium. Premium currency exists as well as loot boxes, no surprise as it is free to play. However, you dont actually need to buy any. Every Summer and every Winter there is an event that everyone can play and by doing a short mission everyday for a couple days you are given a free ship which is on level with the new one released all the time (T6 ship). Those ships however, are not as iconic as the ones you would get with premium currency. Now you can grind the premium currency but it will take you a very very long time. In that case it is pay for convenience. The loot box system is unintrusive, unless you are a ship collector with some ships going for exuberant prices. All in all I like this game. I feel that if it keeps up with its numbers it could last a while and with the introduction of another faction right around the corner, who knows how long we will be able to cruise the galaxy together.",Wed Oct 20 23:49:05 EEST 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

This isn't Dota you have a full array of abilities to chose from, my Naga gets a lot of use. I am really enjoying the Science vessel it is my kind of play style and feels like a character in itself. There are hundred of different ways you can play the ships. Having a science vessel but then having a tactical team or a mix of all. You even chose the different officers on your ship which then opens up different abilities which you can choose from.You get duty officers alos which you can send on mission and this can level you, get skill points and dilithium.I havent finished learning the game, there seems like there is much more and they are always improving it and adding new seasons.",Tue Apr 28 20:05:45 EEST 2020,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

1ac9d5ce-d789-4d73-87d8-c389d2826ea2,3,"STO has... come a long way from when I first started this.At this moment, 5 years on, lots of changes, and I gotta say at least its moving in the right direction and worth it at least for that.I dunno, whenever it first went free to play, that's when I started this first. Long before I had Steam, back when it was vastly different than what I have seen now.Finding myself getting back to this gem was a nice refreshing taste of nostalgia - and a bit of dissapointment. Some of what I saw as the more fun and Trek-like gameplay is gone. Random missions is replaced with sporatic patrols that shift daily that you need to find. But despite the loss, there is so much more added I can really start to appreciate this game, and willing to admit I'm a lifer now. I've come back to this game time and time again - and it does hold an aspect that I see worth visiting.Many of the old, glitchy, unwanted parts (and I bet many of the negative reviews here are based on those) are long since gone. New elements have been added to help encourage a wider and more varried feel to the game. Many aspects have been added or changed to encourage development of really impressive improvements. R&D got an overhaul with the Duty Officers you gain, making it easier to earn good stuff - and add the possibility of making your own unique and impressive equipment. Bridge Officers have the ability to learn multiple skills, so you can have just a few favorites for the ideal team mix but still have the ability to shift what powers they use to simplify things in certain situations. Player Traits have been vastly overhauled. Parts of it I regret missing, you can't have an overpowered selection of a dozen or more Reputation traits powering you up - but you can now shift between selections in certain areas not in combat zones. And the mixing is balanced out well so far.You can make your captain and crew into what you dream here, in many surprising ways.But comes the only glaring problem I see - its an MMO. Its a kill or be killed area where damage is king. Grinding is a must and you gotta mow down mobs en masse. RP'ers will find some loss in certain builds and styles just not up to par - and if you want the top gear, you'll need to grind. And some grinds can't be done without a certain level of killing strength, so some things - just can't cut it. Doesn't feel very Trek at times. But I can't really call that a truly negative part at the moment.STO is Trek, just not the TV or Movie Trek. Its another Trek, in another galaxy. Another mirrored universe almost where you need to adapt to new enemies and threats. And face a hard truth. Kill or be killed.Outside of that, the game itself is showing an unbelieveable ammount of improvements over time. Focusing more on gameplay mechanics to help make enjoying the game easier. You just need to learn that over time.The Trek part? Well, its there. Cameoes, nods, and a great deal of effort in stories. But some of the later aspects really don't fit like I wish they did. But this isn't really the same Trek I would want it to be. Its not bad, just different. Can't honestly fault that anymore.Its a good MMO, with good merits and definetly something I could reccomend as you could find what you want in here somewhere - it certainly does have its size to go for it. That and the Foundry. Player-created content is a huge aspect of the game and if you got the time, you'll find a whole slew of additions to content and story that makes this game well worth the visit. The hard part is just finding it.But that's a bit of the charm. There is so much here, so much possibility. There is good, and bad - but overall, its trying a respectable rate to be better. I gotta admit that's worth it itself.Now the somewhat dated graphics and cartain core elements - well, that's just cause its an older game. But don't let that dissuade you here. You'll find something worth visiting, and even more worth coming back for. I know I have.",Sat Sep 19 13:22:56 EEST 2020,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

32934f80-e229-459d-85d0-d78943ee953a,7,"I have been playing this game for a while now, and it has become one of my all-time favorites. Star Trek Online allows one to fulfill all of their dreams of having a role in Star Trek. You have the option of three (four if you count the semi TOS version of the Feds) options for your character, Federation, Romulans, and the Klingons. Many actors from the series have come on as voice actors to portray their characters. The game also allows you to progress from and Ensign to a Fleet Admiral (Using Federation ranks). As for the gameplay itself, you have a ship on ship combat and away team combat. The ship combat can be as complicated as you want it, you could spam fire all weapons, or set up loadouts and your crews abilities and tailor your actions to each combat scenario. The ground combat is from a third person perspective and is more of a point and click type of conflict than anything else. So far, I have not had an issue with repetitively because of foundry missions. These are missions created by other players, and some are very good. The missions that are produced by the developers are usually good. However, there may be a few bad ones that you may want to take advantage of the ""skip"" button. Overall, this is an excellent game worth a try. However, keep in mind that it will take more than a few minutes to get into it.",Sat Aug 28 19:22:13 EEST 2021,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f
bbf740b6-05a0-49af-a9bc-f2f7cffa6f12,8,"Well, what to say about Star Trek Online... Steam says 1900 hours, but i bet its like 2200 already without the Steam Client. i played it from the beginning, not constantly , but now and then with friends. Is it old and feels a bit clunky? Yes. Could it use an overhaul? Yes. Is it good? Hell yes! Even with its outdated graphics and technology, this game is still somewhat addictive and fun, especially when you play it with friends. It is a free to play model, that is true. But most content (also endgame related content) is free and you can gain it via missions and work. The so called ""grind"" is something that you can do on a stand-by, since its literally getting some simple ressources (5 - 10 min work) and then clicking on ""earn reputation"" , and wait 20 hours to complete the task. That is literally all you have to do for ""endgame content"". No hours and hours of hard work with repetetive fighting and gathering. While the graphics isnt something everyone likes, this game gives you a very good executed story with hours of voice-overs, interesting missions and complete customization. You want your crew to wear a special uniform? Go for it! You want to customize your own skills, your crew skills and the weaponry of your character, your crew (away team) AND your ship? Go for it! You dont like Starfleet? You would rather play a deceptive Romulan with their cool ships, or a warmonger Klingon with a massive dreadnought? Go for it! This game has massive customization options, hundrets of ships, and an interesting take on ""Quests"". You hate being send to get some random drops like wolf-fangs or bear-claws with your task being slaughtering hundrets of monsters to finally get the drops to your npc? Well, Star Trek Online has NONE of such quests. Every single mission is literally a story, with you and your crew flying through the galaxy to distant planets and fighting huge battleships with torpedos, phasers and disruptors, but also holstering your guns and rifles and beaming down to get into dangerous close quarter combat in an enemy base to rescue hostages or find artefacts. True, they could have done the controls a bit better, but if you are able to literally adjust your controls and keymapping  to your liking, you will have alot of fun. I only say: ""Switch to shooter mode!"" , and turn your mmo in a third person shooter. If you are a Star Trek Nerd, you even can write your own log files. Oh, you have done all the story missions, and raids and fleet actions are nothing for you? How about you play one of the ten-thousands of missions of the foundry? Its a pool of community created missions that are mostly checked by the developers and being rated by players. Even there you have voice over. There is literally ""endless ingame content"" if you are searching for missions and quests en mass. And if you are a munchkin who likes to jingle a bit with numbers and calculations about the best gear, visit the Star Trek Online wiki and loose your mind about how much you can learn and do here. XDDont let yourself get tricked by ""only"" 3 classes... engineer, tactical or science. The class choice is literally only for selecting your base-abilities of ""you wanna do damage"" , ""you wanna heal or control"" or ""you wanna have a mixture of both"" . You can be a tactical player with grenades, supressing fire and damage buffs, while also flying a science ship or a cruiser. You are not bound by class, and you can literally choose your skills freely. All in all, i can promise that the game offers many options and gameplay mechanics that may be unusual for an mmo, but if you can overlook its age and the sometimes little technical problems, you will find a gem that can literally brighten up your day. Do some ships or species cost money? Yes, but honestly, this game has potential to entertain you far more than any actuall tripple A title with their usual 20 hours of storyplay, so you can honor the developers hard work with a few bucks to spend on this game. If i am generous with my calculation and even say a tripple A title would have 30 hours of entertainment in storyline, i would have had to buy 66 games to entertain me that long like Star Trek Online did. So yeah, have my 20 bucks for a nice endgame ship and let me play some more. ^^",Sat Jan 01 04:34:39 EET 2022,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

bbf740b6-05a0-49af-a9bc-f2f7cffa6f12,10,"Recommended if: You love Star Trek and want to be the star of your own Star Trek show in which you are the captain and you have your own custom crew, ship, and decisions. Design your own starships! You can even design the uniform! Come on!You can fly your ship through enemy space, brush up against cameos of your favorite characters, boldy go where noone has gone before, bounce the graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish, and explore strange new worlds to your heart's content!True, the game is dated, but the graphics are NOT bad for an 8 year old game. The character models are better than many games I've played and there's a decent amount of customization. I like playing really true-to-show experiences, but the ""make your own alien"" option was amazingly fun. Whether you want to make a race one could TOTALLY believe was in a Trek world somewhere, or create a hideous (or hilarious) abomination, the system is great fun. Worth fiddling with even if you won't play one, just to see what you can do with it.Seriously, the moment I stepped into the story and started flying my own ship around, I was living out my Trekkie fantasies of my own show with a captain just how I wanted her. I played a Trill after the nature of my favorite character ever (Jadzia Dax of course!) and the tutorial was barely over before I started reading the dialogue out loud and giving orders verbally, including whatever Trek-no-babble I could manage, just for the fun of it. Yes, I'm a giant geek, but I totally recommend you let yourself give into the urge to just ENJOY this game for what it does well: a wonderful story full of content that well and truly makes you feel like whatever character you chose to be.Play it for the story. Your own Star Trek story. Play this as a delightfully free story-driven action/adventure title and you will not be disappointed.Not-recommended if: You want to play it for other reasons than the story. You want a thriving, living game with a solid, friendly community. You want to have the best stuff, the shiniest ships, and truly be able to compete  in the end-game scene, and you don't have a ton of money to spend.

The story missions are pretty enjoyable compared to most MMO's, and make you feel involved in the plot rather than just as a witness to it. Also unlike other MMOs you aren't stuck doing gathering/kill quests to advance, but instead you are doing stuff to advance storylines. It was refreshing to play through an MMO that felt more like a proper story-based game.At times it feels like a strange fanfic of what happens next in the original universe, but it's still Star Trek.

fb28232f-f358-473f-a2dd-36e0d81d6c9b,7," To boldly go where no series has gone before! Star Trek Online has come a long way from the 49.99 shelf price I picked it up at. From beaming down to that alien world of your favorite Star Trek episode, to fighting the Borg across the sector. Each piece culminates into a game anyone who enjoys Sci-fi can love. Trekkies of course get the opportunity to visit each of those scenes they loved most in Star Trek.The current iteration of Star Trek Online is quite simply put, 'Marvelous' and only getting better with the addition of the Delta Quadrant. PVE is the main focus, but PVP is possible in specified battle zones. Surprisingly, and a wonderful touch in my opinion—has been the growing addition of Voice Actors for a number of main quests, and most importantly, voice acting by actual Star Trek actors, come to replay their digital roles. Some of STO’s original voice acting flops, but they have gotten very good at putting the proper emotion behind their voice actor’s character. Each new addition is far better than the last. More than anything else, in this game…the story is perhaps the cherry on top. Wrapping the player into a universe that is similar, and yet so very different from the shows we used to watch. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction of any kind, just wants to kill things in space ships, or loves a good story.

New ship teir upgrades seem to be just a way to get more money from people for getting them to pay for upgrading their ships to the new level cap... overall would say game is going down hill in terms of enjoyablity, but still there is a lot of content and story you can play for free... but you can and do play it all solo... so i guess the big question is, why is this called an MMO, other than chat and a great friendly community, there really isn't a lot (or any) multiplayer gaming involved...Love this game. Stays true to Star Trek style without getting to MMO gimmicky. For a long long time (years and years) there was no level cap increase, which I liked.

Made it more about the gameplay and less about grinding.Pros: Giant emersive star trek universeRidiculous amout of missions and contentRPG style for both your main character, you bridge officers and your ship adds a nice changeSpace combat is awersome. dynamic fights and strategy plays a large part in success not just better gear. yet still simple enough and not to complicated like Wing Commander where on top of everything else you need to learn to fly. Cons:PVP is very limiting. there are two factions at war, but PVP feels like a trapped collaseum of bashing each other till another ship explodes, pvp matches are also limited to how many people can fight. Compared to other MMO RPGs with PVP where you are running around with 30 or 40 other people it feels less MM and more like a group of friends came over for board game night. Ground combat: ground missions add a great change to space missions for sure, and the unique skills, puzzles, and enemies types keeps things interesting. and while I have seen some people group for ground 'raids' to get crystals and gear, the game makes it less enjoyable to actually participate in ground combat and has no insentive for ground PVP so no one really does it.Crafting: crafting has changed a lot over the years in this game. the first version was cool cause it was very 'Star Trek' like with various types of crafting each with sub crafting types, very star trek specialization. I liked this for this reason, made me feel more apart of the star trek universe. However, and understandable so, it made being able to craft everything incredible difficult (if thats what you want, its not for me, but I know lots of MMO gamers who do) and required 100's of specific and different crafting materials. So they changed it. simplifed a bunch of it, and reduced mats, and got rid of the sub specities.... then I took a year off the game and came back,... and it was changed again... even more simplfied but also now completly useless. None of the craftable gear was anything you would ever want to use. The had changed the way the 'fleet' bases worked and all the gear that was worth 'crafting/buying' was now sold at your fleets starbase. (the rest of the gear worth getting became reputation gear from the borg/omega/romulan expansions).Last con: this game has changed owners so many times and each time different people try to do different things with it and it has changed the way the game is played.  Perpetual Entertainment started working on it for the first 4 years, i signed up with them to be notifed when the game was ready and for beta testing, When Cryptic Studios took over development after Perpetual went bankrupt and started their codebase from scratch, I was never informed and the list I signed up for on the website was never transfered over and it was kinda ridiculous when I found out I had to sign up again. Atari did a really good job of adding new missions to the game but when they no longer wanted to be in the MMO ring they sold the game (and other MMOs) to Perfect World Entertainment, who already owned a vast array of MMO games. Although PWE has done some really good things for STO (the last two expansions were great), they changed the in game currancy and micro cash transaction system to match their exisiting games that clearly make them money, and they baught STO to make them money so it makes sense but it also made STO less like a star trek MMO in a star trek universe and more like a very 'gamey' environment, where everything was setup to game you into buying things. Which completly changed the dynamic and how the game was played in a not so positive way (if you were enjoying the star trek universe anyway). Its still a great game, just feels more like a futuristic sci-fi game now and less like you are in the star trek universie. I list this as a con because who knows who will own it next or what they will do with it.",Sat Aug 21 00:25:46 EEST 2021,1ecec3cb-048c-4f0d-b89d-e1a92a3fa773

2ab77e6e-e2fe-4207-beb3-83a21568d35e,10,"This game has come a long, long way since I began playing about 3-4 years ago. Back then it was like a hollow shell, filled with boring things to do, not many cool things and mostly it was just kind of bland. Now, however, they've totally revamped the game it's no longer what it used to be. It's fun, engaging, exciting and for us Trekkies (LLAP!   \\//,) it's become the game we all wanted it to be. I highly recommend it for any Sci-fi fan, Trekkie, MMORPG'er or mixed FPS/3rd Person style gamer, it doesnt play like any other game I've played. It has an incredibly versatile battle system for fighting in space and on the ground. They've bulked it up with exsquisitely created fan mods which are stories you can playthrough...basically player created DLC. They've added all kinds of new types of missions: diplomatic, space missions, research missions, ground missions of all sorts, away team missions and lots of sweet new gear to boot. The characters themselves look the best they've ever looked; when I first began playing I was very disappointed in the way they looked, they were all sort of the same looking. Now, the characters have tight gear and outfits that are totally unique (assuming you have some epic stuff to equip and in some cases, even if you don't!).                               As you continue to level up, you just look cooler and cooler. The ships are sick as well and since you can choose 3 separate factions (Klingon, Romulan, Fedreration) then you have a choice of some sweet Romulan ships (which are all epic thanks to their singularity warp drive ftw) or if you want a cool Klingon Bird-of-Prey or a classic (or newer!) Federation ship (also, any race can play any faction). The weapons have become more and more epic over the years just like everything else in STO. 100% Worth a shot, if you've been uncertain about whether or not to go for it, now would be the time.

b13afc03-9c73-4fc6-8ec1-7ecb5aefb461,4,"I joined this game only after it transition to the Free-to-play model and am basing this review off of that experience, and is a well above average concept for a free-to-play MMO. With a high production value, quite remarkable music score and high quality dialogue for what little dialogue there is the game feels quite polished to date. For the Starship junkie such as myself, the ships look detailed and true to canon. The main quest is gripping and enjoyable, it makes levelling a breeze with a good balance of investment and reward as your character levels.In contrast to other free-to-play MMO’s, the micro-transactions in this game are kept to a minimum; most purchases made from the Cash shop are entirely cosmetic, which have little to no impact on game-play, and are not necessary in the progression of your character. In addition to that, the in-game currency Dilithium can be converted to large sums of cash shop credit, offering economical alternatives for those that don’t wish to outlay any cash, but spend vast amounts of time playing.Space combat is one of its strengths, you will have direct control over your ship and its stations with everything laid-out in front of you. Basic Starship operation and commands are very intuitive with control tight and concise. Yet, ground combat is another story. On the ground, your skills are vastly different from that in space, how effective your combat will be will be dependent on the your chosen away team, with the focus on movement, your equipment and environmental hazards, as well as the groups of varying enemies. Coupled with the rather basic RPG style of button mashing to complete your attach, ground missions will wear out their welcome sooner rather than later.Space exploration itself is somewhat of a disappointment, for an open-world title, the experience you’ll have amongst the different sectors and its planets are at best, predictable and simple. Most missions comprise of destroying ships or scanning structures. While the strong story arc helps break the monotony and generally tie pieces together, most of the open-world encounters have little to no plot or reward for your time invested.In comparison to other MMO’s, the amount of content can be scarce, once you have reached your characters level cap and completed the official episodes you will have very little to do, especially if you’re the one to play solo. Playing with a friend or joining a guild will be highly recommended to break the monotony of grinding and the entertainment flowing. While all MMO’s have their fair share of grinding, the problem here is the lack of variety on what to grind at. For a free-to-play MMO, this game does stand-out amongst the rest. It’s well-polished, true to Star Trek lore and canon and an enjoyable experience within a group, and on the plus side, you get to be a Star Ship Captain. As a relatively high-quality product, it’s the community that will once again let it down. Every on-line game has its fair share of elitists and career orientated players that often need to stop and brush the Dorito crumbs from their neck-beards every once in a while and thankfully the community can be filtered out.",Wed Apr 29 01:39:18 EEST 2020,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

b13afc03-9c73-4fc6-8ec1-7ecb5aefb461,4,"Right, I think I've played enough of this now, to be able to give a review and being an MMO its pretty simple review as well.*Though I did end up waffling on, oops. So read on for the full waffle otherwise...Pros' - Free, Trekkie, Story, Ground & Space combat.Cons - Pricey, Grindy.If you like MMO's, which in gerneral I don't, then you'll probably like this. Theres is plenty of busy work, as I call it, stuff to grind at to unlock better stuff and when you get to Level 50+ you unlock even more busy stuff to keep you busy for litterally hours as well as the usual events that these sort of things have, such as the recent Christmas event, which I joined into too late, so I ignored it.A big word of warning though, the game does a really poor job of explaining most of these mechanics and you'll be left asking the community questions alot.However I have been taking part, mostly, to the 7th Anniversary event that is currently on as of writing. Which again is very grindy and not really my thing but like I said if your into MMO's you'll probably love this, as its abit different to others that I've tried over the years, it has the 3rd person combat, that seems to be most MMo's style but also the space combat, which is also 3rd person, so basically the same combat mechanic really but it does vary it just enough to keep things aleast abit more interesting.However, if your not into MMO's but your either a Trekkie like myself or maybe a fan of RPG, then I would suggest giving this a go as well. As if your a Trekkie then, its a chance to be your 'own Captain', which four different gaming openings which do really good job of drawing you into the story of the universe on offer. However its got too be said that once you get past the opening intros, then it really just sidelines you into either the Federation of the Klingon paths and even them do have cross over stories with each other.But saying that, if your not a Trekkie but an RPG fan, then you probs still like this, as the stories aleast on the first time of playing through are interesting to keep you play.Like I said, I'm not a MMO fan but I am a Trekkie and a RPG fan, so I've been playing mostly just through the story, ignoring all the padding and I'll probs stop playing once I've finished the main game story, treat it just like an normal RPG in essence rather than MMO.And lets face it is free, so why not? However like most games of this time, the in game purchases are rather expensive. To buy a first Tier ship (the first class of ship you can unlock), its basically £5, with the second tier being a £10. And it keeps climbing to tier 6. So obviously I havent spent a penny on it, and at these prices I won't be either. If the ships cost say £1 each, regardless of tier then being a Trekkie I would be more tempted. As you unlock more ships after every 10 levels, luckly you are given a free ship every 10 levels as well, so as you upgraded to a stronger class of ship requirement, the game does let you keep pace without spending money but your selection for a free ship is at most a choice between three, so as a Trekkie your always saying, awww but I want that ship! But given the choice I'd rather spend the money of an actual physical model, so developers making it cheaper if you want my cash!",Sat Dec 04 21:48:35 EET 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

64be7da9-a5b5-4c09-8912-0ece05f5abf7,3,"I started playing in the middle of 2013. and did enjoy it till the recent launch of Delta Rising (DR). Before DR it was fun to get in and play the content, and grinding was not the only focus in the game. However, that has now changed.Don't get me wrong, going from level 1-50 is still as enjoyable as before. It is when you get to level 50 that you feel like you are punished for doing so. The DR expansion gave us a new level cap of 60. However, there is not enough mission content to help you level up.They want us to now repeatedly run patrol missions for stupid amount of times just for one level. This is to keep players in the game longer, instead of offering content to keep players in the game longer, like before.Everything is being monetized. They are revamping things in the game, just to try to monetize it. The crafting system, and now the Bridge Officer (BOFF) system. Also, they created an upgrade system that they are using to monetize on by asking outrageous amounts of Dilithium for them also.Just to clearify, Dilithium is the most expensive resource in STO. It can be used to exchange for Zen (their game store to buy stuff in), or to buy gear that is usualy better quality weapons or gear than mission rewards, or loot drops. There is Dilithium ore, which is what you get for rewards, and Refined Dilithium, which is what you turn the Dilithium ore into. The major problem is that you can only refine 8,000 per day, per character.With the extreme amounts of Dilithium requirements in the game now, it is near impossible for a new player (casual or hard core) to reach a competitive state without paying out real money for Zen to convert into Dilithium. But, before the DR expansion, it was easy for a very casual player to reach a level where they were competetive in just a few months.Instead of fixing isues with the game being unbalanced, they sell power creep. A lot of bugs go unfixed, and many have been in the game since before I started playing.When I first started playing, I would have, and did recommend it to other people. I was able to see the potential the game had. Yet, over the years it has turned into a game that focused on punishing grind after grind to replace actual content. And there is so much grind in the game that it strongly encourages players to spend money to get the new power creep, so you can do it just a little bit faster.The game is now in a sad state. The main developer that oversees the game even admited that he doesn't care what players (their customers) say, and has repeatedly insulted players, and even accused them of exploiting the game, when it was being played as it was designed by them.I would not recommend Star Trek Online till it is no longer about nothing but money, money, money. When the game is turned back into an actual game, then I will start recommending it again. Though, till new management is brought in, or the management they now have will stop focusing on money, and make the game fun, I can't see that happening.",Wed Oct 27 16:07:37 EEST 2021,35813a73-6674-4f54-a7ff-3ac4c122d581

What I can write is why I think it's a masterpiece while not spoiling it.\n\nIf you want an open world experience where the world feels alive, NPC live their lives and where stories unfold with or without your active involvement this is the game for you. Just riding around between missions you will get so many random events, some of them even forming little stories that even after 100 hours I was still finding new things. Save a man from his own bear trap? Meet the same fellow in a nearby town few days later and he gives you a reward. Pickup a stranded girl and bring her home, get some information that helps you later. This type of event's make it feel like individuals have their own life and good or bad luck. \n\nActivities that you can do are plentiful and integrate very well into the game. Even collectable mission are something you do for extra cash and you can do them in increments. This makes it so natural during gameplay and it's not something you go out to do just to achieve 100%. Finding cards and bones just happens while exploring, hunting or fishing. Not to mention that there are so many interiors, shacks, houses, whole farms that you can explore, steal and murder your way through them. \n\nAll of this makes the world of RDR2 one of the best open worlds out there. Ubisoft should take a note here. This is how you make a open world work. Every mechanic stands alone but also is seemingly integrated with the general feel of the game.\n\nStory is I would say Rockstar going to their original quality. Memorable main and side characters. Through story, side mission and activities you get to know them and they become part of the experience. This leads to questioning any available decision that the game throws at you whit great caution. I feel that they took a different path than in GTA 5 where side characters kinda felt like a mean to an end while here they are your friends and you actually care for them. Your character Arthur has a very unique progression. Without spoiling anything he is a man that tries to live in the ever changing world  going through industrialization. He is learning to cope that the old days are gone and trying to find a purpose in this new era. Even if you don't do any side activities just playing through the story is a worthwhile experience.\n\nThe downsides are very few. There is some jittering of animations in towns that happens at random. I also experiences a bug when toggle to aim was on so I had to play with hold to aim option and one quest was bugged from progressing due to a known bug.\nBesides bugs I would love to see the eating and drinking mechanics serve a more survival purpose. I loved going up to the mountain rationing and hunting for food.\n\nAll in all this game pulled me in and didn't let me go until I finished it. It's a unique experience that I would recommend to everyone. Only regret is that I didn't start playing it sooner!""",Sat Dec 11 19:48:17 EET 2021,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

It took nearly two years for me to get Grand Theft Auto V, I've only recently gotten Left 4 Dead 2, and I'm still trying to convince myself to get Spore. But after years of playing in the online virtual world ""Second Life"".. and having a lot of fun hanging out with Star Trek roleplayers in SL.. when this game was announced, well.. I went a little crazy.I pre-ordered a lifetime subscription. During beta. I can only speak to the game's features as a ""gold"" member.. but what I can say is that this game is pretty epic.. for what it's trying to be.I had very limited experience with MMO type games prior to STO. I've since learned that some of the 'failings' of my initial reactions to STO were just indemic to the whole MMO drama (flawed animations, no lip syncing to spoken cutscenes, combat that was rudimentary in some areas, or overly power based, etc).Once I got USED to what MMO's are like, I returned to STO, and to be honest, I really do love this game. The graphics are gorgeous, the ship and costume customization options are pretty amazing, and once I got used to all the various powers and systems and things, it can actually be a lot of fun. The story lines can be a little cheesy in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.. there's often a little sarcastic comedy thrown in that keeps doing throwbacks to the various series.The graphics for this game are what amaze me most tho. Every single screenshot I take, looks like something off the cover of a Star Trek novel. Whether it's a space shot, or a picture on an alien planet, walking around starfleet academy, or whatever. It is truly a lovely game.Honestly, if you love Star Trek, and you like MMO's, this game will probably be a great fit for you.And hey, it's free to play. Give it a try.

Two years ago the game used to be simple and smart, the combat mechanics were easy to learn and you could become a master in several ways. Spending real money wasn't necessary if you were playing at least once per day.Then, this perfection started to slowly fade: they released lock-boxes (another pay to win way to obtain the best ships), significantly increased the costs of equipment, introduced tons of bugs (some fixed, but not all) and released new P2W stuff like rain. Moreover, they completely ruined PvP (actually, Devs never cared about PvP, now is unplayable) and, above all, made Engineers and Scientists useless, or at least much lower than Tacticians, since the only thing that currently matters is DPS.I'm Leader of a good Federation fleet, 100% Free To Play (yes, I haven't spent money for it yet, but it's extremely hard) and currently a better player than 99,999% of the community.

13170bb3-c2b4-4ad1-b96d-3b79299aa38a,3,"  Star Trek Online is an oddity among games. While most that have bad releases generally die off after a short period of time, not only has Star Trek Online survived for years, its become a wildly successful MMORPG... and for very good reason. Of all the Star Trek being produced right now, this game risks to cover a period of time that nobody else seems to want to touch anymore: The Future, several decades after the events of Star Trek Nemesis and Deep Space Nine.  I am a massive Star Trek fan. This has made a lot of the single-player games to be very lack-luster to me since most of them force you into a specific role and generally its one of an action hero, something that is contrary to what Star Trek was supposed to be. Other then the adventure games like 'A Final Unity', '25th Anniversary' and 'Judgement Rites', most Star Trek games completely miss the spirit of the show. This game, while having a definite focus on combat, breaks up the fighting with numerous other mini-games, tasks, and puzzles. You can send out crew on away missions, once you hit higher levels and become an Admiral you can send out ships you originally commanded on missions, you can go mining for dilithium, pick up daily missions, work on your reputation with different factions, patrol worlds that aren't even part of a quest, or even play content created by other players and deemed good enough to be placed in-game. If I were to compare this to AAA titles like World of WarCraft I would have to give it and advantage in the sheer number of things you can do to keep the game feeling fun.  Gameplay works very well, especially in space. The ships handle like they should, the weapons are exactly the way they should be, and the powers all seem like they have a place. The graphics are very high-end but can be edited around so you can run the game on lower-tier systems.  I would be amiss if I didn't mention the best part of this game, and that is customization. Hair, facial structure, species, body proportions are all fully customizable, especially if you choose to make a custom alien species! Uniforms are available from every single era of Star Trek including the future uniforms and alternate universe uniforms if you want to spend a couple bucks. You are able to command every single starship made popular by the Star Trek series, from the original Enterprise to the USS Defiant. Some special ships are available as well which only appeared in a single episode like the Prometheus-Class, or the Dauntless. Variations on ships are available as well like the Saratoga version of the Miranda-Class seen in the first episode of Deep Space Nine. A painstaking amount of effort was made to allow players to utilize any ship they wanted, even having ways of using a Constitution Class in the end-game. Of course, when you see the ships designed by the STO team as Starfleets newest vessels you may not want to bother with the original ships since the new designs are exemplary. Most of these ships act as updated versions of earlier ships like the Resolute-Class being a modern overhaul of the Excelsior-Class. There are a few which are completely unique and its obvious the team loves Star Trek because they are faithful to Star Trek while still looking suitably advanced.   Ship Equipment is another way you can customize this game. Their are numerous weapon styles based on the ones seen in the series. Phasers, Disruptors, Plasma, Tetryon, and many more different forms of weaponry all pertaining to even the more obscure species, plus combinations of these different types and special weapons you find along the way, like the Klingon ""Hargh'peng"" Doomsday Weapon killing torpedo. Almost every part of your ship can be upgraded and enhanced, sometimes with interesting visual effects on the ship which can be turned on or off.  I mentioned the crew before but a quick blurb on them is appropriate since they are also completely customizable. You may not get what you want at the start but over time of finding bridge officers and customizing them you eventually will have a ship full of characters you designed yourself, in the positions you want them in.  If my massive gush-fest wasn't enough to say so: In this game, if you cannot find a combination of uniform/ship/crew that makes you happy, you either aren't looking hard enough or you aren't really interested in Star Trek.  The sound is all spot on and its fun to play a captain from the 'Original Series' era because a lot of the effects and sounds are replaced to reflect the more classic style. Much effort has been made to make sure the immersion is perfect, with little touches like the Klingons, Federation, and Romulans having different transport effects. Overall, the attention to detail is impressive and helps make the whole game feel polished. It doesn't hurt that they keep pulling in cast members from the series to voice act their characters in-game. Characters like Geordi La Forge, Worf, the Doctor, Seven of Nine, and numerous others all make an appearance, reprised by their respective actors. It all helps make the game feel that much more authentic.  ON THE OTHER HAND!   Star Trek Online's theme song is suitably heroic and sounds sufficiently 'Star Trek' but the few other songs in the game tend to repeat, making it a little annoying after a while of hearing the same song from Vulcan playing while you are fighting Borg on a damaged Cube. So the music is a low point in this game.   Additionally there are still some graphical glitches that come up, and the ground combat is generally annoying. It is still a sight better then when the game first came out but its like upgrading from a Shark latched onto your leg to a Piranha latched onto your butt. One isn't quite as bad as the other but its still not very pleasent.  There are micro-transactions which can be used to purchase additional ships, appearances, crew members, officers, etc. If you don't mind a little hard work you can get the micro-transaction currency through the in-game resource 'Dilithium'. Not that you really need to buy additional customization because there is already so many options its mind-boggling. While I am not too worried about the transactions I know many people don't like them. Pricing can be pretty varried. This may have something to do with the Dilithium system and the team not wanting to make it easy to get entire ships through in-game grinding, but it can be annoying at times. Entire costume packs consisting of numerous extra appearance options can cost a very reasonable $5.50 USD, but a top-tier ship (T6) generally costs $30.00 USD which can get really pricy. Thankfully once you get one T6 ship you generally are set to go on ships for the forseeable future, you just have to start with upgrading the ship equipment.  In conclusion, it's a fantastic MMORPG that keeps getting updates and keeps getting better. If you are a Star Trek fan and want to command your own ship there is no reason to not play this at least a bit.",Thu Jun 11 15:36:24 EEST 2020,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

It's nothing more than a cash-grabbing MMO which is feeding off of Trek fans that have no other game to play. These people will say you don't need to spend money but you do when you get to end game. End game is nothing more than grinding a lame rep.system until a new episode comes out. And with every expansion comes a new rep.system to grind. Now CBS is forcing them to add Discovery content to help push this new Trek show which is a failure. This is what you have to look forward to in the game.

I downloaded this game (after ages of being put off of it's 10GB installer, which is a valid reason I feel with terrible download speeds) and my word, I could not be more disapointed. I had hoped for another Bridge Commander with a few ""Mass Effect-equse"" battles. In reality, the ground combat is just awful, essentially pre Mass Efffect 1 combat, and we all know how bad that is. The space combat is similar to Bridge Commander, but nowhere near as fluid. The quests are literally pointless and only serve as a use to tell you to get around the very vast galaxy. The first few minutes are just laughable, the plot is completely unrealistic, even in a Sci-fi world. Sadly, the point I wanted to get to, PVP, with massive PEW PEW PEW space battles, wasn't obtainable. As you have to be a certain level to even have a hope of joining a lobby and then being able to actually survive the Pay-2-Win. Why on Earth they didn't just remake Bridge Commander I have no idea. That right there is a gold mine. After 6 hours of play, I could take no more and freed up some space on my HDD. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it just feels so outdated and unnatural to play.

While the game was far from perfect, the community nonetheless basked in the distinct Russian flavour of the setting, characters, and outlook represented in its post-apocalyptic world, passionately adapted from [i]Dmitry Glukhovsky’s[/i] novel of the same title.\n\n\tIn [i]Metro[/i], the metaphorical strife of humanity against its darker, self-destructive nature were often presented in true, unyielding gritty terms. Depictions of huddled humanity striving against the desolation of the new world, not for survival but for the basic sense of normality and security were disturbingly overlaid with images of violent fanaticism and unforgiving death. Death by the creatures of the new world and by left and right winged fanatics.\n\n\tAs a highly cinematic game, based on a series of novels, [i]Metro: Last Light's[/i] meat is in the story. Almost the entirety of my commendation for this franchise originates from the story-driven experience, so discussing the way in which the story is told seems like the most appropriate place to start. The game prioritizes on the human experience as the lead method of story telling, making it a unique and enriching experience. From the very beginning in which the series’ protagonist, Artyom, awakens to his call to adventure, it is abundantly clear that an intricate level of attention has been dedicated to detail that could only hope to be achieved by a group of developers with a genuine love for their subject matter. Extremely excessive yet altogether human interactions, like the ability to play your musical instruments, or turn off the room lights before moving out, build a sense of empathy by allowing the player to project very normal impulses onto the first person perspective. Every time you find yourself in a surviving human settlement, there are a myriad of opportunity to take a break from the violent chaos of the unforgiving new world and listen to the personal stories and woes of the Metro survivors; All told in richly voiced and detailed animated discussions. These little things add depth and immersion to [i]Metro: Last Light[/i], all the while giving an insight of the life in the Metro. Even when you are out on your own traversing the wastelands, the bulk of the game’s survival mechanics are built around an immersive sense of physicality. For example, players will need to manually replace their gas mask filters, charging their kinetic powered torch light by using a pump and wipe dirt and mud from their visor.\n\n\tThe rich and detailed story is well accompanied by the breathtaking beauty of the game's graphics engine and art. The level of gaming design provides an ultra-realistic environment gives the player the added advantage of situational awareness. For example, tracking enemy numbers and movement by merely observing the shadows cast on the walls. Players will be able to traverse the underground Metro stations, both surviving human settlements and settlements which did not survive an attack by the creatures of the new world. Players will also be able to witness the quaint, post-apocalyptic beauty of the nuclear wasteland of what once was Moscow, the Red Square and Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\n\tThe gameplay is fairly straight forward and linear. The linearity of the game is well executed as it stays focussed on the story and tasks at hand, not deviating too much from the imperative nature of Artyom's mission. However, the game does allow room for exploration and rewards you for doing so. Such rewards include ammo, gas mask filters, and even new weapons. The combat system is very interesting because you are given a choice in play style. One way to play it is like a typical modern shooter with guns blazing. A ton of arsenal is still at your disposal. From the pre-apocalypse Kalashnikov rifles, to Metro engineered shotguns and submachine guns. The game also allows weapons customization like adding silencers, laser sights and weapons optics. However, it should be noted that ammo is very scarce in the Metro, so tactical approaches to any combat situations are a must, adding another level of realism into the game. Another way to play it is by sticking to the shadows like a ghost as you pass through enemy settlements. This is the way I recommend playing the game because it will grant you more instances to stop and listen to the characters' stories and gain further insights to life in the Metro. It will grant you a heightened sense of satisfaction and accomplishment at the end of your journey, should you choose to play it this way. However, there will be instances where you cannot sneak past the enemies, but this is where it gets interesting, because you are given to choice to either slit the enemy's throat or just knock him out. Do you think there is already enough death and suffering in the Metro? Or do you think the wicked should be cleansed from the new world? The choice is entirely up to the player.\n\n\t[i]Metro: Last Light[/i] possesses a wealth of passion for its subject matter that is promising for the future of [i]4A Games[/i]. Playing it is like reading a book, written in the first person, where the author uses incredible and poetic descriptive language for every little thing that the protagonist encounters. In a world that is filled with misery and death, it is up to the player to decide if Artyom should add more misery and death to the world, or to salvage the last remnants of good in the wreckage of humanity. [i]Metro: Last Light[/i] does not want players to just enjoy the combat (or stealth), but also to learn something, to feel something out of it. What you ask? I think it wants us to question the human condition and ponder about the value and meaning of our lives before we inevitably succumb to our destructive nature.""",Mon Mar 29 01:49:26 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Each method is rewarding, and I found myself using each of them depending on the situation.  \nI could go on about this game endlessly, but the main thing is that you'll need a powerful gaming PC to enjoy this how it's meant to be experienced.  If you don't have enthusiast hardware, I definitely don't recommend because it's just going to lag and ruin the atmosphere.  This needs at the minimum a GTX 670 or AMD 7950, the system requirements they posted are laughable.""",Fri Oct 29 05:51:05 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

Infact so much its not only unworthy of carrying the name Star Trek But Its got way to many issues that need desperate fixing.First off anyone thats getting connection issues. I agree That means Connection issues with some of the servers like the account server need to be resolved.Secondly Any maintanence ect. Shard maintanence being done needs more clear posting and further more Why do such a thing with the server up. Take the server down if your gonna do Maitanence damnit.And finaly whoever says this game needs a new Engine. They are right This game is in desperate need of a new engine and badly.Bottom line Cryptic you have let me down and a few other users down with your handling of this game you damn basterds.,Fri Sep 04 17:40:00 EEST 2020,1b23b150-edc4-456a-a52d-fbd499770cbb

It's heaven for theorycrafters. Every so often however, Cryptic might release a new skill or item that makes one type of build the flavour of the month and in one case it can shadow all other builds, which are left in the dust.That's always the risk in a game where every class can access virtually every skill.The game merges two types of gameplays, the ground combat and the space combat. They work and feel different and you are able to concentrate only on one if you don't like the other. While levelling you might need to do a little bit of both, so depending on your tastes it might be either welcome variety or a minor annoyance, until you get to end game and are completely able to pick what kind of content you want to play.The ability to walk around your ship and starbases also allows plenty of opportunities for RP if you are into that. Talking of which the character costumisation in this game is on par with games such as Aion, if not better. The graphic style is not Asian, but when you can pick things like the length of your fingers, you know you can do almost anything.The game isn't necessarily pay to win, although items from the Zen store do have their advantages. If you have the time to grind, you can exchange in game currency for Zen (which you can buy with real cash) but the process is considerably slower.Overall Star Trek Online is an underrated game which has kept me busy for way more hours than most other MMOs I have played.

88eab3a8-ce2e-43ae-b740-57302e4cca67,9,"Although the game is enjoyable, one first has to surpass a host of technical challenges and issues - most of which plague users after the game is installed. These include gameclient.exe errors, random crashes to desktop (without a report feature), crashes to desktop (which do trigger the report feature), disconnects, and memory leaks.In the 36 hours preceding this review, my client crashed out 23 times on an Asus 673JH-A1 with up-to-date drivers, making STO one of the buggiest games I've ever encountered. (This also takes the prize from Trion's ""Defiance,"" which gained quick post-launch notoriety for its bugs, glitches, and other game-breaking features.)Company technical support, or lack thereof, complicates the picture. Cryptic is known by this point as ""Chronic"" due to their persistent inability to launch a major patch without breaking at least one major feature - leading to at least 2-5 subsequent patches to fix whatever was originally broken. Technical support is also nonexistent, meaning you're on your own for troubleshooting and support.In short, definitely would not recommend this game.Update: After not playing the game for about 4 months, I reinstalled it on a whim and was promptly met by 3 crashes in an hour.

e5a55bc8-0531-4b2d-8dbe-e27f2b40e85f,3,"I have always loved Star Trek; and as such, that will tend to make my review biased. However, I think it is fair to say that I will lay down what I feel about this game in a rather fair form. For the longest time, there have not been many great attempts at recreating the Star Trek universe in a game. Some of the best Star Trek games I would argue; go back to the late 1990's and early 2000's; where Star Trek Armada, Klingon Academy, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force and Bridge Commander were some of the best titles. Later down the road; such as the mid to late 2000's, you had some titles but none were particularly worth playing. Star Trek Online comes around, and yes: The launch was dissapointing for many who expected it to be a in-depth Bridge Commander style game; not to mention other details seem to have went missing from the game. This is partially due to the collapse of Perpetual Entertainment and the acquisition and development over to Cryptic. The game originally was a monthly fee based game; but eventually it turned Free to Play. I played it for a while years ago but have since been convinced to pick it up and see how it is.I have to say, I am quite impressed with it. The game overall makes you feel like you are in charge of a ship and you even go under the sensation of living in the shoes of a captain; the amount of things to do and the quality of the mission narratives makes the game rather interesting and not so much a typical boring MMO. Pros:1. Free to Play system is fair. (There is purchase content, but it doesn't upset balance.)2. Customization galore. (Ships, uniforms, officers, loadouts, etc. Lots of cosmetic choices.)3. Solo friendly environment. (You don't need to be with others to succeed. You can team up; but the game doesn't require it.)4. Large Officer roster. (Bridge officers that can operate your ship's systems. Assign teams to go away on missions outside your ship.) 5. Space combat mechanics. (Want to focus shield energy on a given side? Want to increase power to weapons? You are in control.)6. Not a grindfest game. (Want to hit the level cap? This game doesn't make you spend countless hours of your life to get to that point.)7. Foundry missions. (User generated missions that have their own plot and objectives. They can vary in quality; but it is player freedom.)8. Star Trek MMO. (Star Trek fans like this. This is totally not obvious, right?)9. Mission types. (Not every mission involves combat or fighting, some are simple scan or repair missions.)10. Mission narrative. (Some missions make you think of yourself fulfilling the role in a Star Trek episode.)Cons:1. Player community. (It is a free to play game, so this is sort of expected. Players get too political sometimes and often immature. Sometimes it is difficult to make inquiries in chat, etc. Not everyone likes this kind of environment.)2. Enemy bosses. (This is more of a annoying trope than a real problem. Enemy bosses such as the ""villain"" type always seem to escape you.)3. Linear missions. (There are plenty of them that offer different solutions to a problem; but many missions don't have multiple outcomes.)4. Away team issues. (The away teams that you bring into combat will never try to revive you unless they are not fighting. Sometimes Away team members don't maintain unit coherency.)5. Some visuals. (Some planet textures on even the highest settings still look blocky and ugly.)6. Customer service. (The customer service is known to be on the poor side. Lack of sincerity and cooperation when issues arise in cases.)Overall, this MMO is definitely worth playing; even if you are not into Star Trek; the game itself is quite entertaining and full of things to do. There is a lot of purchase content; but it isn't required to actually succeed in playing and enjoying the game.",Sun Sep 19 00:08:41 EEST 2021,62a6899b-550d-45d7-b4cd-3329be85e915

Namely, I started playing it when it first launched (and it was a subscription based MMO). Cryptic did a good job, but to be honest, they launched it too early, and it felt like it was halfway done.  The Federation side had a good amount of content, but the Klingon faction, did not.  So after playing it for about a year, I took a break from it (a year plus break).  Coming back to it after so long, even after it went F2P and Cryptic was bought by Perfect World Entertainment, I must say, Cryptic has done an excellent job in expanding the universe.  Not only did they launch a third faction, the Romulans, they also fully fleshed out the Klingon faction.  They also updated the trait system, kit system, and R&D system, while continuing to create Featured Episodes.  That, along with a more robust Foundry (a system that let's the community create playable missions to share), I must say, I've gotten hooked on this game once again.",Sat Jan 08 10:23:58 EET 2022,35813a73-6674-4f54-a7ff-3ac4c122d581

And i have played since closed beta.)Overall quality of this game is bad. Ive been with this game since its beta and it was shipped unfinished to meet a contract deadline, they (the devs) admited this. Major problems from the beta are still present in the game now years later. devs barely update the game at all and when they do it normaly breaks it worse for a few months then it goes back to what it was before with like one spelling error fixed in one converation nobody reads anyway. The games ingame store makes the game pay to win, but all that money you are paying them they are not putting towards developing the game.  Feature episodes (their version of a tv show episode) which are kinda like mini events that move forwards the timel ine of the game and cost alot of dev time can most of the time out of a 6 weeks for 6 parts series be completed in 30 minutesabout 5 min for a part some of the parts are purely walls of text to read and complete in less then 2 min.Actual gameplay of this game is in a word repetative. Go here kill this. Go here collect this. Go here kill this to collect this. Completely missing the point of the story telling that was any of the TV shows, starfleet rarely uses lethal force or force at all to achieve there goals but thats all you do in this game. Once in a blue moon you come across an interesting quest line but most are sub par, literaly narrow hallways with the entrance on one end, 4 groups of enemies to kill and a conversation at the end. Time to max level in this game taeks about 4 to 6 weeks. Ground combat in this game is a joke it lacks anything to make it fun, boreing interiors for all but 6 missions. Space combat is not in much better shape but at least they spent time here usualy interesting looking locations but still repetative combat, enter mission - kill 4 groups - conversation - leave.Dev comepletely fail at understanding how to make a game. There are enemies in the game that have a 0% chance to miss you and deal 10 times your health and sheilds combined both in ground and space. This is to add ""challenge"" to the game when in reality they skimped out on making the game made it kill you so you would have to eather try again and hope you DPS it to death before it can react or you grind some repetative mission to crap xp to become higher level then the guy to go back through the whole mission again to kill him and continue the sub par story that you dont even remember why your in the same exact looking base killing another dude.While most of this game is complete crap they have at least done some interesting things to the cannon star trek story line and is at least worth playing for a month to get the story if your a star trek fan. And some of there latest content that last big update adding the delta quadrant is rather good story and gameplay wise they actualy broke there own molds for missions in this last update, the main enemy in these missions is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fight in space since it can one shot even the most tanky crusier you have with a massive nearly unavoidable AOE in space, but other then that its rather good. Also while this game is lacking in most areas it is a fun game to paly with friends. Also making your character in this game uses one of the best systems ive ever seen in a game you can control almost all aspects of your characters looks.

1cccc4db-db90-4478-8e24-f236a10461da,3,"First thing i want to add is, don't be fooled by my playtime, i actually have more than 5.000h of playtime in this, but steam for some reason refuses to count playtime for me except rarely.This would be an even more gigantic review if i touched everything that is wrong with the game, but i'll just stick with the issues that were added with the current expansion and are obviously driving people away from the game, and it will still be a long review, so be warned.This game used to be one the most casual, if not the most casual F2P MMO out there, it was forgiving and extremely fun, all this changed with the ""Delta Rising"" expansion, which turned the game into a grindfest, padded enemy HP to the point of hilarity and added forced countdowns in almost every new mission or queue in order to force you into taking a certain amount of time to complete stuff, it doesn't matter if you're extremely well geared or not, you'll have sit there and wait, and to boot on ""advanced content""(mid-tier content), they made ""optionals"" non-optional, if you fail them, mission failed, so if you're unlucky and some idiot in your team decides he wants to ruin it for everyone, he can do easily by shooting something he shouldn't or something like that, and this pretty much killed queued content which went from over 300-500 people playing at any time to around 20-30 at most, cryptic explicitly said they would keep advanced content as hard as the old elite(they promised it in fact), but they lied and increased the HP by 500%(later lowered to 400%, after months of complaining), meanwhile the new max gear tier will give you a 60% damage increase.They also nerfed exp gain across the board, and added ""specializations"" which in theory are supposed to be optional, but with the new ships(which use said specializations) and the fact they're incredibly good, it means you HAVE to get them, and they also take forever to get, since cryptic did everything in its power to make sure it does take a ridiculously long time(if you try to get them playing normally, you'll be lucky to get a single point in a week, which would take years of playtime to complete it all, and in 8 months they released a completely new one and expanded a previous one, and have clear intentions to release more, let that sink in for a bit).They also released a new tier of ships completely turning the previous end-game ships, obsolete(we're talking about $25 ships here), now before you say ""every RPG releases new stuff that makes old content obsolete"" remember this, STO isn't a regular MMO, your ship IS you, your player character only really matters on ground combat which isn't the focus of STO, on space all you get are ""captain"" abilities and some minor traits(think of them as minor passive buffs), most of your space abilities come from your officers and some consoles which can be equipped in ships. now some will tell you that the new tier doesn't actually makes the previous one obsolete since you can ""upgrade"" ships of the old final tier(some cryptic herself said), this is a lie for the following reasons(with one single exception):1 - The new tier still has another extra skill slot for your bridge officers(this is very important), the upgrade on the old ships doesn't give them a new slot.2 - The new ships have ""traits"", some of which are hilariously p2w, but the most obvious one is ""all hands on deck of the tactical version of the command battlecruisers(across all 3 factions) which to keep things short, allows you basically cut down your captain abilities cooldown by almost 50%, if you're a tactical captain(which are already the best type), you have 3 DAMAGE buffs, 1 targeted resistance debuff and another ability that gives you cooldown reduction on all your tactical abilities right down to their global cooldown(see where this is going?), just to give an example you'll be able to use your main captain ability(attack pattern alpha = +50% damage) every 45 secs , instead of every 1min and 30 seconds(it lasts 30 seconds...). You don't need to actually use the said ship to use the trait, all you need is to buy it, then ""level"" the ship(which is quite fast if go somewhere where you can destroy many ships).3 - Every new ship can use one of the specializations(atm there are intelligence(incredibly strong), command and pilot), the old ones can't, and cryptic made it clear they never will be capable of using it, in other words if you're using old ships, you're locked out of new game content, isn't it amazing?Now for that exception, there is a ship called the scimitar, which is by far the best ship in the game due to the sheer amount of damage you can dish with it(which is kinda fair, since it was OP in the movies too), but make no mistake, cryptic has made it clear they intent on releasing every old iconic ship as a tier 6 version, so you can re-buy everything again(isn't it nice?), so its a matter of time till they re-release the scimitar.Cryptic also added ""crafting"" which is basically RNG-based gambling so you can get a weapon with the mods you wish, you also need to use it if you want take your weapon to highest tier, which is VERY costly, even more so if you're trying to get them to increase in rarity(unless you happen to be a bored billionaire from dubai or something, don't try to increase rarity, its stupid).So to summarize, cryptic took a game with a booming population, which had a very casual, forgiving and fun playstyle, and turned into a boring grindfest, outright lied to the playerbase, and refuse to fix it, even though the population continues to drop as a direct result of said changes. Cryptic has been trying desperately to reverse this by doing everything BUT reversing/improving on what they did, its not working and it will not work, because in the end, the game is still boring.My recommendation? stay the hell away from this thing, if you insist on playing this trainwreck, be a romulan tactical captain aligned with the klingons, get a scimitar and the 1000 zen nausicaan ship of the klingon side, it will give you the best console in the game, the plasmonic leech, you don't need anything else.I'll change this review if cryptic fixes those issues... which i seriously doubt will happen.",Wed Oct 21 15:43:51 EEST 2020,35813a73-6674-4f54-a7ff-3ac4c122d581

Considering i don't like dystopian futuristic settings in any medium be it movies, novels or video games, the devs deserve credit for pulling off a big feat here. The world they created is so realistic and so are its problems, you can look at the present world and this fictional future and it looks totally believable and relative to our own problems nowadays.\nWhen it comes to gameplay. Stealth, this is as good as it gets, to put it simply there are so many ways to approach a situation that every one can have their cup of tea.\nThis particular game has pretty short main campaign but the amount of side content makes up for it in my opinion. Which also in my opinion belongs to 'highest quality side content' section of RPG rankings. The side quests perfectly fit in the world and the conflicts that the main campaign is dealing with seamlessly. The characters are so well written and unique, the writing overall is pretty good.

7180e82a-b6cd-4004-97c9-1a711ecd91c7,9,"""The great sequel to one of the finest linear shooters I've ever played.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is \""better\"" than in the previous title, but some of the polish feels unnecessary and detracts from the feel of the game. It's also signficantly easier than 2033, even on Ranger mode.\n\nFor example, the gunplay feels far smoother this time around. More... modern. While I can see why the developers took this route, it does make the shooting a bit generic. It's still fun, but doesn't have the impact 2033 did: Last Light's gunplay feels closer to modern military shooters than STALKER. \n\nThere's even more emphasis on stealth and sneaking around than in the previous game, but this part has the same problem the shooting does. Actually getting detected takes a bit of effort: the visibility indicator only has two \""modes\"" now: completely invisible and 'kind of' visible. The silliest thing is that most of the areas in this game aren't actually dark at all. You can, quite literally, sneak 50cm in front of a guy in a room parially lit by sunlight! As long you're not directly lit by a lamp or something, you're effectively invisible. If you somehow manage to screw up and end up 'visible' in front of an enemy, there's at least a 2-second period between \""Did I see something?\"" and \""Open fire!\"", which easily lets the player hide again. The AI forgets everything within a few seconds and resets back to the patrol path.\n\nOne nice addition to the stealth system is the lethal and non-lethal takedowns. Actually choosing which ones you employ is mostly irrelevant: the AI never reacts to either the 'What the hell?'s or screams. In some parts of the game, you may earn moral points (for getting the 'good' ending) by sparing enemies, but other than that, there's no difference whatsoever between murdering everyone with a knife or punching  everyone in the face. Better system than the seemingly random knife killing in 2033.\n\nThe gas mask filter mechanic is mostly irrelevant in Last Light. There's absolutely no way anyone could ever run out of filter time, even on Ranger mode's cut down supply spawns. The system itself makes much more sense this time, with a more obvious timer for individual filters and the total time of all filters combined. Nice, but as I said, filters are never an issue in Last Light, so the improvements are a bit of waste.\n\nEnemy variety is far greater this time. Instead of 2033's running monster, flying monster and Russian guy with a gun, there are now several distinct variants of the basic 'rat' monsters, huge spiders that can only be killed by frying them with a light source, armoured Russian guy and large shrimp-like mutants, in addition to the old enemies. \n\nAll the mutant types also have a larger boss version. Sounds cool, but the boss mechanics are all absolutely identical:\n1. Boss attacks you, small cutscene.\n2. Run away from boss in large arena.\n3. Stun boss by shooting in the face or having it charge into a wall.\n4. Shoot.\nThis is how all the mutant boss fights go. Not very exciting at all.\n\nThe absolute biggest improvement is found in storytelling and character interaction. This time, the storyline is more about the people of the Metro, instead of an outside threat. All the important characters now have unique faces and clothing, and actual story arcs! A massive improvement overall, but there is one character whose story feels totally out of place and random (Anna). The main storyline picks up from 2033's default (bad) ending, and focuses on the conflicts of the various groups in the Metro. While storytelling is improved, I personally prefer 2033's actual storyline, as it has more of a philosophical aspect to it, instead of \""just\"" a three-way conflict between the Red Line, the Reich and Sparta / Polis.\n\nLast Light has the best graphics I've ever seen in a video game. A relatively small improvement over 2033's graphics, and an absolutely massive improvement in optimization: solid 60fps at high settings on my piece of shit PC is quite impressive.\nAudio is mostly the same as in 2033, except for dialogue, which sounds much clearer this time. \n\nSo, this ended up mostly being a comparison between LL and 2033. Whatever. Will add thoughts on DLC once I've finished them all.\n\nGreat game, better than 2013's other big shooter, Bioshock Infinite, but not as good as Metro2033.""",Fri Sep 17 00:55:49 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

This was a top tier player filming his play on Javelin-4 , I watched them shoot someone in the KNEE while this person jumped and it registered as a HEADSHOT!!!!!! It was so far off I couldn't believe it. I watched it 6 times to see if this was correct. It definitely was. 2) Peak shooting also allows them to be the SAFEST main in the game. You can be exposed for a brief split second to fire. Then once you hit you do SO MUCH damage per bullet!!! This combined with the serious grading curve of headshots, is where bungie HELPS this architype. A real weapon of any kind to the head would be a death sentence. Bungie lowers damage of most architypes, but kept more of the stopping power of some. Hand Cannons have more per bullet, when really all weapons should kill almost NEVER survive a shot to the head. They do this is all while having a REDICULOUS handicap to aim. There are a lot of people considered great players in this game with great movement, but mediocre accuracy walking tall with a strong headshot average. A great many of them can't actually aim for shit, but destiny helps that along. I would laugh to watch them in just about any other FPS... 3) Hand cannons have competitive range compared to most other architypes, with great in air accuracy because of the firing style and the damage per round. Even keeping up with longer range rifles. That crap is almost laughably inaccurate... all the way around. I know, it's fantasy so what... blah blah blah. It's hard to take it seriously... It really is, or put any weight to the skill of aiming in this game with that crap. Its a lot harder to stay alive when only one ACTUAL shot to the head kills you, and also easier to stay alive when a bullet 2 feet from your head doesn't hit you when it shouldn't. Maybe the \""dad\"" rifle hitting you in the head 8 times kills you the 1st round, and then all of a sudden a hand cannon is not so luxurious or a status symbol. It becomes the liability it really is. Otherwise elite fighting forces would start carrying large caliber pistols into battle instead of the HK MP7a1 sub machine gun fitted with suppressor that killed Bin Laden. Just a thought.... Don't get me started on sniper weapons being pulled out and aimed down scope (dialed in and everything) quicker that a real person could pull out a small sidearm....

The crafting system is fun and also the Officer missions. You can send your crew to get recources for you or even different currencies you can spend for equipment. The stories are really cool and I can recommend the Missions which take you back in time to experience old star trek episodes. I recently joined again to see what changed. They implemented a lot of new features, quests and events so a PvE player might be very satisfied BUT if you are looking for PvP you should look elsewhere. The entire game changed from different fighting factions to a bunch of excel sheet reading damage maximizing grannys in pink pyjamas. They only maximize their gear to get better gear and to sit in their space stations dreaming of big fights which will never happen as nobody ever plays any PvP. So if you look for a complex game with seasonal events and story you are at the right place but you will never use your gear in player combat ever again.

Before this, grinding used to be interesting with decent rewards for your efforts. Now, it feels like you're working, yes WORKING, to not fall behind. A game should be for fun. It is suppose to be entertaining. This game has been dragged down from its former days of fundom into a true 2nd job. The only thing this software seems to want to achieve is to get the most amount of money from the player as it possibly can. I've tried to enjoy this title. I've put well over 2k hours into this thing.

The main issue I have with the game is the ""power creep"" added to late game content and how some items and ships are clearly more powerful than any other alternatives, especially the content that free players have access to. The base game is fun, and worth exploring if you are a Star Trek fan but as you progress to end game more and more of the content will be locked behind a paywal till eventually your reach a point where you will be simply inferior to someone who has dropped cash, from a little to a lot, to improve his or her ship or crew. Through the various systems in the cash shop you can directly buy power in-game. You still have to level to use this content, but the paid cash shop content is clearly superior than anything any free player has access to, some of the rarer, more expensive shops OP to the point of imbalance.",Thu Jul 29 09:24:00 EEST 2021,35813a73-6674-4f54-a7ff-3ac4c122d581
f6a48035-9930-4dd5-ba12-f67295fd6b07,7,"This game has become a bugfest. There are bugs almost everywhere in the game. The developers don't care about fixing them. They turn a blind eye to feedback from the playerbase. On the forums topics are being locked that provide negative feedback about the game. They only focuss on filling their own wallet's. They keep adding broken content and the amount of bugs keeps getting bigger. They fix 1 bug? 10 new bugs appear to replace the one they fixed. Their hardware is crap. Everyone gets disconnected from the game every few hours due to ""server not responding"". Yet the developers keep saying everything is working as intended and that the problem always lies on the side of the customers.The 5 year anniversary is the latest example of Cryptic's incompetence. The first 48 hours after the 5 year anniversary launch the game was unplayable because of the high amount of players logging into the game at the same time. What was the developer team's response? They told us to wait 2-3 days until everyone has finished patching their clients. Yet again this new content is filled with bugs and some of it isn't even playable because missions can't be completed.I have never, ever seen an MMO go downhill as badly as Star Trek Online. MMO's are supposed to be stable due to the high amount of players playing the game. But with Cryptic? With them: ""everything is working as intended"". I'm a big fan of Star Trek, and this game is the closest thing a Star Trek fan can have to an MMO representing the Star Trek universe.

Minor gripes appear rarely as I experienced this thrill ride all game developers need to be jealous of. \n\nIt's easy to feel immersed in the level design, and to build an immediate connection with the narrative woven throughout. Explore the radioactive surface of a war torned Russia, finding filters to survive, but turn around only to see two mutants staring at you, drooling with hunger. Have a guard stumble upon your wheels, and kill him upon surprise, with a knife to the head. Take on new enemy types as you progress through catacombs, swamps, and a moving train. And all the while making moral choices, and understanding your world, to decide the fate of the Metro.\n\nLast Light offers a few glimpses of real scarcity in it's survival with more than enough filters to breath. There are off the path moments of chilling horror with mysterious happenings that, in retrospect, appear cliche and out of place underneath the reign of fire atmosphere. Forgivable interfaces for purchasing weapon customizations are forgotten as well once you return to the action. \n\nAnd that action is usually of your choice. Choose to be a pacifist, a panther, or a hunter. For me it was satisfying to try as many different approaches as possible to liven up the gameplay as it did have moments of repetition - necessary as they may have been for the story. Those choices were leading me to an uncertain conclusion as to what ending I would achieve. \n \nYet, there is one thing that is certain. Last Light, like its predessecor, is always going to be on sale for a great price during Steam Sales. And that is a steal for what you get in return. Everything about this game communicates a front to back care for the finest of details. Personally, this is a game that sets the bar high for the first person shooter genre, and must be a call to action to studios. Envy this, and try to do better. Metro: Last Light is one hell of a ride. 9/10""",Fri Apr 30 12:12:31 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

55892cca-d503-46f3-acab-f31820000a3f,2,"What I liked about STO (Star Trek Online) is impossible to say. After all, I never got that far because tech support was unable to answer a simple query concerning which domains to whitelist (other than perfectworld.com) in order to get it running on a secure system. Let's start from the beginning:.My system is specially set up so that JavaScript, etc.,  runs correctly on my system only when served from a whitelisted domain. From any other domain it gets shut down - which is how I know that STO is served, in part, from unspecified domains other than perfectworld.com and these other domains are, consequently, not whitelisted by my security. .What takes the cake is that, when I asked tech support for the domain names which needed to be whitelisted for the game to work, they responded by stating that the game works for “millions” of other people - which dodged the question by employing an argument by irrelevance; a form of sophistry known as a fallacy. I have to wonder if these guys even bothered to read the support ticket I lodged (given their total failure to comprehend the problem I raised) and why they couldn't simply address my question (as opposed to addressing some purely imaginary complaint).  .Now, when support techs start engaging in sophistry, it can mean that they are more interested in griefing the customers than doing their job. Moreover, this reflects very poorly on management, for obvious reasons; principally because it demonstrates the attitude that they can do no wrong and it is always someone-else's fault which, ultimately, gives rise to a fundamental disrespect for the customer base..The bottom line is that I recommend strongly against STO and, moreover, I will not be reviewing this game again until I see some sort of evidence that key management changes have been made which facilitate policy implementation designed to ensure that customers are not systematically marginalised for the apparent crime of asking for some technical support.",Sun Aug 15 07:32:54 EEST 2021,933ce176-da2c-41d5-b9d5-92a1b48b036f

What I'm talking about here is when the screen transitions from one scene into another it doesn't allow all of the entities to load before coming in from black. So you're frequently left watching strange pop-in with stuff. There are also numerous control-specific things that just feel... off... like clicking over and over to attack, instead of being able to just hold down the button, to give one example.

f0b478a3-fa54-4eb7-878a-fbe157a32a54,9,"""[b] A good game, but not a worthy sequel.[/b]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]RATING:[/th]\n        [th]🌟🌟🌟 3/5[/th]\n[th]AVERAGE GAME[/th]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n[h1]Context[/h1]\nAfter playing Deux Ex: Human Revolution (DXHR) and genuinely falling in love with it, I immediately bought Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (DXMD) expecting more of that universe. Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Mon Nov 08 23:25:52 EET 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

The loyal member, Arthur Morgan, begins taking on the hardships garnering enough needs for the gang to live in peace. You, as the player, will take on his role to lead his fate as the world reflects from his actions.\n\n[i]Red Dead Redemption 2[/i] is the first game that offers a glimpse of what immersive open world games could be in the new/current generation.

I may be wrong, but the way they handled its open world is quite straightforward yet feels like too much sweat and tears were shed just to make the vast and wide world of Red Dead feel alive. Take note that this review pretty much focuses on the singleplayer campaign aspect.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\n\n[list][*]⭐ There’s nothing new about the story’s [b]Plot[/b] that we may consider record breaking imo. The execution alone is what makes it perfect. The game doesn’t seem to hold back too much on resources for them to make a blockbuster story. It even manages to have a completely different island just for one chapter despite how huge the main map is.\n\n[*]⭐ There are tons of [b]Content[/b] in the story as to which I sunk around 80+ hours before I actually reach the credits. The game is like a 40+ min/ep TV series you would binge because it has a nice blend of cinematography with a long story split into different parts.\n\n[*]⭐ Each [b]Missions[/b] are properly split per major plot point as the usual Rockstar open world games do except these sets of missions are organized by chapter which helps the player know when’s the time to fool around in the game and do side missions before proceeding to the main story. The side missions are something I wouldn’t guarantee skipping as it helps build up the development of the main character. I honestly think bounty hunting missions, gang honor missions, and only some ‘unique encounter’ missions are the only ones that feel optional.\n[/list]\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\n\n[list][*]⭐ Some may back out on how [i]RDR2[/i]’s [b]Exploration[/b] works as most of the time, players will be riding on a horse. Even if fast travelling exists, we’re only allowed to do so in major towns, cities, or settlements which are generally far apart. What makes exploration fun is how common scripted events are. There’s so many unique encounters in this game that my fingers, toes, and eyelashes can’t count.  I wouldn’t spoil all the them, but one memorable experience was when I saw a horse with a wagon moving on the road, and as it approaches to my character’s side, there’s a corpse of a driver leaning his head downwards with a lot of arrows on his back which was a great introduction to an infamous gang in the late game. All in all, It comes down to personal preference rather than criticism.\n\n[*]⭐ The [b]Controls[/b] are polished to a point that there are hardly any conflicting inputs that would let the character do a different action on a couple of nearby interactables. It may be counterintuitive at first just like in old [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] games, but it’ll soon make sense where it begins to fit like a glove.\n\n[*]⭐ There’s hardly anything innovative about the [b]Combat[/b] besides it being so well done. The flow of the fights was improved compared to the first game as close quarters combat has more fluidity and more executions.\n\n[*]⭐ I would have skipped the topic about [b]Immersion[/b] if it weren’t for hunting and skinning animals for food and profit, doing home chores, gun cleaning, camping, cooking, bathing, eating, drinking, sleeping, hitchhiking, opening doors, opening two-sided doors, getting your hat shot by an enemy which flew away from your head and then being able to pick it up where it literally landed, perhaps also how a gun gets a different animation the longer you use it as the main character gets better at it, and maybe even how the main character has his own dialogue at a dog when he’s drunk… yet here we are.[/list]\n\n[b]AESTHETICS[/b]\n\n[list][*]⭐ There’s no mistaking how amazing the [b]Graphics[/b] are, but it definitely shows its age of the Pre-PS5 era. What makes it jaw-dropping are the amount of scripted animations applied on everyone as it shows characters and NPCs acting as realistically as possible. I could even write a school report of an analysis of the horse’s details alone. It makes horses from other games look like an animatronic.\n\n[*]⭐ Rockstar did well with the [b]Voice, Audio and Music[/b]. The voice actors/actresses perfectly portray their characters with emotions especially the main character. I like how the music only kicks in during horse riding or when a major plot point occurs. Each major scene has its own soundtrack which makes it memorable. Other than that, the audio quality is overall decent and nothing groundbreaking as it is common to most modern games.[/list]\n\nThus, the verdict is an overall…\n[h1]10 headshots out of 10[/h1]\n\nRockstar really hit every mark in this game for me, arguably their best singleplayer yet.

e4e8c012-27e3-4b6a-871f-2e12d206af80,2,I came to this game back on the free to play launch.  I for the most part played nightly up until a year to two ago.  While the game is a great game one of the biggest down sides that caused me to stop playing the game is the constant grind to level up just so you can play the next story driven mission.  Sure it is easy to level up but it just gets old doing the same thing over and over again just to get to some new content.  The game when I came to it wasnt too bad but with the release of the fleet bases the game became a very huge dilithium sink which is now starting to level off some as dilithium values have dropped as majority of people have already finished their bases.I do recommend this game because you can put many hours in it but be warned you will have to do a grind to get to some stories as the story missions do not provide enough XP to level up from one story to the next.,Sat Jan 08 20:09:39 EET 2022,35813a73-6674-4f54-a7ff-3ac4c122d581

6c1a7b0d-73f4-454b-b275-3eda9bd6566e,8,"-As of November 21st of 2015, this review is woefully outdated. Be aware-Actually one of the more decent MMOs I've played. Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",Sun Jan 09 06:53:03 EET 2022,5088cebb-6778-447c-b53c-bc9ae8efbf8f

So it stands to reason that the first of two story add-ons to [i]Half-Life 2[/i] are also great FPS games. [i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections.

It also ties up some loose ends and explains things that were unclear in the franchise e.g. the Temporal Cold War or the Iconians.

I still frequently play bot matches or zombies, sometimes with friends, but there is zero online presence now. Even if it was still popular online, it's not worth anything near $60. This game is over nine years old now. There are probably kids younger than this game playing Call of Duty and we're still expected to pay full price for it? This game is worth an absolute max of $30, probably less, and the DLC's need steep discounts too. It is quite literally impossible to enjoy 100% of this game without online play, so why are we still paying 100% of the original price? Activision would almost certainly profit more if they slashed the prices of old CoD games.

fc26556a-5896-4d4f-a892-522a98ef95cb,1,"Space, the final frontier, isn't it...? No, the real frontier awaiting exploration is the vast array of choices you can make, from designing a ship & character, to changing your destined route through different verbiage or a vernacular of missions peering through an almost unveiled veneer of polished textures on older models.Now, to start the real review it goes without mentioning that the user interface is hectic and as a UI designer I would love to be part of the team that built it so I can fix foolish placement and bad design. Not being an option the next best route is the tutorial, which explains the nuances displayed by most of the engine, leaving your curiosity to work out the quirks without making the player feel dumb. One piece of the game that is certainly lacking though is the ship combat controls which can be hard to maneuver when there is more than one enemy, having to disengage and focus on fighting but move far enough away as not to be affected by the blast of a destroyed enemy vessel.I would like to see this game receive a new launcher, some improvements to its UI, and polished cut scenes made on the current version of the engine before it receives an overtly high score, but I feel it's deserving of something above the middle ground as not only does this game try to draw you in, holding you hostage in tense battles for hours at a time, but it also returns a nostalgic feeling, one I last felt on the launch of Old School Runescape and a feeling I long to continue experiencing as I delve full time fervently further into the fabric of ths formerly forecasted foothold, frequented by funny but frustrated friendly men seemingly of fraternity fraudulentity.

I'm not one that really does the whole grouping and playing with others online and I don't belong to a guild or anything but even playing it as a single-player game is fine. Every now and then I may join a group mission and take on the Borg or what have you but the choice of races (Federation, Klingon, and Romulan) and different starting stories are really well done. Some missions seem to cross-over to the different races but there are some unique missions for each race as well. If you are a fan of any of the television series' then there is something here for you as all are respresented: TOS,TNG,DS9,VOY,ENT and that is a good thing. The gameplay is darn good and it look nice at max settings but nothing to compete with AAA titles. The ground misisons are fun and the space battles are awesome. The misisons are set about like episodes from the television series and there seems to be so much to do and there is variation depending on your race.You can upgrade your ships and get better ships as well  as your equipment for ground based misisons. I think if the game had a little more polish on the UI and the graphics/animation department this could be in the running to be the best MMORPG out there but as it is F2P you really should give it a shot.

The combat is fluent and the dialogue is near-perfect.However, there are only two things wrong, small things, but non the less they are essential. The frist point being my character has no voice and for such a star studded audio presentation it deterierates into laughable situations where it's a very serious moment, everybody panicing and there's me, stood there, emotionless and voiceless.My second and final complaint it the ship.

ca650dd8-7f00-4fca-ac99-454886021ea8,10,"STO has been my game of choice since participating in the closed beta. Though it suffered from a difficult start and bumps along the way, the game has continued to evolve and grow. The PvE aspect of the game has become expansive and can seem a bit overwhelming at times for new players. With so many systems integrated over the years from Duty officer missions and abilities, Reputations systems, countless gearsets/combinations, greatly improved crafting system finally in place, and of course the missions both official and player created, the game feels mostly complete and whole finally. Like any MMO it will continue to evolve and not always in a direction everyone will be happy with. That said the Development team generally gets it right. The free to play aspect is among the best I have encountered in all my thirty years as a gamer and the last ten or so with my encounters with free to play models. There are items a player would need to purchase for endgame such as ship upgrade tokens, fleet modules, and a removal of the energy credit cap. All items mentioned can be purchased with either cashy money or in game dillithium converted to game currency through the dillithium exchange. Now for the bad. The PvP is woefully lacking in improvement and attention since launch. While it can be entertaining the public qeues are so one sided and have been since a few months after launch. Abilities are often unblanaced to a fault. Often you are stuck with either the cookie cutter flavor of the month builds, abilites, Duty officer combinations. Even if you have a great build you can expect to lose unless you have a mostly coordinated team all geared and built to provide the DPS and support needed to win. I would not recommend PvP to any new player without first consulting with a PvP group in game sadly. As for the bad part of the PvE side, The Special task Force missions and Advanced Qeues have become a DPS race. You need to participate in advanced Qeues to get items needed for reputation gear. Often if you need reputation gear you are not in a position to contribute much to the team. another. Another issues is the complete lack of need for the Enginner and Science professions in game. In space missions and PvP they are vastly less valuable than a Tactical captain because they cannot produce the same kind of DPS. Having had thirty eight Max level characters before Delta Rising and Six after fully geared and tested to a minimum of 15k DPS and some to as high as 35k (Good but far from great measured by the Infected Space Advanced Standard) and often coordinating for PvP and having written a few of the build guides over the years I feel qualified to say this. It is just the nature of the game for now and may change with balancing as time goes on. On a final note for the PvE is a lack of attention to some bugs, though not game breaking, they can be irritating.All that said if you are still here I completely recommend this game. The good vastly outweighs the bad and I will continue to play so long as this is true. See you out there.",Tue Oct 12 08:03:25 EEST 2021,518fb077-db43-4ca6-8d24-2b9211a1b613

d400ae97-b7d0-423f-b5e9-7e70a2ecc35e,6,"One of the things that has always bugged me about MMOs is the long distance running to turn in quests. First they send you on a stupid quest to exact some justice on some lame fool who did something bad (insert short mission story line here), and when you finally get the guy and retrieve the spoils of battle from his cold dead corpse you have to run for days back to the quest giver to turn the mission in. So, for over an hour of gameplay you actually only played the game for maybe 5 minutes.  Not the case with Star Trek Online.In this space faring MMO you are the captain of your ship. You get to go out and have adventures and all that of a regular MMO with the flare of Star Trek. Along the way you can meet some characters from the shows. All that is to be expected. What was surprising was they way can get your quests. Like most MMOs you can walk up to a quest-giver and talk to them and they will give you the quest. In Star Trek Online you have the option of Calling them from your ship and selecting the mission from the list of available missions. It's almost as if the creators knew that you'd be a long, long way out in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't want to continually run back to to them just to turn in a quest. It is Star Trek, after all, why not just put them up on the main screen, Number One, and we can get on with our mission?Overall the graphics are basic for what systems can pull these days, and the voice acting in ok. The gameplay is a MMO game so you quest a lot. If you are a fan of Star Trek like me then you can forgive the game a lot and play for fun. At the sweet price of free, you don't even really need to be a fan to try it and see if space adventuring is right for you. Just keep in mind, if you are looking for the next blockbuster MMO to scale the mountain and dares all to knock them off of it, you're looking in the wrong place.

Only “hubs” that can only be reached by underground are dying.\nThere are tons of streets, squares, backyards, shops and apartments as well as sewers to explore. The possibility to get to inaccessible places via balconies or lifting platforms, to sneak past opponents or just to take a shortcut over the roofs is gigantic. The structure reminds me a bit of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/205100/]Dishonored[/url] only much nicer and much better.  Also the interiors are not quite as copy pasta as e.g. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/omn1cron/recommended/704270/]Generation Zero[/url] and make the whole thing more believable. Regardless of which building it is, everything is just completely thought out and extreme attention was paid to all details so that you get the feeling that it could actually be a place in the near future. The game offers immense mobility in the sometimes extremely nested levels, but these are never really confusing.\n\nIn terms of play, Mankind Divided is, in my opinion, more aimed at players who do not necessarily want to shoot their way through the game armed to the teeth, but rather at those who want to penetrate a building unnoticed or secretly want to sneak into an enemy camp and get themselves also take the necessary time for the game. Unfortunately, the game has a few weaknesses here so that it happens that you are discovered, for reasons that are not yet apparent to me, or \""civilians\"" panic simply and for no reason and thus trigger an \""alarm\"".\nAt this point I would also like to briefly note that it is advisable to save the game status more often in the game.

I still frequently play bot matches or zombies, sometimes with friends, but there is zero online presence now. Even if it was still popular online, it's not worth anything near $60. This game is over nine years old now. There are probably kids younger than this game playing Call of Duty and we're still expected to pay full price for it? This game is worth an absolute max of $30, probably less, and the DLC's need steep discounts too. It is quite literally impossible to enjoy 100% of this game without online play, so why are we still paying 100% of the original price? Activision would almost certainly profit more if they slashed the prices of old CoD games. I love the franchise but I'm sick of this money hungry antics that only work to drive customers away.\n\n*Note: It shows I only have about 90 minutes of playtime.

bdaa13ae-e4b6-4452-a377-fb6655574b31,7,"""I know I have 800+ hours in this game and I am giving it a thumbs down. I am doing this because I have simply felt that this game has lost all substance and is just squeezing it's tired player base for more cash.\n\nFor starters I bought the base game when it released, it's two mini expansions and it's mega expansion that launched in 2018. All of which is now obsolete. For starters they made the base game and it's two mini expansions free, so I lost $100 right there off the bat. Forsaken has been the only source of content in this game since it's release as well. They have added very little to no content worthwhile until Beyond Light which in itself was such a letdown that it barely added any content. So you are still getting Forsaken gear. But not only that, before Beyond Light's release they sunset, which is just a fancy word for deleted. All of the base game and mini expansions content leaving it even more bare boned than it was. They just straight up deleted all of the stuff people paid for and made whatever was left over level capped so it was not even usable, everything you earned in the past is now obsolete. Furthermore they are now repeating this and \""sunsetting\"" Forsaken content taking away what people paid for yet again. So they obviously not opposed to just deleting people's stuff and charging them for new stuff. Did I mention that they will still be recycling Forsaken armour and weapons by just releasing it in their new seasons. Who loves recycled content!? Not me. Honestly Bungo is pretty incapable of making a good decision so honestly just stay away. Don't even bother downloading the F2P part because there is nothing available in it. All of the rewards that are worth anything are locked behind the premium expansions that they will inevitable take away form you one day. Buying Destiny 2 expansions is the equivalent of putting money in a furnace. Now the thing that absolutely set me off the edge is how they split up their newest expansion which is The Witch Queen into 3 different packs that are all at premium currency. That's right folks. You have to buy the game 3 times to get it's content you are looking at a grand total of $120+ for an expansion. That they will probably just delete in two to three years. That is INCREDIBLE. I cannot fathom how far up their own asses Bungo employees and execs are that they completely high off of their own fumes to where their game that recycles, deletes and overcharges 97.4% of itself is somehow worth over 120 dollars for a new expansion. Oh my God why and how. I have poured 800+ hours of my time into a product that barely is able to give you six hours of content. This game has become a bounty grinding simulator, that is all you do. Bounties. Once you've completed one you have done it all. An absolute waste. That's not even 1% of the plethora of issues this crapfire has to offer though, it's lore and story is completely text based from random objects you find, how thrilling most of the game is explained rather than shown to you. Multiplayer is also completely broken because it is so unbalanced, the game is riddled with cheaters and people that exploit the game's rickety physics and mechanics. weapon balancing is completely broken and matchmaking is botched. I have never played a game with a more toxic multiplayer community than Destiny 2, Not even MW2 lobbies matched the level of toxicity this game's multiplayer exudes.\n\nIn the end do not give money to Bungo and don't play their garbage. They do not care about their player base so do not care about their \""product\"" if you can even call it that. This Bungie is not the people who made Halo, This Bungo is just the remnants of activision employees using the name of a dead company.""",Mon Nov 30 14:00:58 EET 2020,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one.

e421c4fd-5c7d-453a-b42e-0dff9bd4f1db,8,"""The great sequel to one of the finest linear shooters I've ever played.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is \""better\"" than in the previous title, but some of the polish feels unnecessary and detracts from the feel of the game. It's also signficantly easier than 2033, even on Ranger mode.\n\nFor example, the gunplay feels far smoother this time around. More... modern. While I can see why the developers took this route, it does make the shooting a bit generic. It's still fun, but doesn't have the impact 2033 did: Last Light's gunplay feels closer to modern military shooters than STALKER. \n\nThere's even more emphasis on stealth and sneaking around than in the previous game, but this part has the same problem the shooting does. Actually getting detected takes a bit of effort: the visibility indicator only has two \""modes\"" now: completely invisible and 'kind of' visible. The silliest thing is that most of the areas in this game aren't actually dark at all. You can, quite literally, sneak 50cm in front of a guy in a room parially lit by sunlight! As long you're not directly lit by a lamp or something, you're effectively invisible. If you somehow manage to screw up and end up 'visible' in front of an enemy, there's at least a 2-second period between \""Did I see something?\"" and \""Open fire!\"", which easily lets the player hide again. The AI forgets everything within a few seconds and resets back to the patrol path.\n\nOne nice addition to the stealth system is the lethal and non-lethal takedowns. Actually choosing which ones you employ is mostly irrelevant: the AI never reacts to either the 'What the hell?'s or screams. In some parts of the game, you may earn moral points (for getting the 'good' ending) by sparing enemies, but other than that, there's no difference whatsoever between murdering everyone with a knife or punching  everyone in the face. Better system than the seemingly random knife killing in 2033.\n\nThe gas mask filter mechanic is mostly irrelevant in Last Light. There's absolutely no way anyone could ever run out of filter time, even on Ranger mode's cut down supply spawns. The system itself makes much more sense this time, with a more obvious timer for individual filters and the total time of all filters combined. Nice, but as I said, filters are never an issue in Last Light, so the improvements are a bit of waste.\n\nEnemy variety is far greater this time. Instead of 2033's running monster, flying monster and Russian guy with a gun, there are now several distinct variants of the basic 'rat' monsters, huge spiders that can only be killed by frying them with a light source, armoured Russian guy and large shrimp-like mutants, in addition to the old enemies. \n\nAll the mutant types also have a larger boss version. Sounds cool, but the boss mechanics are all absolutely identical:\n1. Boss attacks you, small cutscene.\n2. Run away from boss in large arena.\n3. Stun boss by shooting in the face or having it charge into a wall.\n4. Shoot.\nThis is how all the mutant boss fights go. Not very exciting at all.\n\nThe absolute biggest improvement is found in storytelling and character interaction. This time, the storyline is more about the people of the Metro, instead of an outside threat. All the important characters now have unique faces and clothing, and actual story arcs! A massive improvement overall, but there is one character whose story feels totally out of place and random (Anna). The main storyline picks up from 2033's default (bad) ending, and focuses on the conflicts of the various groups in the Metro. While storytelling is improved, I personally prefer 2033's actual storyline, as it has more of a philosophical aspect to it, instead of \""just\"" a three-way conflict between the Red Line, the Reich and Sparta / Polis.\n\nLast Light has the best graphics I've ever seen in a video game. A relatively small improvement over 2033's graphics, and an absolutely massive improvement in optimization: solid 60fps at high settings on my piece of shit PC is quite impressive.\nAudio is mostly the same as in 2033, except for dialogue, which sounds much clearer this time. \n\nSo, this ended up mostly being a comparison between LL and 2033. Whatever. Will add thoughts on DLC once I've finished them all.\n\nGreat game, better than 2013's other big shooter, Bioshock Infinite, but not as good as Metro2033.""",Sat Jun 12 13:43:58 EEST 2021,8f4801d7-1b7d-4a01-9197-8c9c6f184d5e

The lack of long-term content.\n-the long-term content (which is what i call it) is boring/enraging/repetitive, any order and combination counts. the PVP is made to attract players to play the game more, but its currently the biggest cancer since its a bit of a no-brain fuck fest. with the amount of broken weapons being abused and amount of sweatlords that ruin your chances of getting loot in trials and ruining your enjoyment and you have a very cancerous tumor in the game, gambit is fine with teammates you can coordinate in, but that is irregular and not worth a lot for playing full time. and alot of good content to play, is behind a pay wall.\n3. The game's lack of story\nthis one is not as big of a problem than the others, but the lack of a story for new-comers (or a pile of confused mess) is a bit off-putting hence not giving them interest in the game in the immediate moment.\n\nwith the game's glaring flaws it does have good things.\none is that this game is a gold mine for people who are really interested in special, unique weapons and lore-hunting, to worlds-first raids and community events, this game is made for people heavily interested in this game (myself included), the game has certain fun missions for the people who grind hard or play \""for fun\"", and even a volley of new things on the way for dedicated players to enjoy, like witch queen and its new crafting system. overall this game is a mixed back, because its target audience is very specific, thus not having a lot of people interested in it, but those who are, are awesome and one of the most dedicated and most fun people I could ever find ever (ex. CBGray, Sweatcicle and some other lfg raiders) and it's  a very fun community to join (except those apes in crucible) but the flaws are still there and should be noticed and fixed or changed in some form. \n\ni give it a 7/10\nits great but some things need to be fixed, and they need to give us more than just a few updates to beyond light and a giant pay-wall\n\ntl;dr\nthis game is too expensive, but its fun and addictive""",Wed Jan 12 07:49:51 EET 2022,c59a66be-2e41-4cc0-9cbf-eeb00d0dd08a

If you are even a little bit of a trekkie, there is a great deal of fun to be had here.That said, like most MMOs, it gets samey rather fast. It takes longer than most, which is something I really have to give the developers a great deal of kudos for, but eventually, you're going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. Something that helps combat this is that it has the concept of user-created missions. You can actually get on a special account type and create missions for others to play. These range from the awesome to the ""meh"", and is another unique feature to STO.The fact that this is free to play, and the paid addons are reasonable, makes it definitely one of the better MMO's out there.

Stealth, this is as good as it gets, to put it simply there are so many ways to approach a situation that every one can have their cup of tea.\nThis particular game has pretty short main campaign but the amount of side content makes up for it in my opinion. Which also in my opinion belongs to 'highest quality side content' section of RPG rankings. The side quests perfectly fit in the world and the conflicts that the main campaign is dealing with seamlessly. The characters are so well written and unique, the writing overall is pretty good.

cb46c706-63af-4de7-8778-35ce1653ddf7,5,"-As of November 21st of 2015, this review is woefully outdated. Be aware-Actually one of the more decent MMOs I've played. Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",Thu Jan 06 09:02:36 EET 2022,d7cb2937-e34a-4b9e-a4be-f0580c2e169d

You get sucked into the game from start to finish. Characters are well-made and interesting, voice acting is top-notch and everything emotions are displayed as they should. At the same time however, I miss a big overhauling objective to the story. It feels like you’re doing a bunch of random smaller chores. And although there is a reason as to why you’re doing most of them, it just misses a real important goal at times. And because of this, after a while the game starts to feel unnecessarily long. I do think it’s much better if you free roam more and do the campaign in between, but if you’re the type of player that just focuses on the main story first, you might feel the same as I did.\n\nNow this is not to say I didn’t have fun playing through the story. Missions are well done and fun to play, there is a lot of diversity and again, the storytelling / and character development is great, and you really do get sucked into this game. It grasps you and does not let you go until you see the credits scrolling by. It’s also great that you can choose which main quest you want to do yourself, instead of following a strict path.\n\nNow on to the world itself. It looks amazing, it feels amazing to travel through and the ambiance is like nothing I have ever seen before. It’s so immersive and alive. There is something to do in each small town, there are random encounters / side quests throughout the world and activities like hunting, fishing and playing games are really fun to do.\n\nTalking about gameplay, it’s great and makes the game feel like a movie sometimes. Cover shooting works good and interesting with NPC’s is perfect, but it has a classic Rockstar feeling to it as well. It’s a bit slow and clunky. You can’t react or shoot as fast as you want to and some things just feel like they’re being forced to look cinematic. Something all Rockstar games have if you ask me. The same goes for navigating menus & inventories. It just feels outdated.\n\nSo should you buy RDR2? Hell yes. It’s one of the best games I have played in a long time. It has an amazing story, beautiful scenery, a great soundtrack and zero to no bugs. This together with a compelling story which is quite lengthy (it took me 46 hours to complete) makes for a great all around experience.""",Wed Jun 16 12:15:14 EEST 2021,25f037fa-4466-4307-b890-94626d392ed5

It tends to lose itself in the background noise of every other MMO around. It does nothing really special, but it is fun to try to design your own ship and uniforms, and pick your own crew. The only real criticism of this game is the same that I have of every MMO: you are not unique. You have the same gear, access to the same missions, and are captain of a starship just like every other player. Areas around planets and space stations are clogged with dozens of starships, all captained by players. I feel this is evidence of a systemic assumption in MMO design, that players don't want to work for anything. I feel it would have been far more compelling if they required you to work up to being a captian with your own ship.From a technical standpoint, I have constant issues with the servers being down. I often get significant lag followed by the termination of my connection and (when I try to log back on) the server is down. This is not an occasional thing. Just about every time I sit down to play. I'm pretty positive this is not an issue on my end, as I don't encounter this problem anywhere else.

Great shooting, awesome soundtrack, nice and fluid graphics, a perfect reboot for a classic of the genre. Keep in mind that continuous movement and strategic thinking while on the move are key elements in this game, there's no time to stop and plan the next move. But that's Doom's strength, like it or hate it.\n\nWeaknesses? Maybe the maps are a bit too linear even if well built and the story lacks originality. But you don't play Doom for that, you play Doom to shoot everything that moves while looking really cool doing it! :)\n\n8 out of 10 for me!""",Mon Sep 30 18:06:14 EEST 2019,f08e39ac-76ac-4179-80b1-22fac794c1dc
9c1743bd-029b-4034-9825-32771e208d22,3,"My opinion? I would say about 7/10.First, as a Trek fan I enjoy that it continues the story of the Prime universe, and that there are tons of call backs, references, and even cameos.Now, when I started, I admittedly felt like the controls were a tad awkward, but once I got used to them. I've found that that's all I really needed: to get used to them.The space combat is highly reminicent of what's seen in the shows/movies, even including attacks/abilities that can be traced to commands given by the various captains across the generations.The ground combat/missions could be better, but I personally find them tolerable.The graphics are good, but not fantastic, and it tells a good story overall.Also, if you love the ability to customize virtually everything(no, that's not an exageration), you'll get a kick out of this game. You can customize your outfits, your ships(with some restrictions based ship's class/type etc), alter your bridge officers, and even create your own species.The crafting system is a bit tedious, and materials are hard to come by, but it's not horrible.Now, if I had to name my biggest issue with this game, its the same as most MMOs: the microtransactions. By using real money to by 'Zen'(100 Zen = $1), you can unlock a lot of stuff, but some of it is kinda petty and/or overpriced. For example if you want to get a new ship past level 50(that's appropriate to your level), you better be willing to pay out $25 PER SHIP. Granted,, there are other ways to secure new level appropriate ships, but most are geared for LV 50, and require grinding for special currencies to aquire.Also, I have to say I've notice the community tends to be a bit juvenile.  Even though there do appear to be some more mature people among the community, by and large I would recommend just soloing unless you really need help.So, overall the gameplay is enjoyable and good for Trek fans, plus it also has some good storytelling and decent graphics. But, the petty money stuff and largely immature community are a bit offputting. If you are a Trek fan, or just love MMOs with lots of customization and decent story, check it out, and enjoy some nostalgia.If you aren't a Trek fan, can't stand stupid players, or hate microtransactions...feel free to give it a try, but it may not be for you.",Mon Jul 29 23:01:06 EEST 2019,86f49d86-074f-4a2f-88f6-2df9bc277837

Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Fri Oct 22 22:33:31 EEST 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

This lasts for several chapters.\n\nThen give the return of antlions, but rather than keeping the prior canon of them knowing where you are via vibrations in HL2, here that doesn't apply, and the way you counter them is putting a car on their spawn points so it doesn't become a shitty L4D2.\n\nThe parts where your alone in the Citadel and the part where you're alone after escort final boss are easily the best parts.

882bbf37-4297-4c85-8abd-4c48826a3398,3,"I've been playing this game on and off for around three years, have a lifetime sub, and five alts to my main. My hours on Steam are not accurate as I have played this through the STO launcher, Champions Online launcher, and Arc. As someone who has well over 1000 hours invested into this game, I feel obligated to tell you this game is in no way P2W or paywalled. The people who say these things are either bad at the game or can't be bothered to get dilithium and buy ships. NO ship is overpowered, bar the Scimitar which is just ridiculous. Some ships excel at their role, yes, but there is no overpowered. PVP is dead, so anyone using that as a measurement is fighting against people who have invested time into their characters.On to the actual review. STO is a Star Trek MMORPG developed by Cryptic Studios, a company that is really passionate about their babies. There are glorious space battles to be had, as you go from ensign to admiral over your character's career. You start off against the Klingons in tradition Trek fashion and things quickly escalate. Missions are divided into arcs that act almost as seasons, with some very impressive set pieces that are played around with.The character customization is almost overwhelming, with just about every species having a place and the ability to customize your own alien species. This customizability extends to uniforms and bridge officers, who are like your companions in other games. You choose their looks, their weapons, and their abilities. Every character, yourself included, is divided into three careers: Engineering, Science, and Tactical. These give you basic abilities that you can use regardless of your ship, all of which are fairly useful. Tacs excel at damage, sci  toons can pull some space debuffing magic, and engineers are gods of fortifying their hulls with extreme amounts of health. Any captain can pilot any ship, regardless of what type of ship that is. There is no forced progression path into a certain ship.I'll touch on ships here, since that's what we're looking for. There are dozens of ships ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 6. You get a new ship every ten levels, stopping at 40. 40-50 is T5, with everything above 50 being T6. T6 ships can be bought for real money, earned frome events, or bought by converting dilithium to zen. The conversion rate is around 160 dil per zen, which fluctuates a fair bit. T6 ships cost 3000 zen, which might seem like a lot because it is. You can refine 8000 dilithium per day as a basic player, so it'll take a while to earn and refine that much. Once you fall into a nice pattern, this isn't something that seems grindy.The difficulty of the game is fairly low, although the average player might have some difficulties if they aren't aware of how the game works. This is a simple, but shockingly deep game. Don't worry about loot until you hit 50, then find what you want to do. The game doesn't have to be just about damage, everyone has a place.

[i]Episode One[/i] doesn't add much to the story of any particular substance beyond setting up the events of [i]Episode Two[/i], but the gameplay setpieces and level design are interesting enough to sustain the 3-4 hours of solid shooter gameplay that players of the previous games will know inside and out. \n\n[i]Episode One[/i] relies a lot on zombie setpieces, it feels like - a lot of the game's runtime is spent dealing with zombies, whether in the city's underbelly (waiting for an elevator to arrive) or in an abandoned hospital that isn't really abandoned. There's still a lot of Combine to fight, and each of those fights feel great. \n\nAlyx is one of the best parts of the game too - you have her tagging along basically every step of the way, and her presence is particularly helpful in grounding you in the game's story, and giving you someone to actually fight alongside, rather than long stretches with very little human contact. It theoretically makes the game easier having an unkillable character fighting alongside you, but it's still challenging enough to remain fun.\n\nThere's not much more to say, really - if you do, for whatever reason, already own [i]Half-Life 2[/i] and not this, and you enjoyed it - then really, this is a no-brainer. It contains all the classic [i]Half-Life 2[/i] elements - well-written characters, physics-based combat, solid and satisfying gunplay, and survival horror sections.

(Seriously, 60$ is a bit too much for a game that is this old) Also, Activision and Treyarch has refused to acknowledge that there is a security vulnerability (Remote Code Execution) exploits thus has done nothing about it, yet sells it on Steam or other stores for that price. \n\nAbout the RCE, multiple people have reported the security problems (one person even reporting it to Steam about Activision/Treyarch leaving a game with a security vulnerability), but has been ignored by both Activision/Treyarch and Valve. If you buy this game, only buy it for single player, unless you want to get your system hacked and have a online hacker damage your system or cause problems. This is a known problem that has been plaguing the game for years, and has been discussed in online communities.\n\nIf you definitely intend to buy this game for online play, be aware that the only way to play online without security problems is to install something like Plutonium for multiplayer, to avoid being attacked by hackers online.\n\nAnother thing, the game heavily blocks modding for single player, unlike Black Ops 1 (which has modding capabilities using fan modding tools, and CoD4 or World at War, which has native modding support for both single player and multiplayer modding). This also applies to games like Modern Warfare 3, and newer Call of Duty games. The last game to support native modding is Black Ops 3. To mod Black Ops 2 for everything other than multiplayer, mod tools would be required, at least one that has not been released yet to the public.\n\nIf you are looking for adding mods like skin and player character 3d model replacement for both single player (campaign mode) and multiplayer, only older games are supported, with Modern Warfare 2 receiving limited support due to some community members. Well, I'm hoping that Treyarch/Activision will release official mod support/tools for these games, but that's unlikely).\n\nFor reference, search CVE-2018-20817 online (search this up for the article about the security vulnerability exploit), and if you don't know what it is, search \""Black Ops 2 Remote Code Execution\"" on Google. There are many people covering this problem. Another interesting thing, CVE Details also has an entire list of vulnerabilities that games published by Activision has, but has done nothing about. Those include: CVE-2019-20893, CVE-2018-10718, CVE-2012-4918, CVE-2008-2106, CVE-2006-5058, CVE-2005-0983, and CVE-2004-1664.""",Sat Jul 17 17:15:54 EEST 2021,cb97fd84-e1a0-45c5-b5a4-fcb960da0791

27f43d5b-74cd-4a01-bf29-a35aaac6f3d6,6,"""[b] A good game, but not a worthy sequel.[/b]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]RATING:[/th]\n        [th]🌟🌟🌟 3/5[/th]\n[th]AVERAGE GAME[/th]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n[h1]Context[/h1]\nAfter playing Deux Ex: Human Revolution (DXHR) and genuinely falling in love with it, I immediately bought Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (DXMD) expecting more of that universe. Unfortunately, this game is quite the opposite of DXHR. A clear example on how to destroy a sequel.\n\nThe sequels should always be an improvement over the first one in every single aspect; inheriting the good and improving the flaws. DXMD only improved in graphics, some new augments and lethal combat, everything else is way worse compared to DXHR, especially the trade of minimalistic environment for a generic appearance with no personality and a plot that felt like an awful 40 hours DLC.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are one of the few good things about DXMD. Shining detailed weapons, Prague looks gorgeous, especially during rainy nights and Adam looks like a true cyborg.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2663070484 \n\n[*]Thankfully they kept most of the cool things about the combat, you can still cover with surfaces, take down enemies in melee range, use silencers, non-lethal weapons, etc.\n\n[*]It is worth saying that now lethal combat feels like an FPS should feel like, you can aim freely and weapons recoil feels realistic, they have also added a quick inventory to personalize your weapons on the run; equip/remove the silencer, change the scope, etc.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670289171\n\n[*]Most of the DXHR augmentation if not all, are still present in this game, they have also added plenty of new augments, like remote hacking, which is really fun to use.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670419431\n\n[*]Exploration is exactly the same as DXHR, which is the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\n[*]They kept the F5 to quick save your progress.\n\n[*]Hacking feels much more intuitive thanks to the hotkey shortcuts.\n\n[*]You can start a new game plus with your whole inventory, money and upgrades.\n\n[*]It has a recap video showing what happened in DXHR\n\nTrailer is really, really good.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There is no \""New Game++...\"" option. In case you don't know, this means you can only start a New Game+ using a normal game save.\n\n[*]The season pass includes 5 Praxis(upgrading points) that can only be claimed once, When I claimed them, my game crashed, and I lost the 5 Praxis forever, this is a known bug that won't be fixed at this point.\n\n[*]They are also trying to sell you Praxis for real money, a Praxis is worth $1~, which is the only legal possible way to fully max your character before starting a NG+, no matter how many hundreds of hours you invest.\n\n[*]Trash generic plot with nothing to say. You go like a headless chicken from a place to another, moving from an Eastern European accent NPC to another Eastern European accent NPC, and again, and again, and again, and again. After 5 hours, I had to start skipping some dialogs because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n[*]I couldn't connect with neither of the game's characters, not even with Adam Jensen, which I loved in DXHR.\n\n[*]They removed excellent characters like Malik Faridah, Megan Reed, Sarif and Pritchard, these last two can be seen in a couple of cutscenes, but that's it.\n\n[*]The world consists of a city hub and three~ other zones that are part of their respective missions that you can't revisit. You will be in Prague for the 80% of your playtime, dealing with random citizens problems.\n\n[*]Pointless \""Save random person A or random person B\"" decisions, which makes no sense if you can't empathize enough with them before having to choose.\n\n[*]Map disposition and enemy routes doesn't feel premeditated enough, which in this kind of games is one of the most important things.\n\n[*]They removed literally every single DXHR signature. Starting from the elegant architecture and color scheme to the art references and the eternal night ambiance that gave it personality. It also has lost that unique minimalistic immersion from DXHR in exchange of some kind of cheap Wolfenstein atmosphere.\n\n[*]Music didn't manage to transmit me a single emotion; long shot, but I bet they have used all of Michael McCann tracks they initially discarded in DXHR just to save up some money.\n\n[*]Secondary missions are the worst I have ever seen, you can't really understand what's going on unless you open the quest menu and read it continuously.\n\n[*]Awful voice acting.\n\n[*]Black hair looks like wet black plastic, reflecting every single design flaw.\n\n[*]Policemen stopping you and asking for papers every first time you get to a station at different main story points, I think this can happen up to 15~ times and takes up to 20-25~ seconds, just like a second loading screen that cannot be skipped.\n\n[*]Multiple crashes playing it, especially during \""A criminal past\"" DLC\n\n[*]DLC's includes special edition weapons, but you can't loot ammo from regular versions of these weapons without having a regular version of said weapon in your inventory, wasting precious and limited inventory capacity.\n\n[*]The ending felt incomplete, abrupt and unsatisfactory.\n\n[*]Unskippable 20 minute ending credits as a cherry on the top.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'm giving it a positive review because it is not a bad game at all, however, I think that wasted potential in sequels should be always be punished by the players, and DXHR sequel had so much more potential than this, so I can't fully recommend it neither.\n\n\n[h1]To buy or not to buy?[/h1]\nBuy it, but only on a sale, and keep your expectations low to avoid disappointments.\n\nAlso, stay away from the Season Pass and the DLC's.\n\n\n[quote=] See you in the [i]Country.[/i][/quote]""",Tue Nov 30 06:45:13 EET 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799

The in game events are completely linear, it doesn't matter what the players really do because its all decided by the developers. The restriction on the level are really awful, I hate the RPG aspects of this game. A plus side is the foundry which allows you to make your own missions and play other people''s levels too. Another thing I hate is the level system, the enemy AI scales with you and since after Level 50, you HAVE to purchase your own ship and if you can't, you'll be screwed because the enemy becomes overpowered. All in all, if you're willing to buy stuff with money or grind resources to get what you want, I say go for it.

But I kept coming back, as it was very interesting.\nGameplay-wise, it's the same as previous game, with very few additional mechanics. You can play lethally or non-lethally. You can go stealth or full-assault mode. \nThe visual side amazing. Everything looks very detailed, locations are beautifully designed with a great attention to their functionality. I was often going around stunned by the quality and huge quantity of unique assets - all the fake posters, ads, books, items. Every little appartment had some visual story. The costumes are outstandin. The developers did a really great job creating an illusion of a functioning, future world.\nNow, what's bad. First of all, story and locations. There is one big hub city (Praha), very nicely designed (a lot prettier and interesting than Detroit!) and you come back to it after main missions. Apart from that there are 4 more other locations connected with main quests - and 3 of them are quite bland. I think there should be more memorable places (I can recall more emotional bits from DXHR that I played a few years ago that this part, played a week ago). The story seems a bit short and compressed. I was surprised that many characters were there just for one task or moment and didn't return later in game. It feels that many plotlines are not resolved. There is just one \""boss fight\"", in the end, and you can end it in a few seconds. Watching the trailers, after playing whole game, I think that some concepts, places (ie. Rabi'lah) and characters were introduced to play a much larger part, but they were scrapped later. The game could have also offered a few more dramatic moments, with characters important for us. Wasted potential? Also, it's a shame that the DLC missions are not integrated with the main game - even thought they would be perfect side missions to gather more xp and equipment.\nAlthough there are achievements for playing non-lethally and without turning any alarms on, the developers didn't include any indication if you still have \""clean\"" account, sadly. One glitched body or camera may cancel all your effort and you won't even know where you lost it.\nTo sum up, the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has technical issues, crashes a lot, its story is interesting but short and feels unfinished with many loose ends and unused characters. The game world is beautifully designed, with attention to details, and the gameplay with stealth mechanics is as good as before (or even better, with a few more options). \nIf you're not easily discouraged by crashes and you liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution, give it a go.""",Sat Feb 06 09:50:05 EET 2021,9be57e49-e6a7-4a06-a7d5-5ab386d76799
