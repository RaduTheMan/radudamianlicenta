CSGO has hit rock bottom with Valve's missed promises of game changing updates and their lack of effort to combat the terrible cheating problem. Bugs have been in the game for years and still haven't been fixed. Cheating is out of control. Over the past few years of playing, cheating has gotten worse and worse to the point now where I end up playing against a cheater almost every game. Valve implemented the new ""trust"" matchmaking system to combat some of these issues but its lackluster algorithm still somehow thinks putting me, with years of gameplay and 3,000+ hours, against people playing on brand new accounts makes sense. I really don't know why I still put the effort to play this game anymore because it usually just ends up with me regretting it. I guess I just wish I could somehow have the fun I used to have playing this game but it seems those days are long gone.",Fri Oct 08 07:35:27 EEST 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

2bd2caa3-d8e1-48dd-a84c-daf380c78258,10,"I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.",Wed May 19 07:36:52 EEST 2021,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6
2bd2caa3-d8e1-48dd-a84c-daf380c78258,4,"It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.

ffc814fb-ca85-454d-a16c-b82c0edd22ce,6,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",Sun Oct 17 08:59:57 EEST 2021,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

Valve is doing basically bussiness with them by cashing out on their behaviour. Don't buy this game. Also all the weapon skins/ stickers/ glove skins/ sprays etc. are just terrible.

924d1b19-b737-4a45-8f70-3b1c4265e140,8,"Review: Counter Strike: Global OffensiveGameplay:The Game mechanics are in my opinion pretty simple yet extremely effective.Aiming feels almost flawless, no weapons are overpowered if you have enough experience.Game isnt really trying to be realistic. Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps)CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter.Multiplayer:Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.Community:The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages. (malaka, cy ka bly at, kur wa, ich fick deine mutter, youre g ay, blo ody bas tard, kardashian) some examples.Graphics:Game looks ok for a 2004 source engine.

947779b0-4210-47bf-833c-fc572f325024,2,"Let's give this game an honest review.Okay I wanna start by saying that I am a CS series Fan. I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.Community:The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:1. Easter European Children,2. Normal People,3. Cheaters.CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.Gun Balance:Okay this one is good.Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!  Developer Support: After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies.",Sun Feb 14 22:15:39 EET 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

Literally this game was amazing and then they destroyed it by jumping on something that changed the game completely. Its free now there goes my money. This game was great until they chose to not be original and jump on every trend out there. Thats what killed this game.,Wed May 05 09:50:40 EEST 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

It annoys me that when I finally have the patiences to sit down and write a review about this game, that it had to be a negative one. I liked this game, loved it at some point, but it has evolved into a monsterious sh*t hole of a game. The updates are just getting rediculous. I have had, give or take, 1600 hours of competitive gameplay done and the ranking system is completely unreliable. I agree with most of the comments that say ""When you reach a certain rank, all you get are hackers."". I've read so many comments on how the community would like for VAC to be better and yet game developers are ignoring this call. Instead, they're making updates of which benefits them ""financially"". Like who in the world said that gloves would be a f*cking great asset to the game and that we needed more things to waste our money on. The game itself is cheap, yes, but the fact that the past updates has been about gaining money is beyond my comprehension. Please fix the game, thank you.Edit: I see now the game has gone Free To Play and implemented Battle Royale. What the hell is Valve thinking? The amount of hackers 10 updates ago were lots but still bareable (around 1 hacker per 15 matches) and now you've gone and opened the doors to them. I am glad I left the game before the previous free-to-play update was released. If any of you guys wanted this game and are happy about the FTP, trust me, you're going to regret getting this.",Sun Aug 01 05:47:39 EEST 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

9569dda6-287e-482f-97b7-0643f8db4ccc,8,"(Update 24th of december)It's just not what it's used to be anymore..Community:COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.",Thu Jun 17 20:05:10 EEST 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

Liked:
- The graphics are pure eye candy, while lower res than C1 they look nice and shiny and give great performance across most all systems.
- The gameplay is vastly refined while some say ""simplified"" I find it has more depth and more possibilities for you as a gamer to use and just enjoy.
- The campaign has its highs and lows. The highs can be pretty epic and the lows can be extremely boring. In the middle you have walking, walk from point a to point z, rince wash repeat.

7cbde59f-2fdd-4097-a06a-f305c9d72157,6,"The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years:  5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate  entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning.

7cbde59f-2fdd-4097-a06a-f305c9d72157,8,"This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.The real ranking system:Cheaters on topScammers in the middleLegit players at the bottomAt no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are. It's just a big joke.",Sun Oct 24 18:56:10 EEST 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

7cbde59f-2fdd-4097-a06a-f305c9d72157,4,"Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at.  A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!",Tue Oct 26 19:54:50 EEST 2021,7538609a-a5e1-47e9-9b84-f27b650d683c

c00947d4-f44f-47d3-bc15-4b0e88df2db8,10,"The state of this game is an absolute whale of a joke. Valve has shown time and time again for the past 6 years that they could not give one single one about the community matters. Time and time again over this particular game's history, we see them not listen to the community. Honestly, this is the final straw. Nobody asked for Battle Royale, and you can be assured that nobody asked for a free-to-play game. or prime status to all.I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore. I thought getting out of gold was hard before, how about when you can't be sure if that new account really is cheating or not? I paid 15 dollars for this game, but now anybody can get it? Sure, free-to-plays cannot get prime unless they buy the game, but since when has that stopped cheaters? Who is gonna stop the 15 year old with his Christmas money and aimwar⁤e who just aquired a new prime copy of the game? You might aswell give prime to them already because they weren't being stopped.The game plays pretty alright for 64-tick servers, I guess. It's hard to say ""the game is good, community & company are garbage"" because the game isn't even that good. Battle Royale does not fit in this game because CS:GO's combat system isn't really designed for it. It feels like a rushed thing that they just wanted to do to attract more peoples' wallets.In short, the game doesn't really play as well as others, the company does not care at all, and it's just really not that fun.",Thu Aug 13 14:47:30 EEST 2020,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f
ef9c523e-21cf-4af2-a4c4-9c107834177d,7,"CS:GO is a world famous FPS known for its intense, unique, and deep gameplay and its strong presence in the eSports scene. It's also the game that, at the time of writing this review, I have put the most hours into. It's so addicting, and if you find the right team to play with that communicates and strategizes, is an absolute blast and one of the best FPS games I have ever played.PositivesGreat graphics. The graphics on this game have aged well and look good. They're solid enough to not make you go blind.Built on the Source engine. I've always been a fan of the Source engine. It's very easy to run on any PC, has solid graphics, a deep options menu, which means the game is avaliable to tons of people.Great Gameplay. With smooth movement, unique spray patterns on all the guns, deep strategies gameplay wise and economically wise, ability to move silently, and more, CS:GO's gameplay is awesome. I like it a lot, and I find it very unique. The movement is smooth as well.Everyone is on an even playing field. The skills of a player only rely on their aim, reflexes, and expertise of the game, not XP like in CoD. For example, the other team can't automatically win just because they are all above level 50 and your team is a bunch of level 2s and 3s.Balanced maps. The maps of CS:GO are fine tuned, expertly crafted, and are all unique in their own ways. The defuse maps are constantly updated with tweaks to make them the best that they can be. Some maps receive complete makeovers, such as Train and Nuke, with Dust2 possibly recieving one very soon. The hostage and demolition maps are usually left in the dust as they're underplayed, but they're still solid maps.Operations. These are special events that Valve hold every couple months called Operations. For the price of $7, you can play two player co-op missions with a buddy and get case drops that you can turn around and sell for a dollar or two. Valve also release specially picked community-made maps that everyone can play for free.Community Servers. These servers host custom maps from the workshop. They also host custom gamemodes such as 1v1 and Surf.Skins. I find skins overall neat. While Valve can throw in some ugly and stupid skins, most of the skins are awesome, and are affordable. Some skins range from 3 pennies to thousands of dollars. The only skins I buy are ones that are under a dollar, with my rifle skins being a few dollars. There's likely no way in a million years I'm buying a thousand dollar skin.Gamemodes for both casual and hardcore gamers. While hardcore players will grind competitive defuse for hours a day, there's gamemodes for the casual player too, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, and a casual version of defuse that is easier than competitive defuse.Able to host your own server. While you can buy dedicated servers from various server hosters across the web, you can host your own server off your PC for free by downloading server files directly from Valve, and install custom plugins. I recently started to host my own server for me and a friend where I made it into a 1v1 server. While it's tough to set up, which happens with every server, it's awesome that you can do it for free.MixedToxic community. While there's teammates that are supportive and will communicate and strategize with you, there's also teammates that will insult and harass you if you aren't playing well. They will scream ""He's over there, dumba**! A MAIN!"" in your ear while you're trying to focus on the game. It's insanely annoying, and always gets you killed. Because you died, he'll start a vote to kick you. Screw those toxic POSs. There's teammates that have no idea what they're doing and will run and gun like it's CoD, along with having awful crosshair placement, so they'll be looking at walls when they die. There's teammates that will yell into their mic and act like they're funny. It's a community that's a dense minefield of good and bad, and one bad player can completely ruin your experience.Glove Skins. While I think skins are awesome, I think they're good enough on the guns. Valve have made glove skins, which I rarely see people use. It's just silly to make glove skins while people have been asking for 128 tick servers and a stricter anti-cheat for ages.NegativesVAC isn't the best. While Valve has been fighting cheaters with VAC and the recent creation of the Overwatch system, where specially picked CSGO players can review footage of reported players and judge if they're cheating, hackers are still thriving in CSGO. It's an infamous issue that has plagued the game for ages. While they aren't in every single match you play, they still exist, especially in the higher ranks of competitive.Gambing and Match Betting. Skins have caused negative things to happen that Valve weren't anticipating. People will gamble skins on coin flips and such, which leads into the skin gambling contraversy that exploded not too long ago, and people will bet on matches with skins. It's just sketchy stuff, and has generated some toxicitiy in the CSGO community.64 tick servers. I think 128 tick servers are needed, especially for a game as competitive as CSGO. With all the money Valve has made from CSGO, it's likely that they can update their servers to 128 tick so gameplay is smoother and server-side issues aren't as much of a problem.SummaryDespite all the toxicity associated with the game, CSGO is still a great game in my eyes. It's a unique FPS that I will happily play for many more hours to come so I can hone my skills and become a dominant player.I decided to archive my old review.

Hacking is pointless and stupid and makes the game not fun for others. Just play the actual game.

I love Valve. I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it.",Sun Jan 17 03:44:17 EET 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

f5ab5e89-621b-42f7-8066-758a100db40e,10,"Note: This is a temporary review, I'm still pretty new to the game so I'll write another one when I invest/waste more hours on it-My First GameI remember it really well, because it was a game that summed up CSGO almost perfectly. Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.-GamemodesCasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily.Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):MeAmerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensAngry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseAnother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuesSomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vieOther team:Uber SmurfSomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiesSomeone in a partySomeone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a roundAnime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and ScoutUh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui-Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: AKs-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and ArmorCounter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy-Round Two: Some SMG-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and ArmorEco Round? Doesn't exist in low Silver xDSave? Doesn't really happenStrategy? ""B"", ""Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it.You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill.-Rank up SystemCS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.-SmurfingA ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.-VAC System/OverwatchYeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.-CommunityI've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstopUnmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!""Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/Cuties and Hotties (right here)Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the gamePeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of themGrill GamersPeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GOThere are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.-CS:GO Skins and CasesI've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.-Valve/Game DevelopersEh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.-Friendly Aspect to the game?Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.-Overall OpinionIt's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come. Dayum, that was a LONG review, its just that CS:GO has so much in it to cover. It's pretty good.",Mon Sep 06 01:09:28 EEST 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team.

If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo.But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun.

Well, to begin with Counter Strike is a very unique FPS game.  i first played this game in spring 2013 on and off. i finally think i have enough experience to write a review. Unlike other fake games we shall not name (CoD, BF) this game requires some knowledge and skill to play. Pros:Counter Strike does not require a super beefy computer and can be played with a average set up and hardwareCounter Strike has a ""decent"" community and most players are friendly to the other players (i said ""decent"")Counter Strike is not a pay to win game, you are not required to pay money and keep playing, the Operation passes are to support the devs and help keep the game going.Counter Strike has a growing community and you should be able to find competitve matches quickly (depending on the maps you select)Counter Strike has Dust II, Dust II is the best map every created for Competitive level of gameplay.Counter Strike is not FTP, if Counter Strike was FTP the community would crumbleCons:Counter Strike has had problems with Smurfs in the past, the problem has been fixed a little bit, but there are still some smurf problems. Smurfs can ruin a entire game and i know some players who quit playing because of the SmurfsCounter Strike has some hacker and cheater problems, i have played many games where i have run into a cheater. Cheaters ruin the game and it is no fun to play with cheaters.(There are some players who will play without a mic, grief, or throw games, this mostly occurs at lower levels, however i have not run into many of these players)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are my thoughts on the game Counter Strike: Global OffensiveI would really suggest giving this game a try if you have not tried it before Thank you for taking your time and reading my review- Boingdom",Tue Dec 14 05:35:06 EET 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

bc8d4720-2d5d-4a70-b4af-c9b233da9b0a,4,"The new revolver is stupid. CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:Sorry about the rant but this update has been rather disappointing xD",Mon Jan 03 17:37:20 EET 2022,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

I want my money back.I was really annoyed at the time this review was written, so pardon my redundant vocabulary throughout this review.Valve taking advantage of their customersComparable to other greedy f**knuggets in the gaming industry, today, Valve has set the bar up there with EA and Bethesda.You know what Valve, instead of using all that money and resources you got sitting over there to give us, your customers, our long awaited sequels we've respectfully requested since 2004. Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.Valve's GreedYour intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this?The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.EpilogueI can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from.This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated.Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.Here's a clip to summarize my experience in Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveBut tell me what you think.

Even if they claim to have ""fixed"" the whole HitBox system, is still s**t! I still was shooting people, seeing blood coming out, even heard the Headshot sound, but no reg. Funny thing right? Happens... (it should not)2) One of the Worst anti-Cheat system (VAC) that even a 14 years old kid, with a really small knowledge of programming can get through that by-pass. Funny thing when they released this whole ""Overwatch"" thing, when you are LEM with 2k+ hours, and there's a Gold Nova 2 with 350+ hours to judge your gameplay if you're hacking or not!3) Really bad gaming community including 12 y.o. kids from Different countries , having 0 knowledge of English. Same happened with older players. Toxic players are no. 2 problem, but I gotta admit, people are Not as toxic as the League of Legends' ones... 4) Really bad servers, with the whole valve giving 0 f***s about it. (64 ticks while Every damn other Community server has 128)5) Absolutely bad Game Support (you can't even e-mail them, you have to search deep to find an address to contact them)6) SMURFS. I had played some Smurfs games on it, pretty easy and stuff, but NO worth... as I had my♥♥♥♥♥kicked from Supremes and Globals, and I was pretty mad about it, I stopped doing that! Many people just wanna show off their skill to Low rank people, are something more than Pathetic! unless you're a Youtuber and you wanna make some Funtages out of it, there's No reason to do it! And yeah, if you're a new player expect a LOT , but a LOOOOT of these f**kers around. 7) Game un-balance. Cheaper guns are way better than Expensive ones! 2.700$ 1-shot kill and 3.100$ 2-shot kill in the Head! Not to mention 500$ Tec-9 at close range! As much as the Prices are so close to Realism, gameplay is NOT! I can say that I used to have fun games 2 years ago, made a lot of friends from this game, bad as the time goes by, this game is dying and Valve is responsible for this! If a whole game company doesn't care for a game they made, that is the Most populated they ever made, then there's no reason to keep playing it!  If you're a new player , or even if you're thinking of getting this game, DON'T DO IT! Get some more money, and spend them on other games, or even Free2Play games that are actually WAY better than this... Or even just buy yourself a good MacDonalds meal.

The rank system is a joke.Overwatch is a joke.VAC is a joke.There is no anti-cheat system for this game.It has a tired engine. (2004) Source engineIt's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone  other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people  hence people having so many accounts...I have 1 account and proud of it.I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux.You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed.For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !This game would be great........

3975784b-1016-4720-96fd-5288188576f0,7,"First of all I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood but not everything is fine and dandy and I will address some of these issues in my review. First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka:Screenshot of the comment: http://imgur.com/a/i80j3Comment: 'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'My Response: 1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).  6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game.

I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more.However, I have to play this game:1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance, 2.

IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure.

fced8234-23f1-48c8-9452-627e15e9d167,8,"Well hi and thanks for stopping by.After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO.If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull.What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more.",Mon Jul 06 21:30:26 EEST 2020,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

Which is why you get useless/boring updates (operation hydra)8. Valve only care about the money 9. Valve don't listen to the community who could make the game so much better but instead they put alot more money into dota 2...10. And finally but almost obvious... Valve's VAC system on csgo is just as terrible as the community.,Mon Jun 14 18:16:13 EEST 2021,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50
d3a6ec90-dde1-4182-ab08-844322859835,3,"The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual goddamned casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts!

Just Cause 3 is an amazing sequel to its predecessor, keeping what made Just Cause 2 so much fun and increases it by 100%. The level of chaos and destruction is very impressive, and you will never run out of fun blowing things up, even if its all you spent the last 8 hours doing. However, this game does fall short where the previous instalment shined: the story. While the last story was very straightforward and well explained throughout, this game doesn't really follow that, and just send you from point a to b just to 'blow stuff up', never having much character development or surprises.
The Graphics are beautiful, from the nice, Mediterranean beaches to the alps in the largest island of the map, you always feel like what you are looking at is a piece of art.
The Gameplay feels nice and smooth, the addition of the wingsuit was a stroke of genius, as it works really well as a mode of quick travel. This made Just Cause 2 feel slower and the general slog from area to area has been significantly reduced.
Music isnt really anything special, although there is always a perfect background track for the moment, especially in combat.
Overall, Just Cause 3 is a blast to play as its enjoyable from start to end. Some crashes appear from time to time, and seem to know exactly when is most inconvenient for the game to crash. Still, playing this game is a must, as it is just so much fun!
Just Cause 3 gets an 8/10.

But the point of this review system is to let people who haven't bought it know about what they're getting in to. That's why I don't recommend it. If you jump into casual to learn the ropes and play with other people there's a 90% you'll get kicked because you don't know how to play, didn't defuse the bomb because you don't know where it is, or maybe you'll get kicked just because someone called a vote for no reason and everyone hit F1 because it's a funny me me to kick people for no reason. You'll get abused over mic and text chat constantly until you ""git gud"", and then even when you do it will still continue.If you play competitve to try and get better and progress through the skill ranks there's a 90% chance you will get yelled at continuously if you are last alive, pointing out everything you do wrong in their eyes, even though they are already dead.This games community is absolutely terrible and while there are nice people that just want to have fun or help out new people, they are a dime a dozen.If you think you'll be fine with all this go right ahead and buy it, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling when you can play, and even moreso when you do those pro™ strats™.

How to be racist and sexist.4. How to be spoiled as ♥♥♥♥.5. How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch.6. How to be disappointed in human beings.7. How to socialise in a civilised and calm manner (/s).And last but not least, how to be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason at all.Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game.

All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge.

Couldn't type anymore.So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad. FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :DBut don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) ",Fri May 07 08:42:37 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

I was only able to play on iMac the past one and half year. February 2016, I finally built up my first gaming PC. On March 2st 2016, I got invited to IEM ESL KATOWICE 2016 (Also called ICK 2016, the CS:GO female tournament) with Team Elysium Female. BEST TRIP IN MY LIFE. 14年第一次看的比赛是科隆，15年初我在斗鱼转播高清的卡托比赛。那时候主播很少，妹子也没有。虽然看不太懂，但是就是觉得很好看。半夜四点起来就转播比赛，然后用着小银条的技术""解说“比赛。观看的人很多，弹幕也被刷的满满的，想想就超级激动。还记得是Fnatic拿了冠军，那天yicofan也在qq里和直播间里一直跟我看。已经不再怎么玩游戏的我，一辈子都没有想到整整一年后，居然是和妹子还有yicofan站在卡托的决赛舞台前观看比赛。。。那个画面，真的一辈子都忘不了。。。也谢谢你们给我的这个机会因为CSGO相识后面基的好友：榛子Hazel，曾哥Yicofan，大眼睛，维维Timing，乔阿姨大哥SAGA，大橙子，小鱼儿tingtian :2017stickypopsicle:坐等面基喜+1",Mon Jan 03 15:06:02 EET 2022,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

8c181252-e949-43cf-8775-ce72dfa9b319,3,"CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend.",Mon Apr 05 13:43:30 EEST 2021,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

Low ranks are a bottomless pit with no escape unless you get a whole new account due to smurfs, trolls, hackers and people who are idiots. Loss after loss forever, versus 5 cued smurfs on the other team or hackers.So you would think, after spending CASH on this game, that I would be able to play with my friends, right? I bought the game for that.Nope! You have to play 5 hours of casual. During which, people micspam racist music and other things, act toxic, insult, etc.After that- Things will get better, right? Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game. Why would Valve increase the price of their game or IP ban hackers? The hackers buy the game for $15 again and again, to troll 2 to 4 matches, then get banned, and repeat. And repeat. So why would they stop if it makes them money?I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs.Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right?Nopity Nope! You get banned for a full 24 hours FOR WINNING. You have to sit there AND WAIT and can't play comp again!Add a new paypal account? Great- you can't trade items for 6 days!Just got the game? Great! You can't sell or buy items for a full month!Everything about this game treats new players like they're cheaters/hackers/smurfs/trolls, while allowing experienced players to do those things with little effort. Very steep learning curve that is not helped in most ways, very toxic community, very fustrating game mechanics, server performance getting worse every day- rubber banding at 65 ping, if you have more than 250ms ping you teleport all over the map and can do nothing at all, and on top of it all- you get banned just for WINNING.

For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that.

(Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!Neutrals:(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.",Fri Jul 23 09:27:44 EEST 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games.Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun.BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"".After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others.You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review.I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?!I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do.To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers.This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve!And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"".So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system.This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture.You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins.This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame.By the way:Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system.Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days....",Tue Jun 30 16:07:00 EEST 2020,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

Netcode and servers are horrible.VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life?

3a965052-c044-47f4-ba4c-618aff471aa8,0,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive used to be a great game, but constant bad updates and the toxic playerbase have ruined it. The competitive aspect used to seem like a good thing, but people take this game way too seriously and will lash out at you if you do anything even slightly wrong, and then on the other hand there are people who don't take it seriously enough and join competitive games just to annoy the people who take it seriously. There is no balance to this, you will hardly ever find a good team that you enjoy playing with.Maps - There may seem like a decent selection of maps to choose from, but there are only a select few which actually get played, and those are the old maps which most people have played thousands of times so it may be hard to get into, you may even feel discouraged.Not P2W - This game isn't pay to win, there are only weapon/glove skins which are purely cosmetic or different knives which ultimately all do the same thing, there has been a lot of controversy in the past about this kind of system being available to kids, there are cases where children steal their parents credit card just to buy skins.Many of the recent updates over the past year or so have been garbage, with many maps being added which almost never get played after a week, along with glove skins and other items so that valve can make money. I feel like this game has been abandoned by the developers, and now they primarily use it as another way to make easy money, completely disregarding the loyal playerbase and professional players.Smurfs (an experienced player using a new account to face lower ranks) and hackers are a pretty big problem in this game, and despite valves many failed attempts at combating the issue almost nothing has changed. Valves anti-cheat is garbage, and if you do end up getting this game, I would reccomend either faceit or ESEA, because their anti-cheat is a lot better and you generally face better players than if you were to play regular competitive.Although this game used to be a lot of fun to play competitively with friends, I can not reccomend it in it's current state, in my eyes this game is dying and after putting just over 1000 hours into it, I am ready to never play it again.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)",Wed Mar 03 14:03:10 EET 2021,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

I sometimes break my table but its ok, my mammy always gets me stuff so im good.

No need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving.

Not just in Silver league, where people either troll constantly even if you're top fragging and you're the only one actually trying, hacking or smurfing from much higher ranks.Every game makes me angry. I play against LEM smurfs, Globals smurfs, even the good ol' Silver Elite Master smurfs who still manage to destroy everyone. I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts. Nothing I have said so far has been hyperbolized, this is actually how the game is now.Hackers not getting banned. Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry. Next thing you know you're being body blocked all over the place and the only thing you can do is beg for a kick. I don't even have 200 hours on this account yet and the past 20-30 have been nothing but the same puerile crap. 30 year old adults acting like babies.

Then I meet the 3 types of players I just talked about. Not to mention that after the game is over, you're glad because you get the part ways and play another game with other players that won't give you a hard time. Oh wait, no you don't. You get matched up with the very same players over and over again unless you take a 20 minute break to ensure that you truly meet other players. And the cycle continues.This is not fun.

Don't think for a second you'll get the same games and players you see on the pro players' videos on youtube, because you sure as hell will not. This game is no longer enjoyable. I know that I am bad and that's why I'm not Gold Nova let alone Silver 3. But at least I actually try to play the game, to communicate and teach the basics to the ones that are new to this game.

Its the type of game that could draw empathy from Satan himself. Aloy is the protagonist we all deserve to have in an open world game. The game play options are great for those who want an easy pass in combat or for those who want a more difficult challenge. The photo mode is way ahead of its time, putting Red Dead Redemption to shame and many other A List games. The graphics on my RTX 3060 are amazing set at ultra 4K.

I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates.

373f69f1-b65b-40d8-88bd-8476e1c2f36f,8,"The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.",Fri Feb 05 08:37:30 EET 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot.Graphics 8/10The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.Sound and voice acting 10/10Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the ""Terrorists Win"" and ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYET"" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!Game physics 8/10Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)Community 6/10Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH!

d876e4a7-60a6-4ac1-9061-581b4df747c5,8,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical competitive first person shooter.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.

I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank. If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned.

830edb8d-ee31-4d90-a6b0-5b57a7d41705,5,The Game is more worried about making $$$ and making skins which in turn = more $$$. Then getting rid of the cheaters and people that exploit the game. The only thing that was remotely fun about the game was the skin trading. You could get some skins then trade them up and sometimes get a skin worth enough $$$ to sell on the steam market to buy a new game. But now if you start with a 2-3$ skin and you want to trade your way up to a knife or another skin it will take years only being able to trade a skin every 7 days.

Otherwise, this game is UTTER GARBAGE.The matchmaking is so broken that I can't even describe it. Even if it might seem balanced, you only get to play a ""balanced"" game 1 every 20-30 games, and even then there's a pretty high chance you'll end up with one of the following people: a retard, a russian who doesn't speak english, a troll, a hacker.The rest of the games are either 16:1 in your favor, or 1:16 against you. And trust me, the ones you lose with scores like 10:16 are the worst games, cause this game TRULY gets the best out of you. For instance, if you play for about 3 hours CS, you'll need around 4 to let the tension this game creates blow off. It's unreal! If I have to spend time in online multiplayer games, it will definitely not be CS:GO, LOL, DOTA2 and other multiplayer teamgames, cause the community and the vast majority of the playerpool (around 80%) IS GARBAGE.

You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform. Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player.Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything.You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings.At it's core CS:GO is a solid competitive team FPS with a lot of gameplay depth, good map pool, active playerbase and lots to learn and room to improve yourself. There's just many little pitfalls. I think a lot of people will end up spending more time on this game than they initially expected. I don't know if I'd recommend it.

3c174795-860e-4ecc-8439-878282c95e47,8,"After several hours in this game, all I can say is that this game has the absolute worst community I have EVER SEEN in my entire life, and worse than Call of Duty's, Battlefield's, PAYDAY 2's, Team Fortress 2's, or Left 4 Dead's.CS:GO's community is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the gaming community.You get insulted by either your teammates or the enemy team for EVERY little thing, on Casual, and ESPECIALLY in Competitive, and you can't mute them either because you have to somehow find some useful information that's buried underneath the childish and immature insults from these manchildren and kids that love talking♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't physicallly punch them in the face in real life because of distance.The virginity, girlfriendless, sexism (I've seen really immature and horny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that prey on girls, and I've also seen stupid, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attention seeking girls on this game as well that bait guys), anti-social, fanboyism, nerdism, sociopathy, childishness, manchildishness, and immaturity are at maximum here in this game.Then there's these clutch or kick nerds that can't ever give you a ♥♥♥♥ing chance and are constantly pressuring you and cause you to fail, then they put up a votekick against you and kick you out for losing ONE round even though you're most likely leading and carrying the entire team, and winning the match as well, and it's worse if you're in a Competitive match when this happens because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown system, which is another issue with this game. You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so goddamn much to you.And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community.",Fri Feb 12 06:41:56 EET 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

About 80% (maybe more) of my games I played with Russians was pure cancer. They didn't speak English, just &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥"" and other sh*ts.  This also applies with kids - I don't know, how many times I heard 11/12 yo kids who f*cked my mother, funny :), isn't it? You can have a good score, like 36/15, you can win 9 rounds on harder side, you can sacrifice your soul to win, but still, with team score 14/9 on better side you can LOSE. Why, because they aren't able to do something good. Situations, when they want to kick you:They want to kick you, if you don't clutch 1v5.They want to kick you, if you don't speak their language.They want to kick you, if you are 30 seconds AFK. They want to kick you, if you are ahead of them.They want to kick you, if you are behind them. ( mostly if  they use only P90)They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun.AND STORY CONTINUES........I really recommend to find a friends and play together.SKINSIn game you can buy skins. Nice, you can ""upgrade"" your game how you want. But there fun ENDS. Do you want some beauty skin on an USP? - Pay about 5€!Do you want some beauty skin on M4/AK47? - Pay 10+€!Do you want some beauty skin on an AWP? - Pay  20+€!NOT ENOUGH? Do you want some beauty skin on Knife? -♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet and bank account and PAY 300+€!!No, I am not kidding. 300€ for pixels into game, that costs 10€. Ridiculous? Yes, I know. VALVE's RANKING SYSTEMAnother thing you should know until you start play competetive. Believe me, rank in this game doesn't show your right skill. There are a lot of boosted accounts. You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.VALVE ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM (VAC) Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets. SMURFSMaybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man. So, you want check out his profile, clearly for sure and then you see: Lvl 1 profile without avatar, only with 1 game - CS:GO with about 60/100 hours on it. I don't get, why do they create new Steam profile, buy CS:GO and play against weaker players. They gotta to kill lower ranks to get a higher ego? Why do they not play on FACEIT/ESEA? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, if you want to get the cancer, but you dont even smoke and these included cons don't matter for ya - BUY IT! :)But the game itself is great :)MY OVERAL RATING - 5/10",Mon Apr 19 13:08:19 EEST 2021,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

The details of the game, the same since the year 2000, bring such minute differences between the skilled and the amateur that the skill ceiling is nearly unreachable.

- Boring main quests.
- Repetitive side quests.
- Characters do not have facial expression consistent with the emotions of the speeches.

8cd8075d-9afe-4c7c-9196-7d2feeed8280,9,"Disclaimer: This review is pretty much spoiler free!

I went into this game not really expecting much. I watched one review and was like ""yeah whatever"". Granted at the moment I have a hard time finding fun in games. It takes me a lot of effort to even be excited and only a few games wake the ""child"" in me again. This one definitely did. Literally the first game I got 100% and one of the only games I was so hooked I played the story twice (only a handful of games have given me that experience in my life). Of course the game is not perfect but it does a really dang good job. I am glad this was a PC port because I'm kinda sad that exclusives exist, especially when they're so amazing. Also there are barely any glitches or bugs anymore so don't worry (it had a problem when it released to PC)

Pro's:
+ Map: is huge, magical and beautiful. Very diverse with different biomes that flow into each other perfectly. Weather changes, day/night cycle, natural wildlife creates a rich environment that feels natural. 
+ Story: keeps you interested. There are quite a lot of mysterys that cant really be guessed upfront but get explained through the story. Side Quests fill in further gaps and almost all Quests are more or less unique. It doesn't feel like an endless grind of repetitiveness. 
+ Protagonist: Strong female character that actually has a personality unlike this woke bs institutions like Hollywood are trying to push. She has her positives and negatives which make for a rich character. The game builds a very emotional attachment to her and the story itself I felt infatuated with finding out what's next.
+ In Game Characters: There are a handful of unique and prominent characters that you remember and make the story more tangible.
+ Weapons/Armour/Enemies: Without Spoilering too much there are a TON of enemies each having their own unique behaviour/moveset, stronger version of themselves that can be fought differently, abusing their weaknesses with your weapons. Actually at a certain size of enemy pretty much every encounter feels like a boss battle where you need to pull up a different strategy which I just love. There are quite a few weapons to choose from that make you in control on how you want to approach said enemy. Armour can also be modified specifically for a certain use (damage taker, stealth etc.)
+ Eye for detail: There are a lot of easter eggs and even just decoration of areas you wouldnt normally be able to reach. Some of them are included in quests, some can be found by exploring. 

Cons:
- Facial animations / Voices: They don't feel as natural when it's not focused on Aloy (protagonists). When you don't look closely it's barely noticeable but at times you really see most of the effort was put into Aloy. Which definitely makes sense.
- Some animations: Are a bit ... annoying? Sometimes the character won't grab onto a ledge or your character doesn't move fluently so it sometimes fucks up what you wanted to do.
- Passing through: Something that I despised that was an intended function was if you wanna pass through a group of robots they still started to attack or put you into fight mode. Would be cool if there was some way the game detected you're just passing through so you wont be noticed and can just continue. It was fun at first but if you wanna just enjoy the scenery and get from A to B it can get annoying real quick.

I'm sure I've forgotten some things but in the end I'm happy I got to experience this. I hope the next Horizon game will come to PC eventually as well and I hope they dont fuck it up like many big studios did with their follow up games recently as they were just too confident instead of trying to love their work and impress the players. I'd much rather pay 70 bucks for a game like this than COD which is the same shit every year (recently even with less features). Because this shows there was love behind it. Thought. Dedication. Not empty promises like Cyberpunk2077. 

Thank you Guerrilla Games for this masterpiece and I hope to see more amazing things in the future :)

It's a problem since they're not random, so you're forced to learn them if you want to compete, because everyone else knows them. So in those situations where you want to hold down the fire button for longer than 1 second during close range combat and go for a headshot, you have to aim at their feet, then a little to the left, then the right. It's incredibly frustrating.

Here it goes: you're playing a match defending a bombsite on the Terrorist side. Mr. L33t is carefully watching the bombsite's right flank as a sniper. An enemy player suddenly appears, who also has a sniper rifle. Mr. L33t and the enemy player try to one shot each other. Since you don't want to peak the sniper and get killed insantly, you hang back at the bomb site and play it smart like your other teammates.

He can approach you from multiple sides. You have two choices to approach this situation:A: You can take a risk and look for him, and if you're lucky enough, kill him. However, the downside to this decision is that if you end up dying, Mr. L33t will say ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE CAMPED!B: You can continue hiding in the same spot and hope to ambush them. However, if the enemy player has a good guess that you're hiding in that spot, he will prefire the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and kill you.

Or he will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you for not prefiring, even though if you did, you would never have hit the enemy player and instead give away your exact position, so even though the enemy player had a guess of where you're hiding, now he knows for sure. So which choice is the right choice? None, because you never had a chance to kill him in the first place and would die regardless. Meanwhile, Mr. L33t will be busy telling the whole team to join his circle jerk of hate, because clearly you are a bad player for not being able to kill him.You could, of course, tell Mr. L33t that if he were such a good player, he would have killed him long before it even became a problem, but it's clearly not his fault because he's the most important snowflake on this team. And remember the last round he tried to clutch as the last player? Yeah, he didn't clutch that match either, and he did far worse than you at it, but he decided to ♥♥♥♥♥ at his teammates anyway for not giving him proper call outs, even though that's exactly what you did. What did this guy do? He didn't give you ANY call outs. You know what's worse than playing on a team with Mr. L33t? Playing a game with 2 or more Mr. L33ts. Let the vote kick commence, but it's not like having them kick you off the team will make any difference because they're going to lose the competitve game anyway.2) Mic Spamming Mikey, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound loops, songs, memes, and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS in a comp match who wonders why the team can't hear any callouts.You would think Mic Spamming Mikey is a troll, but unlike other mic spammers, Mikey is taking this game half-seriously, so he's putting in some effort to win, although it's not much, mind you...Basically Mikey thinks everyone enjoys the BS he ♥♥♥♥♥ out of his mic, because listening to his stupid songs that have lyrics like ""touch muh wang wang"" and ""I'm so fresh you can suck muh nuts"" are clearly more important than listening to callouts. Nobody's going to be able to hear call outs with loud volume like that. Then comes the moment where a teammate dies, then Mikey says ""OMFG HOW COULD YOU NOT HEAR THE CALLOUTS? VOTEKICK!"" It's even worse if Mikey turns out to have the same personality traits that Mr. L33t has.3) Jackass Jimmy, the idiot with no sense of awareness.Jackass Jimmy isn't a noob. He's been playing this for a while. However, he still plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so he has absolutely no excuse to be an idiot. Jackass Jimmy still doesn't know call outs, recoil patterns, the difference between camping and rushing, and a whole lot of other obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥that you need to know. Jackass Jimmy is the type of person to hear someone say ""They're rushing B! They 're rushing B!"" and still stay at bombsite A because he doesn't know how to read a map. He's the type of person to fire a gun full auto at point blank range and still not kill his intended target. He's the type of person to buy an auto sniper, only to miss every shot with it and give the enemy team a generous donation of an OP weapon after getting killed.Jackass Jimmy isn't even trying at this point.4) Trolling Tommy and Backup BillyTrolling Tommy likes to troll competitive games just to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. He'll do anything to get on your nerves, whether it's purposely playing like♥♥♥♥♥♥ getting in your face to keep you from using your gun, flashing your teammates, ""accidentally"" teamkilling you, spinning around in spawn, and a whole list of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Naturally, such behavior warrants a quick and hasty votekick, but not for Trolling Tommy. You see, Trolling Tommy always comes with another equally stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥called Backup Billy. Backup Billy also likes to troll the game, but he prefers to blend in with the crowd and act like he's not part of it. Backup Billy's job is to keep Tommy from getting votekicked, so he'll always vote no. He'll lie and tell you he voted yes, then blame it on someone else.5) Hacking Harley, the hacking piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from the enemy team who keeps you from winning.In most circumstances, hacker accusations are unfounded and usually are wrong. However, in cases where there clearly is a hacker in your competitive mach, Hacking Harley just loves to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with their aimbot, wall hacks, spinbot, whatever. Forget having their team votekick them. Those guys want a quick and easy win. Enjoy losing a competitive match that could have easily been won by you if everyone played fair and square.6) Mr. SaltyMr. Salty has a temper like Mr. L33t, but Mr. Salty doesn't brag about how good he is. Instead, he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over trivial things. He will team kill his teammates for accidentally shooting him, making the whole team lose the match. He'll get angry at you for trying to give him advice. Mr. Salty is the type of person who has been on a losing streak in the past couple of matches so anything will♥♥♥♥♥♥him off. P.S.Casual matches would also be more enjoyable if we didn't have the following idiots:1) Mic Spamming Mikey (he's a full blown troll here)2) Tryhard Johnson - this guy is just like Mr. L33t, except he's even ♥♥♥♥♥ier and treats casual like a competitive game. He won't give new players the chance to learn and will vote kick them on the spot if they make a mistake they can afford to make. You know, because it's casual, and people try to get practice out of it...",Tue Apr 27 20:05:31 EEST 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

Why would you make a BR game out of this iconic franchise is beyond me.You could have just made a second br game using source engine and put another dev team on it,insted you focused your resources on a mode that nobody asked for.   Danger zone plays and feels like an indie battle-royale,cs mechanics feel weird and out of place in a genre like that.Also most of the time youre using SMG's ,pistols and shotguns which,in my opinion,lowers skill ceiling drastically.On top of that - map becomes boring and repetitive after a few games because it looks like its made in 2007 with first stable source build valve released.Last operation was over a year ago and all this time youve been working on this?!?!?Why?WTF...Valve always values community feedback ,for example - overwatch,reddit,forums,workshop etc. , but this time nobody asked for this,if anything, people were sceptical.So why would you,in a right state of mind,start working on something so controversial and uncharacteristic to cs as a god damn BR...   Now about prime and CS:GO becoming f2p...♥♥♥♥ valve.Cheater problem was bad as it is,but now since you can buy prime cheaters are going to ruin even more games because nothing stands in their way,and I dont even want to imagine all the casual PUB's which are gonna be unplayable.Even if you get eventually detected,you can simply make another account and continue cheating,there is completely 0 penalty for doing so.    This company built all this hype around a terrible update.I was hoping for Matchmaking rework,introduction of seasons and rewards,something fun ,a goal for the casual players,maybe 128 tick servers or an operation because valve was working on something BIG...Now its all gone,they are going to focus on BR  mode,update and tweak it.Because of that cs as we know will stagnate even more and eventually  perish.Thanks for spliting your dev team even more,i look forward for the next update in 2022.Thanks volvo :)RIP CSGO 6/12/2018goodnight,sweet prince...",Mon Sep 27 18:42:55 EEST 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

94e1f7d7-4130-4430-bb10-73b56fcffa74,7,"Until Valve come up with a better matchmaking method (with almost 4 years since the release, I'd say there are no such plans) you'll be better off wasting your time and emotional balance elsewhere. Competitive is crowded with smurfs, poisonous jerks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who find it amusing to ruin their team's match on purpose, cheaters and kids. To be fair, kids are probably the most pleasant group to play with cause they mostly try to play well, even if they can't. If you play really, really well - you may be able to ignore the first 2 groups. The rest will still be there.My biggest complaint towards competitive gameplay is that reporting people doesn't do much, especially reporting for offensive voice / text chat - it's always been merely a placebo button. Global Offensive jokes aside, you cannot imagine how fed up I am with people losing their♥♥♥♥♥♥when I say I am Russian, even if I carry the game and never insult anyone or talk about politics. I'm not going to lie about my nationality to play with a bunch of ignorant frustrated teenagers. What’s funniest – all of that mostly comes from other Europoors who everyone else would confuse with Russians anyway.Top it up with all the more frequent lags, server instability and general lack of communication from devs on server downtimes and updates, and you’ll have CS:GO. It doesn’t mean you can’t still enjoy this game or that I will stop playing it. It’s just very hard to do so unless you play in a full premade team and rank in the top 25% at least.",Sat Oct 17 21:05:57 EEST 2020,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6
94e1f7d7-4130-4430-bb10-73b56fcffa74,0,"I can't recommend this game after playing +650 hours, the community isn't supportive or fun to play with anymore, the skins and ""mission books"" are just a way to keep making money off the same product that a very large community bought. Source use to be fun when you hop into a server and you may or may not find the random a$$hole, but most people where very accepting and use to actually have great conversations and great games...but now its full of intense competitiveness that just makes people upset if you don't do exactly what they tell you when they tell you, even if you do what they tell you they will figure out a way that its still somehow your fault and not theirs at all.I do like competitive, but people (and trolls) need to lighten up. I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game. Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community.UPDATE 05/10/2016:The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same. Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it.UPDATE 09/30/2016:I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people.UPDATE 11/12/2016:Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all. I'm going to ask for my money back because this is one of the worst community's to play with along with poor updates and consistently making non-broken maps more broken/""balanced"". I have been playing on and off for years now and it looks like I may stay off this game for forever because of this toxic, unsupportive cretins and terrible company/dev updates that (again) don't help with stupid updates that don't improve the game, just their wallets.UPDATE 03/07/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY):Yet again just wanted to kill time, go on for a few casual matches and (as a terrorist) CT's have nothing but awps, autos and negevs for 4 matches in a row!!! Not rounds, games...different matches...same people, same sides, same guns. Literally not worth playing anymore...literally I don't know why I bother anymore. Again, don't buy. You're better off buying ANYTHING ELSE but this terrible time waster. I know this review is long, but it's been a small reminder over the last 9 months of on and off play to just stay away, the only reason I keep coming back is just a time filler. Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games. I still personally don't recommend this game, but if you choose to buy it, have fun I guess :PUPDATE 09/07/17:Literally trash. Would though away if I could. All awpers in casual, no fun in competative...its a terrible game. Don't buy it.UPDATE 06/01/18:Full of A.D.H.D., nothing but office, dust 2 and some other over played ♥♥♥♥♥♥ map.",Tue Jul 28 02:44:18 EEST 2020,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

Never got notified that they got banned as i got once when i had 50 hours. Now I lose every round because i have to carry or enemy is damn good, I dont get good teamates as I would love to, they are too bad for me or 2 strong so i cant get any kills. I hate when i join game and in first half 2 of my teamates leave game. Anything isnt better with Trust mode that was added... I dont get wtf new dust 2 map is, it looks like you just used some parts of Office ( T spawn? ), Inferno ( B site), and Italy + Canals. Tunnels look almost same as tunnels in Aztec, I have to say that my fps isnt that bad for me like for other players it is, I usually have about 45-60fps in dust 2 40-50fps ( And that isnt very bad because I learned how to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop. ) Other thing I have to say for Nuke that has 25-35fps which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and what the hell is minimap and bomb sound on Nuke. I am at B site in doors room ( idk its name but its nice to hide ), and I hear bomb like it is 2 meters from me. I told my teamate that bomb is on B and after about 20 seconds we realized that it is on A... but it was too late gg wp.♥♥♥♥♥♥mapAztec got removed from game and there is achievment that says "" Win 100 rounds on Aztec "". What fu*king idiot removed Aztec and Vertigo from game. Maps werent balanced, true, but that isnt reason to remove them from game. And I dont get it why you dont bring them back with message "" We added removed maps to game because community wanted it. "" And why would you like to remove maps from competitive and make players unhappy? So people have more time to buy skins? Or write long reviews like I am doing now? You are just ruining the game with new updates. And about skins, almost all csgo profit comes from skins because some rich Americans have to buy Dragon Lore ( no hate ). Just imagine war with painted guns, unrealistic. You made skin market with in game inspect from nice tactical FPS game. And knife in game costs 5 more times then real life knife, you are just making people an idiots.Today I playied vs spinboter on Cache, and best thing is that hacker had 1400 gours in game. Idk, maybe he got hack when he had 1200 or 1300 hours, but after 200 hours in game (I just guess) this guy is still playing and ruining other people's fun. After all stupid things and toxic enemies who say ""ez ez ez"" when they win competitive match, especially if they have less kills then worst guy in my team. Also I got kicked for being the best one in game with 32 kills and ofc I got derank... All at all, I hate it because it isnt good balanced. And BOTs arent listening, I dont care about your stupid new shootgun update, like anybody will use shootguns they are sh#t in csgo and cost too much, so could you make BOTs listen and not die in first 20 seconds of the match...but no, shootguns are the most important thing ...I playied Wingman cuz I was bored and I dont get its new ranking system, something changed... Firstly I won 2 games in a row and after that lost and BOOM! I deranked to gn4 from mg1. After that I lost one more time and deranked to gn3, wow!!! After that thingie I won 3 matches and got no rankup and after that lost 1 match and deranked to gn2... WHAT THE F#Ck ?!?!?!?!?!?! I guess this is one more of VALVE'S briliant updates where you cant rankup up in Wingman and can derank if you lose only one match, Im not joking. This is for real and I dont know what is going on, I got matched against silvers as mg1 and that is reason for sure... but those guys play better then some of my friends that are mg2 or mg elite in Wingman... I swear.... They have less then 100 hours and play awesome. Well that is why I deranked wow... I wasnt playing csgo about 1 month, cuz its absolute bulls#it in my opinion. And that is the reason why game gave me to play vs silvers, I guess... and now I have Gold Nova 2 instead of MG1 with win/lose=10 ^_^Also when griefers are in my team they kill me and other teamate and just leave with 30 minutes ban, they got 30 minutes ban and we lost our ranks. That is fu*king nice Valve, fu*king nice. And after griefers leave in 3rd round, later result is 14 - 4 (for enemy)  I abandoned the match and got 24 hour ban. Well yes... Again fu#king nice Valve.One more time I got trolls in team, I found a nice chance to kick 2 of them because other 2 got kicked after they killed me on the start of first 2 rounds. After I kicked 2 of them It was 5v1 and I surrendered. When I came to lobby it said I'm banned for 7 days ""you kicked to many players""?!?!?!?... fu#k you and your stupid game!!!PS: I'm silver elite now and I was silver elite master after 20 hours in game.

4f78db41-952f-43dd-bb94-618ee5a44f86,6,"Can't recommend it. Utterly horrid.Judging from the experience I had with this game, the community is the first crucial hole in it. Especially if you're a poor russian sod, who bought this game because your friend recommended you to do so. You'll be kicked from the server, just because guys from other countries thought that your drunk vodka dances wasn't good enough. That always grinds my gears.The gameplay is repetitive and there's nothing to talk about. I'm sure you've played it and know what i mean.Since I haven't much played it lately, there seems to be new payable merch were implemented, like: gloves, something about premium-accounts and ect. If the game tries to show the conflict between SWAT and mujaheddins, let's first get rid of the colored guns and gloves, because on the real war you won't be using any skins to show off to your mates. Soldiers on the war don't usually do that♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they have an objective to destroy the enemy forces, not showing off. The whole concept of skins seems very odd and doesn't fit in a game about the war conflicts. Also, I like the phrase ""Shop for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Merchandise"" on the Steam store page.The summary.I can't belive I spent over 300 hours in this game. The addiction that you might get from this is worse than drug addiction. Just for god sake, don't buy it.

THe developers of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game do not give two butt♥♥♥♥s about the players, they care only about money. Instead of making this game better and fixing bugs, they add cases and sprays. At times, I question why I I still play this god awful excuse of a game. The one great thing about this community was the ability to gamble your skins, and ecspecially csgolounge. Not only did valve attempt to fully cease operations on gambling sites, they also took down csgolounge, the biggest and most reliable betting site of them all (also a personal favorite of mine). On top of these horrific displays of costumer servive by valve, they also have a ranking system that is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow that i could litterally rank up faster in the actual U.S. military. And dont even get me started about the god damn morons you find in matchmaking. I often find that 99 out of 100 of my teammates that i am randomly get queud with are absoulutely brain dead, and have little to no knowledge about the game and how it functions. Now on to a very important issue that is troubling our community, the grill (girl) population is extremely scarce, you could imagine my frustration as a man trying to get in some dank phone sex after a compettitive match. Not only this, but it seems as though the grills that are playing csgo, 1. pay no attention to my extremely rushed and desperate advances toward them. 2. grills also seem to be treated like gods in this game, (even though they are all really ♥♥♥♥ing bad) and almost always have extremely expensive inventories. And on to my final issue with this game, the man who runs the show.... yup, thats right, im talking about you Gaby boy. Gaben, also known as gay piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥fan boy obese nerd online legend real life loser-having♥♥♥♥♥Gaben has slowly destroyed this game, due to the constant uploads of new cases and operations, just so that fat bastard can get some more cash from twelve year olds around the world.

29086715-8f45-488e-a6b8-a8e3780a5488,1,"Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10.",Thu Dec 05 11:23:49 EET 2019,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

29086715-8f45-488e-a6b8-a8e3780a5488,5,"The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first. ",Sun Jun 09 20:57:20 EEST 2019,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f
29086715-8f45-488e-a6b8-a8e3780a5488,7,"I cannot recommend CS:GO.Valve lacks adequate transparency in rectifying the ongoing issues present within CS:GO (i.e. cheats, game play performance, etc.). Additionally, the crawl to level 21 (i.e. a requirement to play prime account matchmaking, which slightly decreases cheating encounters) is grueling given that the number of cheaters in non-prime results in slowed leveling; competitive matchmaking consistently provides the highest XP reward, which is dependent on rounds won. Valve relies on a peer review system (i.e. Overwatch) to punish potential cheaters, which serves as a do-it-yourself solution that is supplemented with VAC (i.e. an ineffective anti-cheating solution). Cheaters are not deterred as an overwatch conviction commonly results in the individual obtaining an alternate account. Despite Valve’s profit margins being nourished by superfluous additions (stickers, temporary graffiti, skins, music kits, etc.) the game has been lacking substantial content in the form of Operations, which are accompanied by new maps. The previous operation occurred almost a year ago, which far exceeds the average time between the last six operations of five weeks. Also, the gaming community is vitriolic - there are countless incidents of bigotry, griefing, etc. – it's a Sisyphean struggle of always wanting to expect the best out of CS:GO before being unfailingly reminded of its shortcomings. After nearly 1000 hours, I was left exhausted and resigned myself to the rampant cheating - I piecemealed together my own cheat using articles from numerous public forums. Expectedly, this resulted in me being overwatch banned after countering a series of cheaters in competitive prime-matched games. This 'other side' does not provide any reprieve - even the slightest tinge of a perceived good play, whether assisted with cheats or not, provokes the veiled hackers. I give up on this game as Valve has long before me.tl;dr                                                         …………………./´¯/)                                                        ………………..,/¯../                                                        ………………./…./                                                        ………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸                                                        ………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\                                                        ……..(‘(…´…´…. ¯~/’…’)                                                        ………\……………..’…../                                                        ……….”…\………. _.·´                                                        …………\…………..(                                                        …………..\………….\… CS:GO Excessive number of cheaters primarily in matchmaking (i.e. indistinct or outright) Lack of substantial content (e.g. 1+ year to release an Operation); however, Valve will occasionally release minor fixes for the existing map pool whether aesthetic or technical Ineffective anti-cheating engine and DIY stopgap (i.e. Overwatch) Vitriolic community and ineffective counter-measures Placebo buttons (i.e. report text / voice abuse)   Low incidence of griefing convictions   Heroes of the Storm adopted an effective abuse system a few months after release – Introducing New Reporting Options and the Silence Penalty[us.battle.net] - why is CS:GO lagging behind?We view any system that generates revenue at the cost of consumer happiness as a broken system that we need to fix - Kyle Davis (Valve) - In-Game Economies in Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 Steam Dev Days 2014 A common occurrence in CS:GO [image.prntscr.com] ",Tue Dec 28 14:24:22 EET 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

I realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing  CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the  servers  where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't  recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS.

Cheating:There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!2. DDOS-ing:I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!3. Smurfing:Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!4. Patches:Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!6. Community:The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.Over all:Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again!

It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working.I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible.

0893f780-a2f1-4a5b-b197-33e876fad98b,1,"Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive",Sat Dec 28 22:00:15 EET 2019,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

8f0fabe9-7777-45b9-b947-aefeba5d0f65,6,"I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team.

If you're gonna read this just know this isn't written completely out of spite, it's just my way of rationalizing how such a decent game can cultivate one of the most horrifyingly sadistic and brutally toxic communities I have ever seen in my 18+ years of gaming.Well, here we go...If you value your time, self-esteem or general sanity, I advise you stay as far away from competitive as possible. Stop. Don't bother. Save yourself the heart condition and stick to casual. Or don't play at all, that would be the optimal choice. This game is a test of character, not just a test of skill, and I will tell you why.This game splits everyone into one of 3 categories of player, the one who is bad at playing but can learn and improve, the expert player who harrasses and belittles all others for not being good enough, and the trash players who votekicks and teamkills reguardless of target or skill. This, of course, is nothing new and is pretty common in all online multiplayer games. The harshness of this game, however startlingly eclipses all other communities I have ever seen, creating a sinkhole of reason and leaving everyone with pure hatred not only for the opposite team, but every single person on their own team.You see, like the snake that consumes it's tail, all players that stick with this game end up reaching the second archetype, who in turn become the harrassers after all the hostility they put up with. They go and become the average player in the game, maybe a youtuber, who baits others into trying the game and constantly filling the quota of targets to harrass and belittle. It's a self sustained cycle that has slowly ramped up since the game first came out in 2012, which I can attest as I have been here since the beginning (my hour count doesn't reflect this, so it doesn't relate).That's not to say this is a bad game, no no no. It's just that the entirety of the community is toxic and spiteful, with about 3/4 of them (a generous measurement I'm sure) that WILL sour the game for you. On the other hand if you somehow fit into this description, then by all means try your luck. I promise you your newly found anger management disorder will find a perfect home in your life.If you've made it this far you're either intrigued by what I've said thus far, or you are skipping to the end to see my point. Well either way here it is:If you really want to play this, whether it's for a friend or personal interest, stick to the casual and more open game modes, otherwise I guarantee that you will not like the outcome. Even if you do decide you like it, you will reach a point where you reassess what you've experienced, the community you've exp[osed yourself to, and eventually decide whether you want to put up with this anymore. It'll be your loss, but also your lesson.",Tue Dec 15 02:14:28 EET 2020,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.",Fri Jul 30 10:07:02 EEST 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

5c2e2dfb-d198-4cd8-8909-0f7a4f1d5ea8,0," Don't play CSGO if you can't tolerate cheaters, racism, hatred amongst players (even your own teammates), and under average servers.  Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.

5c2e2dfb-d198-4cd8-8909-0f7a4f1d5ea8,7,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any enjoyment out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't touchy teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are vastly outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be impossible to do so if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire (which you will see a lot of), I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature almost every time. I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time and the veteran players aren't going to stick around forever, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.Another issue is that in the update cycle for this game, things often end up even more broken than repaired. As of right now there are some serious problems with frame rate drops and hit detection, which you probably imagine would take the highest priority on the developer to-do-list, but no. Skins, cases and all other forms of micro-transactions always take the highest priority. I appreciate that Valve is a business and that their goal is to make money, but nobody is going to stick around to play a broken game when they eventually get fed up of it like I and so many others have. We paid for this game and it is your duty to maintain it and make sure everything works like it's supposed to! On one final personal note, I really wish that there was some kind of option to disable skins in-game and maintain only the default models. They're bloody ugly and ruin the immersion, but this is only a personal gripe.The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community and poor maintenance.Update: As of January 2017, I decided to try playing this game again to see if things have gotten any better. I'm afraid not, it's still in poor condition, hit detection is even worse and the community is still as toxic as ever. But hey, at least the cash-cow is still flowing in the forms of ""Glove Cases"" now, right? Sigh...",Sat Aug 28 02:54:36 EEST 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

Streamers tend to get carried to ranks that they can't play at and then state how they are having a bad day because the people who carried them to that rank can't play with them that day. The lower end players the brand new players tend to buy game hoping to have fun and get trolled all the time.

So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open. So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game.

After all this time and a lot of updates I decided to go for the steam version because I really liked the protagonist. I can not stress enough how immersed I was in this beautiful world. 

The story was absolutely great and highly interesting and goes very deep into questions of our modern world: Artificial Intelligence, Machines, Computer technology- replacing the need of human hands and minds in so many areas. 
The way Guerrilla Games presents this story and delivers explanations, timeline details and character information is absolutely outstanding. The pacing feels a little bit slow in the beginning but makes a lot of sense in regards to the overall story arc. Don`t be fooled by the beautiful aesthetic of this game. The story is actually quite grim and really lets you think about some questions of life and death if you are willing to. The side characters are believable, strongly developed, interesting and highly diverse. 

In terms of gameplay I felt that the combat was super responsive and addictive. The more you try out new weapons and tools the more of a badass machine-killing huntress you become. I felt, that the skill tree was not very impactful though and would have wished for a more diverse approach in regards to RPG elements. (Focus on melee, stealth, bow and arrow, precision kills etc.)  Especially since I have almost unlocked every single skill. 

But nevertheless Aloy is an outstanding character and I am so happy Sony decided to go for a female protagonist for a change.

4aa4a0c9-49d0-4ffe-b852-d1afbc804f68,7,"Counter Strike - a huge franchise from Valve, I mean who hasn't heard of the countless streams, case openings and wizardrys all around this game, right? As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad. Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into? People getting CRAZY about chargeable SKINS that only aesthetically make a difference? You tell me.Anyways, enough of that crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ opinions are opinions, right?Controls are okay, graphics don't matter anyways, teamplay is strong, skill is required, what else to say? I think there are enough reviews about the actual game mechanics other than the critizised points listed above, so let me be your hero and skip that part. I haven't written reviews in a while, so let's end this one as it would fit into the CSGO Community.C yka ♥♥♥♥♥, I'll smoke mid, gg wp.",Tue Nov 10 20:57:17 EET 2020,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f
4aa4a0c9-49d0-4ffe-b852-d1afbc804f68,3,"So, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive... here we are.I have owned this game for over a year and haven't really started playing it until recently.My first impressions of the game were that aiming made completely no sense and that I couldn't understand what a single location call out meant period. I soon left CS GO to go back to other games I was playing at the time such as Dota 2 (another Valve game that has tons of hats) and H1Z1 (a game that has tons of hats because it wants to be like Valve).I recently came back to CS GO and have found a much deeper appreciation for it. While I did promise myself when I first got it that I wouldn't go crazy with buying skins, I recently did binge on getting a skin for every weapon. Most skins however were very cheap and I didn't dare attempt to go after a knife since I suck with sneaking up on people anyway.Now unto the actual review. Through practicing in Team Death Match, I've been learning how to use the weapons a lot more efficiently. I'm still nowhere near good but I do actually understand that tapping rather than spraying tends to result in a lot more people dying. When I'm more advanced at the game I'll begin to study how the spray patterns work in more detail so I'm not only tapping left click for all my shots but utilizing the spray more effectively as well.If you're playing the Casual game modes, I'd say it's fine to solo queue because it's quite laid back.For Competitive I tend to like to queue up with full lobby or with at least 1 other person. It makes it feel more fulfilling to either share in the victory or the defeat together.For anyone on the fence about this game or gave it up after not understanding why none of their bullets ever landed on their targets: This game might go on sale for $7.50 around Christmas time. For this price or even a price near that, it's a must have in my opinion. Don't spray at your targets when you're starting off. If you don't know spray patterns you'll just get destroyed and will barely be able to kill anyone. Always try to tap in an almost even rhythm if possible so your shots will be more accurate. Don't worry about winning or losing in the casual gamemodes(non-competitive). As far as I've realized so far, people may say things such as ""rekt"" or ""get owned"" but in the end your calibrated rank isn't being affected by these types of matches. Use new player friendly weapons when you're beginning such as the P90 when you're playing with friends that are more seasoned when they want to play actual games. When you are on your own or are doing death match rounds, use the trickier weapons such as the AK47 or AWP in situations where ultimately whatever happens people won't care about as much.I hope this was somewhat helpful. I'm still new but I have found a new love for this game. I'm pretty sure that once I start solo queuing in Competitive at some point that it'll be like Dota 2 where none of my team mates will speak English and things will be... interesting. Well with that said, I'm off to play some more CS GO!",Tue Aug 24 13:02:34 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

7d6914b5-418a-4def-bca6-70172c0b81e7,3,"An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.69/420",Wed Dec 01 16:29:29 EET 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages!

Keep playing and the awesome CSGO community will be right there to rip it all to shreds and shove it back in your face. Cheers!That's all.. You may catch a few laughs outta the sh*** I wrote in the past down below, but with this summary my review is now complete. Peace out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)-----Update 1------Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :DGood luck and (try to) have fun!----Update 2-----Thanks for all the responses everyone!The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :DI actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!",Mon Apr 12 02:00:50 EEST 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

The story feels a bit confused. The battles are a bit samey. Ultimately you can stealth your way past the vast majority of (mostly alien) enemies, and it's like you barely have to play at all.

The non-linear approach to working your way through the levels in the original Crysis is gone, hello linear-pathway with specifically pre-determined battles. Boring!

Look, it's not *that bad*, but I wouldn't actively recommend this in its own right, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it over the original Crysis or Crysis: Warhead.

cc73292e-0aa9-4a4a-94e1-edabadf016c8,5,"UPDATE 18/02/2017: New insight on the game. You can read my old review below.Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once.",Sun Jan 05 08:17:31 EET 2020,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

6a1c35a8-87e7-4764-bdae-41e75e2b496e,8,"So long, my good friend, so long... I will miss you terribly.Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game.After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did, while not recommending it to anyone at the same time.Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate.Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites.And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered.Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing: Either play always with others, or lose everything you worked for.Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive.It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement.To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories:Casuals: your usual, run-of-the-mill players that team up with a friend or two, or they even may go alone.Premades: Most CSGO players are going in as teams. But, if you are unlucky and bump to a 4 man premade team, you are screwed in most times. Your every mistake will be exploited and become a reason for your team to flame you hard, or even kick you. Very rarely premades will make you feel like an actual part of the team (and these players are worth adding to your friend list).Smurfs: I like to call them the best players the Bane of Global Offensive. Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost.Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost.Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right, smurf accountsIn other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period.Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible.SPOILER ALERT: never open cases, sell them insteadRATING:Gameplay: 8/10 (non-competitive) 3/10 (competitive)Presentation: 8/10Enjoyment (replacing story): 7/10 (non-competitive) 2/10(competitive)Unique Factor: Community: 3.5/10OVERALL: 6.6/10 (non-competitive) 4.1/10 (competitive)Someone get me a match and some alcohol.

But I am not saying that this is a bad game by any means, i have tons of friends that never play competetive but still love the game. This game is also fun to play with friends on community servers to play common things like surf, mini games, or jailbreak. Even if you dont like the competetive aspect of the game you should still buy it and try it out considering that its only 15 dollars! Another thing that makes this game great is the economy; i've probably made about $25 dollars off the game so far, but also given back about $30 dollars from gun camo's, DLC, and cases, etc...

Okay now you won a weapon with some value YAY you are never going to sell because the colors are pretty. So in result you're just an idiot spending money on colors for a gun. You are too special for the regular skins?----Competitive:          All you will expirence is rage towards your teammates because they don't do the thing you expect them to do. Or people will insult you with a mic because you're a noob even if it's round 1 and no shooing began. Or you can compare with your friend your rank saying hey I am in AK Gold I don't have any skills I just play a lot and insult people.----Game itself:         If you play none Competitive mod all you will find is either the casual mod which is good but filled with players who filled with rage because they are disapointed of their ranks on Competitive so you will end up leaving. The only good part of Counter Strike Globale Offensive is the mods like Jailbreak, deathrun, surf. But most people don't play on it because they play those awesome mods on CSS the real thing.----Opinion:Great game, but sadly money and popularity caught up. And now people don't play the game like they use to. It's all about competitive and weapon skins which is depressing. And now I saw they added a kill cam? I am sorry to say but this game died 1 year ago. If you're interested to play competitive and spend all you money on useless skins be my guest.Even if playing Competitive is all about raging towards your teammates or simple rage because you think your good but you're not. If you got taste in video game, then buy counter strike source. I am sorry but if this is a good game for you, you are not better than League of Legends players and not gamers.FYI there is no true challenge raising in ranks in CS:GO it's all about playing a lot no skills is needed.

The game has many maps to play (Active and Reserve pool) and they all look great by texture. Ofc, there will be maps you like and dislike but that's normal. CS:GO is a game that is compatible with any Operating System on ur computer/notebook, you can play this game on any system (notebook/macbook/imac/computer because it doesn't require great specs to be playable. The Character models and weapons texture can maybe be improved, especially the character models. More variouty would do a great work in my opinion, but some people of course do love the game as it is. The weapon skins and items variouty is amazing in this game, you have many options for every weapon. Everyone is able to find something to his/her personal taste which is a great thing. Also every now and then there is an operation, which gives you a nice badge, more maps to play (u will lose them after the operation ended) but meanwhile the operation u can play anytime on those maps which all look great. I want to thank a big part of the community for making amazing stuff in this game. Personally I would rate this game a 9/10 and it's my favorite by far. The only reason I don't rate it 10/10 is because many people are so toxic in this game, but to make them shush is just block communication. Many people want to win, and when they lose they become toxic, but sometimes you just can't win because there is always someone better then you!+ points : no lagg. good graphics. nice weapon skins. great maps, good workshops, customizeable in some ways to maximum ur performance.- points : many toxic players, so the only down point is some people of the community, especially Russians",Sun Sep 05 20:06:54 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

dd61f575-94be-4c15-b115-ed6d92699905,8,"I am one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'veterans', who started playing with counter strike 1.6 (didn't have my own account by those time, though) and I have long story of 'relationship' with counter strike universe and csgo universe especially. Telling in advance - I made long way from hating csgo up to loving it. But anyway, to the point:For people, who don't know what counter strike is, and who never heard about this game before:Counter strike is unique semi-reallistic game, which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups (somali pirates, phoenix connection, etc) and different law enforcement groups (SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, SWAT, FBI etc). Game features several rounds (from 16 up to 32, depends on a gamemode and server rules), where every player have only one life per round. As soon as round time ends, or one of the teams eliminated, round is finished. After every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets (armor, flash and smoke grenades, etc). Game features several game modes:(classic) hostage rescue (maps with ct_prefix):Counter Terrorists must steal hostage (or any of the several hostages) from a place, secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone. As soon as hostage is brought, or whole terrorist team eliminated, counter terrorists win. If time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area, terrorists win. As soon as counter terrorist carries hostage, whone CT team gets extra 1:30 minute time to reach safe place.(classic) bomb defuse (maps with de_prefix):Terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants. Problem is, there's only one bomb per whole team. As soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead, another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point. Counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place, if it's fallen. As soon as bomb is planted, round time stops and to win, counter terrorists must defuse bomb. If bomb is blown, even though all terrorists are dead, terrorist team wins the round.gungame (Honestly, forgive me if I make mistake here, but it's one of the gametypes I barely played): The least teamplay addicted game type. You start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone, you get new weapon. As soon as you come through all the weapons (including knife), you win the map. You instantly respawn after death. I remember there was also gungame gametype, where you had only one life, but gungame is not my cup of tea, so let's finish on this.deathmatch:Also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death. But, unlike gungame, you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life. You should kill as many enemies, as you can. Thanks to respawn in random places of the map, fight itself reminds a messy war, where enemy can shoot you in the back (just because he respawned there) and so on. I don't normally play this gametype aswell, but if I remember right, this gametype was brought by community.Also, community made more gametypes, like zombiemod, bunnyhop (or whatever is it called) and deathrun, where you need to reach some point.Now, for people who played cs for a while. Main differences from cs 1.6 and css here are: partially new weapons, updated radio commands, updated hostage rescue mode, where you need to actually PICK UP only ONE hostage and bring him to the safe place. Weapons have changed physics, so you'll need to learn everything again. And, an old problem, which became more important duo to competative gamemode: CHEATERS! Can't say there are many cheaters, but when you meet them, whole fun is ruined. Same when you meet stupid people.As we reviewed the game (I tried to be as short as possible), I'll express my mind on it:Firstly, I hated this game. It seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy. It had (and it still has) changed radio commands (yes, I was one of those few people, who used radio commands), you couldn't (and still can't) choose your player model (only team, like in css beta), you had and (still have) some grenades, which, probably don't even exist (decoy and incendinary, the molotov analogue, btw molotov here bounces from the wall, wtf?), or at least I was unable to find any info about them. In hostage rescue mode, why would you need to save only ONE hostage? Why would cops leave another one behind? You couldn't place silencer on M4 and 'base ct pistol', or use flashlight and many more things which I couldn't remeber right now. With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation:First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal...And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games.",Tue Aug 31 17:24:20 EEST 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

Continuous and spontaneous crashes and other issues (including your aim being locked and you are dropped to 20fps) ruin the competitive experience. The random crashes don't seem to be as common for PC users for whatever reason. Recent updates to the Matchmaking system have now caused lower-ranked players (Silver and Gold Nova) to be continually matched with players with considerably more skill and experience, known as ""Smurfs"" to the community. While these ranking tweaks had good intentions, especially for highly-ranked players (Global Elite, SMFC etc.), they just seemed to amplify the smurfing problem to  a much greater extent. Smurfing ruins the competitive scene, especially for beginners and lower ranked players who have not yet been able to grow and learn to the extent of the experienced 'Smurfs'. While some may acclaim that Smurfing allows players to improve, by playing against players of greater skill, when you lose a gun battle to a smurf, round after round, you're forced to sit and spectate while you wait for the next round to begin. If you are most interested in watching the game instead of being able to play it, watching Professional CSGO tournaments might be your speed. It makes it hard to improve at the game when you are pummeled by a Smurf game after game, day after day.Besides this all, the millions of daily players cannot be wrong. Gameplay is fluent and heavily based on cooperation with teammates. CSGO gives a motivation to improve, to climb the Matchmaking ranks and become the best player you can be. Even the weapon skins add  a huge element to the game that is purely about a virtual economy for aesthetic customisations in-game.CSGO is an immersive experience, and is a great game to play with friends - a game to learn together and grow together to top the ranks of Competitive Matchmaking. However, every game has its flaws. Crashes, gameplay issues and smurfing are amongst the most heinous (and I haven't even touched on the cheaters). Overall, 400 hours of regular playtime speaks for itself, but major issues need to be addressed so that the game becomes more enjoyable for everyone, becomes a more competitive experience and the community can grow together in appreciation of the game.",Wed May 05 08:07:27 EEST 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

But it would all be a contradiction in that case. Long story short, game developers no longer know what they're doing. First a battle royale mode, and now this...?What actually costs money is thePrime Edition, which pretty much gives you preference in terms of matchmaking. Which means you'll most likely face other players who bought the game more often.The main problem being that, as it is now a F2P game, hackers won't need to pay up to cheat. If they're banned, they can just make another account. Now, to the actual review.The game is good overall. Mostly based on you using your sight and your hearing to locate enemies. And also controlling your weapon's recoil.Although your weapon may seem normal in your screen, the bullet pattern will certainly not be normal, especially if you're used to spray and pray.Of course, there will be moments of tension where aiming a centimeter lower may get you a kill, or get you killed.Toxicity levels aren't high, but they're not low either. It's what you can expect from a game with a competitive scene nowadays. As you no longer need to pay to play it, installing it is up to you.One thing I'll mention though: just tap fire with the AK-47.

7c0c2859-ff30-45c1-8e6a-7ee9b6c9072d,1,"""2 days ago, December 7, 2018, a date which will live...in gamer infamy. the veteran CSGO community, was violently and deliberately attacked, by instincts and greed, of the Empire of Valve. The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response.It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers.The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves.Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community.As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us.""DISCLAIMER: I made this as a joke review because I thought it be creative as hell. This is also to commemorate for the fallen of the Pearl Harbor attack planned by the Empire of Japan, I give credit to FDR for creating the original and thought provoking speech for Congress and the people of the United States. However, I still give this a negative review because I don't agree with valve's instincts of making a BR gamemode to attract a community of children to play this game and the Free to Play option.

61bac3db-4405-472e-bd72-1d8b688bc0af,6,"The CS:GO community has grown since it was first released a few years ago, but that doesn't mean it has gotten better. The community has inevitably grown to something much more than it was originally intended to be. What do I mean by this? Well I'll point that out.1. The number of hackers/cheaters has only gotten bigger over the years and Valve isn't doing anything about it, unfortunately. Yes, the VAC system works, but there are some cheats out there that are undetectable, an example such as LMAO Box (which is also heavily in TF2). Valve doesn't care about their own community in terms of cheaters/hackers, but they can fix this, by improving the security of their ""reliable"" anti-cheat system. 2. The community is full of trolls and jerks. There will always be at least one or two trolls within a server trhat you currently play in. There always be someone screaming over the mic, cursing out other people, and overall being more or less of a big annoyance. There's nothing you can do about either, you can't mute the person within the game, you have to deal with it or you have to mute your sound or leave to go to another server, which defeats the whole purpose in getting a higher rank. You can also decide to have a poll to have the user kicked off, but this never works. They will always attempt to vote you off if you are caught voting the targeted user off. It's also really annoying when someone voted to reset the server match over 50 times because they died and everyone votes to reset the match. No one cares for other people's enjoyment, they only care about themselves. 3. The economy in this game is demanding. There will always be people asking for things, such as knives, weapon sking and stickers. The first time I heard trading was introduced in this game, I knew it was going to stir trouble. Like TF2, people trade for greed and wealth, not for playing the game for fun. Speaking of which, your always made fun of if you don't have a skin attached to a weapon, not everyone wants those things you know! CS:GO is turning into TF2, Overwatch and COD all at the same time. The community has only gotten worse over the years and Valve isn't doing anything to improve/fix this. I don't want to think of this as another TF2, but unfortunately, that is what it has become and it will likely always be that from now on, because Valve wants all their games to be similar in terms of their other multiplayer games.",Fri Nov 26 06:35:18 EET 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die.

It's late at night and the events of that day seem like they happened so long ago. Yet, I can't get them out of my head right now. Maybe it's just my nerves. Maybe it's the darkness outside. I don't really care, honestly, but I need to get this off my chest. Otherwise, I might not be able to sleep tonight. Damn these memories, I wish they would just go away.It was about eleven years ago when I was in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I was in the seventh grade and I was that kid who wore all black and listened to heavy metal in the back of the classroom. Yeah, I was a goth kid. It seems silly to think about now, but everyone had their own little click when they were in LAN parties, I suppose. The goth scene really appealed to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a kid. I was bullied a lot, even before I decided to wear all black and listen to heavy metal full blast on my walkman. The '♥♥♥♥ everyone else in the world' mantra really suited Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at the time. And, for three of my 'CSGO Buddies', it suited them as well. I guess that's why we got along so well.My CSGO Buddies, two of which I haven't heard from for several years now, were just like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They were goths too. Everyone back then had a clique, I suppose. They were mine. We would spend every waking moment together, both out and in of LAN parties. They were like my strange, outcast family. Well... at least they were. Times change. I still remember their faces clearly. There was Andy, a very tall, robust kid that was the oldest out of all of us. Kyle, my best CSGO Buddy, who was short and very thin. While his frame may have been small, he got into fights -a lot-. He had a fuse the size of a bacterium, and wasn't afraid to give someone he didn't like a black eye. Then there was Billy. Billy was bullied the hardest out of all of us. Braces, pimples, and thick-framed glasses made him the perfect target for bullying. Yet, we four didn't care about anyone else when we were hanging out together. The rest of the world didn't matter; only the next Slipknot album did.I'm rambling aren't I?Well, perhaps I should get to the meat of things then. Where this horrible memory comes from and why I never see those old CSGO Buddies anymore.My CSGO Buddies and I would always go to a park after LAN parties and on weekends to hangout. This park was massive and held a Counter-Strike diamond, a football field, and a soccer field for all of the little kids and their little league games. However, at the edge of this park, was a large wooded area. It was completely cut off from the rest of the park and community. That was where my CSGO Buddies and I would go to hang out. There, no one would see us or bother us. It was the perfect solitude for a couple of goth kids. The strangest thing about this little wooded area, however, was a large, out of place wall that seemed to edge to park. I found out later that the wall was meant to sepaCounter-Strike: Global Offensivee an old World War II factory from the park so that the kids wouldn't have to be reminded of the war, but to a couple of kids growing up in the early 2000's, it was an eerie landmark.The strangest part about the wall... aside from the terrible graffiti, was the seemingly out of place door right in the middle of the wall. The door was completely rusted over and had long lost its handle. The door was more or less part of the stone wall, at this point. I'm not really sure how it was able to stay standing after so many years of disrepair. It was definitely a testament to its forger.Now, I know that this must sound pretty cliché. Yet, I'm sure that whoever is reading this must be pretty curious as to what is behind that door. Well, as fate would have it, it turns out that four goth kids with nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon were also extremely curious as to what was behind that door.That Saturday afternoon, at about four p.m. or so... after the little league Counter-Strike game, I met up with my three bozo CSGO Buddies right by the door, since it was where we usually met. The three had obvious mischievous smiles plastered all over their faces.""Oh, what are you guys planning on doing?"" I asked accusingly, but a smile also stretching over my lips as I looked the three over. Andy grinned devilishly as he picked up a steel Karambit Knife from the tall grass. My eyes widened and my smile widened.""We're opening that door, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I stole this Karambit Knife from my old man's work truck. He's got, like, three of them. He won't even know it's gone."" Andy said laughing a bit. I remember becoming extremely giddy, almost attaining five year old levels of excitement.""Well? What the hell are you waiting for?! Open the door!"" I shouted at him. The other two began encouraging him as well. With a smug look, he placed the Karambit Knife at the frame of the door and began pushing on it. Now, Andy was a big kid and the door was extremely worn down. It didn't take much effort for him to open the door. With a loud crack, the door flung open, and the four of us, dumbstruck, looked into what was behind the door.It was a staircase going down into an incredibly dark basement... or bunker... or something. We couldn't even see the bottom of the stairs because of how dark it was. For about five minutes, we just stared down the concrete stairs in awe. Kyle was the first one to break the silence.""Whoa..."" he spoke, ""It goes down awhile, doesn't it?""""Yeah,"" Billy said, swallowing a bit. ""W-We should go though. Someone must have heard us. We gotta go before they call the cops.""""Oh, don't be such a baby. We've gone this far, we gotta go down the stairs!"" Andy exclaimed. The three of us looked at Andy with worried looks. We may have been goth kids, but we were still kids.""I don't know, Andy. It's pretty dark, and we don't have a flashlight."" Billy said.""Pfft, alright wuss. Go on, Kyle, you go down the stairs.""""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why the ♥♥♥♥ Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? You're the one who opened the door! You go down the stairs!"" He spat angrily. Andy furrowed his brow.""Yeah, and without my Karambit Knife, that door would still be closed, wouldn't it? I already get a free pass on this. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you got here last, you gotta go down the stairs!"" he yelled at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. My eyes widened as my attention turned from the stairs to the three others.""What? Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why? It wasn't even my idea to open the door! I'm not going down there!"" I said, worried.""Come on! Someone's gotta go down. Billy and Kyle are too big of cowards to do it. That leaves you.""""I'm NOT going down there.""""Oh? I can't make you?""""You can't force Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to do it.""""Oh really?""BAM!I felt the large, blunt force of a heavy hand against the back of my head as Andy sucker-punched Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Andy was bigger and, well, let's just say broader than all three of us put together. His punch nearly knocked Counter-Strike: Global Offensive out. In my daze, I remember hearing Kyle shout something as Andy placed his hands on my shoulder and shoved Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I didn't hit the ground like I thought I would. Instead, I just remember falling. Falling down and down into an unfathomable abyss of darkness. He pushed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive down the stairs, but being as light as I was, I never even hit a single concrete step. I just fell, and fell, and fell until I hit the bottom. I hit the concrete floor hard. The impact knocked the wind out of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but, surprisingly, I didn't break any bones or, well, die. The world span and I couldn't even get up, let alone speak.",Thu May 13 07:47:22 EEST 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

7c4e0482-08fd-4915-b837-71e97c453e37,7," I don't speak English really well, so try to understand what is implied.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer FPS games, where two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, battle for a specific mission. The game was initially a mod for Half-Life, Valve's first game, until the sequels of the game were created some time later.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest game of the series, and today it is the most-popular competitive FPS game ever played. The game is just basically the same as the first Counter-Strike games, but a ton of additions and improvements were done.  Graphics First, the graphics. This is probably the biggest improvement in the series, as the game now looks more pleasing to the eyes, it has smooth movements throughout the game, and there has been a lot of decal improvements. Compared to the earlier games, Global Offensive provides a better and player-friendly nature thanks of today's modern graphics.Of course all of these cannot be achieved if you don't have the requirements to play on a flawless gameplay, but it is believed that it can run even on entry-level PC's.  Gameplay Gameplay. As I have said before, Global Offensive is mostly the same as the earlier games, consisting of the two game modes Bomb Scenario, wherein Terrorists must plant a bomb to a bomb site in a map and the Counter-Terrorists must defend or defuse the bomb if planted, and Hostage Scenario, wherein Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages held by Terrorists.Though there are additionals game modes that can be played. These modes are the Arms Race, Demolition, and Deathmatch. (although I believe these modes can be played on the previous games through a mod)Global Offensive also made changes to the gun system, they have added more guns to the shop and made improvements to them.The sound is still the same as the previous ones, however, around this year they have made changes to the guns' sounds, But the sound from Global Offensive is a lot better and clear than the others. Community The community is what most Valve games' community have. There isn't really much to say here, although it's worth mentioning that the community on this game series is actually more friendly and cooperative than other Valve's games. And since this a competitive game, (I'd say highly competitive), a lot of players are pretty serious on playing since this involves a huge amount of cooperation with the team.Toxicity is somewhat not that visible to the game, so players who are really serious about competitive games are present. Miscellaneous Like DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2, Valve's other popular games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has also what they call the inventory system. Here you can get item drops such as gun skins, gun stickers, and cases where you can get the gun skins and stickers. These items can be used to customize your gun loadout, or sell them to the Steam Market, where you can get money from. (If you are lucky, there are rare items which have high price on the market listings where you can sell those rare items for $$$.) Final Notes Overall, this game is one of the best games out there, for a cheap price, and offers a lot of opportunities to choose how you want to play the game. You could try making yourself into the game and go for the rankings, play casually to pass time, or probably to troll just to relieve stress and have fun for yourself. There is a lot of space for you to improve in the game, but still, like most multiplayer game does, playing this game with friends give the best possible experience and gameplay for the game.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not a pay-to-win game, and if you wanted to spend money on this game, make sure you just make it worth the money you spend on the game.-----------Definitely get this game if you want to get started on competitive gaming, or if you're just looking for a game that is worth the time and money spending. In fact, the most annoying and irritating things that could occur in the game is actually the most hilarious and most fun to deal with.Counter-Strike is a really popular game, so why not just get the game, and shoot down other players and join the fun?",Sun Apr 18 11:26:56 EEST 2021,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

My opinion, however, is that this game's competitive ranking system is total garbage. Now before you go on raging in the replies saying ""ERMAGURD GO BACK TO COD MAD CUZ BAD GET GUD LUL"" please read the following.This system is poorly designed because you constantly have to be paired with good teams in order to win games and thus rank up in your competitive rank. For the uneducated, the more games you win, the more likeley you are to rank up, but if you lose games, you lose your rank. When you are constantly being paired with people who don't have microphones or toxic squeakers who don't know what they're doing, you derank all the way to silver one. The non comeptitive rank literally means nothing and is just there to look nice, which in my opinion should determine which skill group you're in for competitve, but nope. The system Valve built requires you to get lucky and be paired with a decent team that can communicate easily and knows what they're doing, which won't happen unless the planets align during a full moon.So if you don't want to constantly grind competitive matches and face a toxic community filled with tryhards and squeakers, don't download this game.",Thu May 13 02:20:55 EEST 2021,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6

Ok, but seriously, this game is good. It's considered one of the best superhero games ever made for a reason, and it definitely deserves its reputation. I do have some issues with it, though. Combat feels mashy, and it never really grows out of that despite adding different enemy types as the game goes on. You really just mash your way through the basic enemies and then press TWO buttons instead of ONE to get rid of the special enemies. Game design! But the combat is fun, if basic, so it gets a pass. The most interesting gameplay definitely comes from the stealth sections. You can get super creative in how you handle them, and they're by far the most fun part of the game. The story is pretty good. Kevin Conroy does an amazing job as Batman, and of course, Mark Hamill as Joker is incredible. Those two actors make this game that much more immersive with how well they portray Batman and Joker. The world is incredibly detailed, with tons of references and easter eggs scattered throughout the map that really flesh out Arkham City in the Batman universe. Speaking of the Batman universe, Batman's Rogues Gallery is on full force. So many cool villains are here. Two Face, Joker, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, even lesser known characters like Victor Zsasz and Calendar Man.

CS:GO as any of the CS games has, one of the most addictive and challenging gameplay ever. Technically the game is perfect: good graphics, fast respond updates to bugs and problems. One of the best anti-cheat systems in the world. Yep, better than Blizzard's. (You may not agree with the sentence about the anti-cheats, but I will explain this down.) And, even the market for ""goods"" and DLCs is perfect. It's focused on the older and more experienced players. Lots of ""skins"" for the new players and new ""operations""(maps) for the older players. The more you play, the better this game becomes. Like I said, technically perfect on any aspect. The problem comes form the game community. You may agree with, that the most of the players in this game are 12 years old kids with urgent desire to sleep with your mother. And, after few hours with the game you will become a polyglot linguist, mostly in slavic phiology (Polish, Russian). But this aren't the main problem. The problem is in the COMPLETE tolerance, the COMPLETE ignorance and the COMPLETE lack of knowledge from the community, about the CHEATERS. This game possess one of the most complete anti-cheat systems. It covers every aspect of the game: VAC- automatic anti-cheat program, Overwatch system for precise observation. This two programs are in constant communication with the main game and the ""Matchmaking system""- so, all of the cheaters to end playing against each other and to get banned. But, ...BUT... This system relys on, the ""willingness"" of this community to use this system, to deal with the cheaters. Unfortunately, by this complete negligence the system is doing more damage to the people who are willing to help by using it. Rather than to the cheaters.If you are ""new"" to the game. My advice is to skip this game and don't start it.",Sun Apr 25 08:57:43 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

Within 4 hours i reached Rank 3 Battleships, and level 7.I downloaded the game expecting it to be like most other Vehicle Combat games on the market right now, with health bars and just shoot where ur cursor is, and to an extent that's the case here. Now you could say War Thunder has spoiled me with it's Interiors and modular system, but to an tiny degree WoWs has it too with guns being knocked out and fires spreading. But it's not quite up to WT standerds of having each crew being able to be knocked out and shooting at direct points of armour to hit a small ammo rack or feul tank. Now it does Have Armour but not X-ray. Well It keeps me happy that the HP bars aren't too overused.But let's get real here, nowadays EVERYONE talks about Graphics or FPS. For me, BOTH were above average. I got arround 30-40 fps on the highest settings and it looked great ! But still not a solid 60 or 200 ... War Thunder has this issue too, so i will let this one slide.Although the game does hold your hand annoyingly in the first levels. When i started the game, i was fustrated because i couldn't even access the Tech Tree until i was level 2. I spent atleast 20 minutes looking in the game settings and their video tutorials for where the button to it might be hidden. And when i DID get the tech tree open, it's shallow AS ♥♥♥♥. There is like only 10 ships of 1 type per type FOR 3 TYPES or if your lucky and picked America or Japan you get Aircraft carries ......... Even though britain ruled the waves, they still don't have a flushed out tech tree.Now even though the i am from England, and the British Empire did have the largest navy in the tree i could atleast get the famout Hood right ? The biggest ship in the Navy ? Well the Japanese get the Yamato and the Yanks get the Iowa, BUT NO the Hood was made a premium ...

Also there is no mod which is very good where some mods would give players some advantage over other players which could make the game unfair like in WoT.Unfortunattely, you can't use your existing account and not even choose the same name as you have in the client version.Another things that is very dissapointing is as soon as you get to tier 2 ships, Now the realâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥happens like in World of Tanks....The MatchMaking...Yeah you are tier 2 and you play against tier 3...Thats the beginning...When you get to tier 6 you may probably play against tier 8 which willâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥you off like WoT does to you. When you are tier 8 you know sameâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥again.PS. Maybe I can be wrong for some statement but that's whatt I've experienced In WoT.. I hope its not the same in WoWSo, I would recommend to play low tier for a more enjoyable gameplay.",Sun Jul 05 16:30:36 EEST 2020,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game is actually great, and has a skill curve to its mechanics like maneuvering in such slow ships but also in aiming precisely. On first launch, my machine ran the game quite choppily, but that was all resolved after altering the settings quite a bit. Nonetheless, I enjoy the variety of ships, and at the moment I'm using the British line. yet every nation's line is relatively balanced. In addition, the game encourages making quick decisions and punishes bad ones. To conclude, I really like this game!

Unfortunately all things have good and bad sides:Pros:- Amazing graphics for a supposedly ""arcade"" game(Seriously though, they are good even if it was a simulator)- Good audio- Huge playerbase(you usually get into a battle within 1:30 minutes)- Divisions and clans(Good to play with friends)- Huge variety of ships(200+ ships from 8+ nations. Also there are four(4) ship types: Aircraft carrier, Battleship, Cruiser   and Destroyer.)- It has its own fun and adrenalin filled moments.- Lots of third party mods for people who like that kind of stuff.- Very well optimised(It can run quite well on even a old computer)So far so good. But we still have the cons:- LOOOONG grind to tier X(like maybe 3-5 months per LINE of ships)- Matchmaking is a bit of a problem: Sometimes you don't even want to sail in a tier V ship unless you absolutely have to.   Trust me when you're fighting a tier VII ship in a tier V it's hard.- Some people can be salty: Some people might get upset when they get destroyed or if matchmaking does not favour   them. Even i'm salty sometimes when i get one-shotted by someone.- Premium ships: These are ships you have to pay to get. They are usually stronger than the normal mainline variant of the   ship. These are expensive(around 3500 inr for a tier VIII premium battleship).- Premium account: Like premium ships, there is a premium account status that you can pay to get. This gives you   increased credit and XP income. It's a little bit more fairly priced but it's still expensive.Overall, its a great game. Definitely a game i would recommend.

994d3b01-2d87-4494-a908-ac021c95ffc4,4,I played this game before it was on steam and when it was first released and I loved even spent probly 50-100 hours on it and spent some money on it. After awhile I stopped playing it for no reason other than I just moved on to something else it but now I saw it was on steam and decided to try it out again. Well lets put it this way its a completely different game than it was before and I feel personally its not better its worse. The UI is competely trash on the main screen. The keybinds are not the same as before and the keybinds are horrible I couldnt play with how they are on default and yes I know you can change them but still the controls are confusing and just plain out bad. The match making isnt great at all as its awsome to get placed with tier 4 ships at tier 1 which is kinda of ruins the whole pvp system. The only thing I liked was the PVE that now if it doesnt fill up with players under 30 seconds it places bots which is nice.This isnt a bad game it was just a better game before they reworked everything and changed things around again my option is some of those changes werent great. Basically if you never played this game before you might like it and you wont notice or care about some of the big issuses I have with it now but to anyone who has played this game when it was in beta might not like the things they did.,Sat Mar 28 00:51:10 EET 2020,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

I have tier 10, few premium ships etc but I cannot give it a positive review as every game is identical. Torps are spammed from ships ranging from destroyers to battleships. Battleships sit back lobbing shells at max range for this reason which again gets boring quickly. If like me your an aggressive player, this isnt rewarded on this game as your secondary batteries are rendered completely obsolete by torpedos. A typical game is, Destroyers charge up, then pop smoke and sit in this spamming torps. Once smoke clears, they pull back, recharge then repeat. Battleships sit as far back lobbing shells. Aircraft carriers are near impossible to make money with so hardly encountered. All in all, for a free game its worth a play I would wouldnt invest any cash into it or concern yourself with getting to tier 10 as its exactly the same as previous tiers, just more torp able ships.

I also think that you should change the name of your game to call of duty world at war or something similar. I also think that this would be an amazing game if you would take out anything related to war and death and destruction and put it something to do with internet cat memes. that would be a major improvement and you should name it call of duty kitten cuddleing simulator.,Wed Jun 16 02:44:51 EEST 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

As for team (clan) battles - you can't sit in one clan with friends, but play in different team as a recruit.

World of Warships is a fun arcade style schooting game featuring World War II ships with 4 ship types to choose from the fast and deadly sometimes stealthy Destroyers to the firebugging cruisers (Royal Navy Light Cruisers are an exception) to the big bullies or the Battleships on the battlefield and finally the deadly raptors of the skies the aircraft carriers.Although I do enjoy playing this game I do have some issues regarding this game Matchmaking From tier 5 onwards the matchmaker will match you +2 tier oppoments from the current selected tier of your ship instead of just 1 tierThis especially becomes a problem at tier 8 as most often you will get matched with tier 10 opponents Playing on Weekends I generally avoid playing this game on weekends as most of your teamates will evolve from potatoes to french fries with lots of salt meaning you'll probably lose more games than you would on a weekday (I think this only applies to the ASIA server the server which I reside. I currently don't know bout the other servers on weekends) TLDR; Save yourself from stress and play another game during weekends unless you want to suffer.  Aircraft Carrier Saipan I don't see this as an issue though more like a heads up But Saipan is the queen of the skies at Tier 7 and the bane of aircraft carrier player when facing against most often the Saipan will win due to the captain having the air supriority skill or just a seasoned CV player is general.

I know its balanced out within the team but for the players that come into a game with a lower tier ship against a superior ship is not my kind of fun. Tier 8 does not exist anymore because your guarenteed to be put in a Tier 10 Battle. My other gripe is that when you work your way up to a desired ship that your after that has just been released, weeks later they will nerf it so all that hard work into thinking your getting the ship that was reviewed is removed, they should fully test the ship before reviewing it. Numerous occations i have worked hard to get these ships then in comes the nerf which makes the ship totally crap.Other than these gripes the game is awesome, i have played since the beta and have progressed through most of the ships.

Outfit your fleet with flags, camouflage, modifications, talented commanders, and more!World of Warships is one of the World of X titles in Wargaming portfolio, next to World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. It's a clash of 16-24 ships in PvE bot battles, scenario missions or PvP combat. You take control of a ship - quick and agile destroyer, slow and tanky battleship, somewhere-in-between cruiser or a plane carrier - and destroy other ships while trying to control strategic points on the map.WoWs looks very pretty and if you're interested in navy battles just play it. It's free after all. If you don't know if you're interested... It's a rather slow and strategic, mostly PvP, naval fight game. It's extremely fun even if you don't like PvP games and it can really suck you in. It's a squad based game, so your enjoyment greatly depends of the quality of your team. If your team is bad you will lose. Most often than not it's not possible to carry and, as there are no respawns, the margin for error is slim, even if you're amazing but have a bad team you will fail. And failing is not fun. I have to say I have a love hate relationship with this game as I love the idea, looks, music and pretty much everything, but bad teams make me hate it very much. For that hate moments there are bot battles though, these are easier and more fun even if less rewarding.As to the f2p aspect. The game can be enjoyed free for a long time. Having said that mind that in higher tiers - there are 10 - you can lose in-game money, needed for resupply, when playing normally. You can gain money playing lower tiers though, so it's not like you have to pay to play. If you want to pay the game can be extremely expensive with ships costing up to 50 euro per one (that's normal for these kind of games unfortunately, WarThunder is the same). Real world money gives you some more in-game money (needed for resupply and parts), xp (for captain skills) or cosmetics, but doesn't give you any additional power (like special ammo). Also while you can buy premium ships for money without any grinding you will not be proficient enough to succesfully play them. And most of them are great for collectors but so so for competitive play.One more thing, you have to invest time into the game. To not suck much in PvP you'll need ca. (20hrs * tier) of playtime, more or less, so for tier V you'll need about 100hrs of playtime to be proficient enough not to be a burden. Your milegae may vary.I liked:* looks, everything looks sooo pwetty* music* bot matches are fun and relaxing* PvP matches are fun and keep you on edgeI disliked:* it's multiplayer so expect lots of salt* if your team is bad you might not have any fun at all (most teams are bad)Get this if:* you're interested in navy battles and history, lots of classic ships like Perth, Yamato, Bismarck, Warspite, etc.* you like PvP games that don't require twitch reflexes* you like to watch pretty boats in a large pond (if you're less competitive just play low tier bot matches and enjoy)Don't get this if:* you cannot stand the salt in PvP* you cannot stand the grind (~100hrs are needed to get not bad, way more to get good; ~300hrs to get to tier 10 ships without buying premiums)",Tue Dec 22 23:29:15 EET 2020,7538609a-a5e1-47e9-9b84-f27b650d683c

09fdc759-be87-4b7c-9549-5bfc2b066a6a,6,"I really enjoyed the singleplayer of this game. You can't even compare that to Call of Duty: Black Ops singleplayer experience because it's like 10 levels above that. It has amazing graphics and physics (In Black Ops the only thing you could do that involves physics is shoot a bottle from the table. You can't even compare that to this amazing game). You have so many different ways to fight your enemy (or even sneak past them all together in stealth mode) and the AI is very smart aswell. The Multiplayer is way better than the one of Black Ops in my opinion since it simply has the nanosuit. You have to take care of multiple things at once. Your nanosuit's energy, the people you are facing and the objective you have to execute. My favourite gamemode would be ""Assault"" it's basicly like Call of Duty's Search and Destroy (round based) but with hacking terminals. It's a gamemode that requires a lot of teamwork.",Fri Apr 09 14:32:32 EEST 2021,60270481-4b7f-49cc-9b1d-113edfd3ccc3
09fdc759-be87-4b7c-9549-5bfc2b066a6a,1,"Quite a mixed bag, unfortuantely, with little to no mechanism for keeping player's engaged.The first ten-fifteen hours whilst you're learning the mechanics and unlocking the different ship classes are genuinely fun. It's visually engaging, the ships handle well, particularly the fast cruisers they start you off with and timing your shots requires real skill. Finding a game is easy and level up fast and unlock quite a few ship classes rapidly, giving you a firm handle of the mechanics pretty fast: Battleships are slow and heavy hitting, Destroyers are fast and fire torpedoes, Cruisers mix speed with heavy cannons and Carriers play like a simple RTS, with you directing planes to attack enemy ships from the map.However, that's all it ever is. When you get Carriers at around level 4 you have experienced all the gameplay mechanics you ever will, which is unforunately the point at which you are expected to seriously grind to unlock the remaining 6 levels of ships. Each ship class has at most one or two abilities, none of which makes for a really compelling mechanic in themselves, and these don't really change as you level up. There's none of the diverging options you get from a MOBA, nor are the base classes particularly engaging either. Sure, the higher levels become more powerful or handle differently, but every battleship will be slow and hit hard, regardless of level 10 or level 4. There are zero differences in their skills. Unless of course you buy the upgrades or earn them through lootboxes.I honestly don't have a problem with the Pay2Win elements. Do I think the upcoming Stalingrad battleship and its unashamed overpoweredness stinks? Sure. But they aren't egregious at the low levels, and only become a problem at higher levels, which you will need a lot of patience to reach. There are obligatory loot boxes, but the stuff they provide again felt incredibly pointless, particularly when if your ship sinks it loses most of the upgrades on it. Honestly, considering that the flags and camo patterns add colour to an overwhelmingly grey game, it is a bit of shame that they are lost when your ship sinks. It would be much more interesting if they were permenant, purely visual, upgrades. In a game where only a few ships survive most games, it does make these upgrades feel trivial.There are a few remaining gripes I have.  The game REQURIES teamwork to be fun, but the devs have failed to create the tools which would engage the audience sufficiently in this. Being able to see the paths of your allies would be great. Being able to see what upgrade they are packing would make teamwork much easier. There is so much MISSING from this game's mechanics, which is baffling, as the devs have spent a lot of time and effort on the many ship classes. The carrier gameplay is dull. Incredibly dull. If you lose your fighters because your team didnt coordinate AA fire on the enemy fighters, then you are completely hobbled for the rest of the game as your bombers are picked off by the enemy. If you manage to succeed at gaining air superiority then be prepared for pointing bombers at targets on the map view for the whole game. To give you an idea: take Supreme Commander. Lock yourself to the most zoomed out view. Give yourself only 3 units. See how long it takes you to get bored. You essentially have WoW's Carrier game. There are a decent array of maps and gametypes, but they all play the same. There are objectives, but realistically they all boil down to deathmatch as the lack of a respawn means that if you knock out a battleship you're in a better position then capping the objective. So everyone just steams for an objective or two, the destroyers get knocked out first, then the battleships and cruisers arrive and slug it out. Every. Time.TLDR:A great base mechanic which invovles predicting the pace of enemies and positioning your ship which is unfortunately let down by a complete lack of creativity or style when it comes to the other mechanics.

This is an awful company you should think twice about throwing money at. WoT is notoriously infamous for it's inbalances and P2W policies. Gladly WoWS is not nearly as broken as WoT, but since we're talking about WG it's only a matter of time if you ask me. 2. Playerbase. It's not the toxicity, it's the unbelieveable incompetence that breaks the game, especially on weekends when all our beloved weekend warrios login. ""Blame the players, not the game"" is especially true in this game. Yes, the game is flawed, but ultimately what breaks the game is the people playing it. The second issue could easily be resolved by either implementing skill based MM or making ranked play more available (It's limited to short periods of time and specific tiers only).Unfortunately WG relies on those masses of extremely bad players, who godknowswhy oppose skill based MM, as source of income since the game is F2P, so nothing will change.

7c190e02-83e1-47d2-93ba-f16edac698c3,2,"This review is from someone who is playing the japanese tech tree.Like the game, but the way you can go from a cruiser like the tenryuu and do completely fine match to match gaining 1000-2000xp per match to a battleship like the kawachi (which is concidered to be on the same teir) and be the least powerful ship in the battle, only gaining 400-600xp a match is rage inducing, it wouldn't be bad if you could skip the Kawachi and miyogi battleships by playing with the tenryuu but you can't. In order to unlock the other battleships you need to play as the kawachi first, this means you're the most disadvantaged player on the battlefield, most destroyers can literally beat you just by sniping you from miles away giving you no chance of ever hitting them. So you're literally forced to kamikaze as a battleship(Second biggest ships to aircraft carriers btw) hoping you do some damage or get a kill, then play on your phone until the battle finishes and finally you can repeat the process until maybe after an afternoon and ngiht you have a slightly better ship (The miyogi IV) which is still awful. You might say ""Well they offer premium ships"" and you'd be correct, I saw this option and decided to buy a tier IV class battleship(that severely outclasses any regular teir IV battleship i might add) for $6 to get myself on the ground and skip the awful grind of the kawachi, for about 6-7 hours i played as my new ship and had some of the most fun a warship game has ever given me, smooth controls, fast ship, accurate and long range weapons only to realize after gaining around 11,000xp that none of that can be spent on the tech tree unless you convert the XP with the in game purchased currency. Which is absurd seeing how i paid for the ship, now i have to pay to use the experience i gained with the ship? How is that fair, that solidates the fact i will never buy anything else on this game because the standard it sets is just purchasing your way through the teirs whenver you start losing too much. And i get why they make the frist few battleships difficult to grind through, because they know if it was as easy as just playing a tenryuu everyone would just play as the battleships. but still they're making their point way too hard. and the fact that i feel like Forrest Gumps shrimping boat could body me definitely rubs me the wrong way.

839224e5-7950-4e73-9799-371b6fdafcd9,0,"I cannot advise against playing this game enough. This is not a good game, and the publisher/developer behind it is not worth supporting. This game sells a power fantasy to the highest bidder and keeps people engaged through the same triggers as a slot-machine.In short: The game itself suffers from horrendous balance issues and blatant pay-to-win problems. The developers have consistently been deceiving, insulting, and even threatening the playerbase. The game is player-vs-player focused. It features ships from various points in time. There is a progression system for advancing up tiers in a tech-tree. There are numerous different tech trees for different nations. You earn credits and XP from battles - winning, killing ships, dealing damage, capturing objectives, and spotting enemies all award you varying amounts of credits and XP. In a battle, you can have ships of various nations and various types distributed amongst 2 teams. Furthermore, you can have ships of varying tiers. Up to tier 4, you will always either be in a highest tier ship or only ships one tier above yours in the battle. Starting at Tier 5, ships can be up to 2 tiers higher than yours. The higher tier the ships, the more powerful they are. So the game is inherently designed around you wanting to get to higher tier ships, so you can more easily beat your opponents. If you are in a Tier 10 cruiser facing off against a Tier 8 cruiser, you will probably win - same if you are in a Tier 10 Destroyer, Battleship, or Aircraft Carrier. You can either try to make the most of your ship and let yourself be pummled over and over again by higher tier ships (with the occasional game where you are the one beating the lower-tier enemies), or you can pay money to skip past lower tier ships rather quickly and directly upgrade to higher tier ships. The higher your tier ship, the better the odds of you being in a top-tier match. However, ship progression is far from the only progression present in the game. In fact, it's probably one of the least important progression systems present in the game. What probably amounts to the most important progression system is the captain system. On any ship, you can slot a captain. This captain gains XP along with your ship - and once you accrue enough XP, you unllock a skill point for him to spend. These captain skills are incredibly powerful - making your ship that has a seasoned veteran just straight up better than the equal tiered opponents you face that do not have a captain of their own to match yours. If you wish to advance to a ship and take your captain along, your captain suffers what is called ""retraining"". During this time, you need to play with the captain on your ship to grind out XP to ""familiarize"" him with the new ship. The problem? The more you invested into your captain before, the longer retraining takes on a new ship. Except you can spend money to by-pass this problem entirely. Keep in mind that these captain skills are not trivial. There are entire ship classes (like destroyers or light cruisers) for whom these captain skills are essential to deal damage and survive. Without the correct captain skills, they are simply anemic XP and credit Pinatas for the enemy team. Additionally, Wargaming (the developer/publisher) has  the habit of continously powercreeping content with new ships released. That means that unless you invest an unfeasible amount of time into this game or fork over vast quantities of money, the line you are grinding will easily be obsolete in a few months, displaced by something that is just straight up better. They will milk the paying players for money and let them have overpowered ships for a few months. They eventually nerf these ships once the people who are likely to spend money to get them have done so, and then announce a new line a month or two later that will repeat the cycle. Additionally, this game features premium consumables and premium ships. Premium consumables are buy-for-each-battle items, that are direct upgraded versions over regular consumables. You can either pay exorbitant, non-sustainable amounts of in-game credits for, or you can pay real money for premium account time, premium camoflagues, buy in-game currency, or premium currency, all of which enable you to continously use these consumables. Premium ships are ships that you can only attain by paying money for them. They are virtually never changed from their initial state. They are typically released along with new ship lines. This means that while newly released regular ships are just as good as the premium counterparts, the premium ships will remain overpowered, while the regular ships are subject to balance changes. Just think about that; if you pay real money for a ship, it will never be nerfed. In a PvP game. When players point out the disparity between regular ships and premium ships, the developers will do any combination of the following things:    Remove the ship from sale, but not the game - usually with a ""buy now before you can't"" announcement  Degrade the players for ""just being bad"" and ""not being good"" (a blatant lie - the premium ships are just superior in stats)  Censor threads and videos calling them out, and even threaten legal action. None of this even addresses the combat in this game, which is absolutely attrocious. All guns you shoot in this game have dispersion. Absolutely staggering amounts of dispersion. We are talking ""divine intervention"" levels of dispersion here. (https://youtu.be/0Ae6B7C05Nk?t=1m6s) You can be randomly one-shot from a single shell striking your ship. Fires and flooding (damage over time effects) are based off of chance. And you can pay real money to skew the chances in your favor. ""Oh boy, will the salvo I just fired instantly obliterate that ship over there?"" The sound effects in the game itself mirror those you might hear on slot machines. Big explosions, sounds effects, and all. This game is fundamentally manipulative, deceiving, and exists to give a power fantasty to those willing to pony up the cash. I would go so far as to label it and its makers as evil. Please, do not play this.",Mon Nov 08 12:18:28 EET 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

401e337b-632f-4242-b637-7b6158f9083b,8,"TL;DR: ""Realistic"" long primary ranges hurt class balance and result in slow and passive gameplay, and no one seems to care.The bulk of my time in-game was spent on the standalone verison, not the steam version. Only downloaded the steam verison for convenience.The game is very visually impressive, i don't think i've seen anything more beautiful in a vido game than firing a full broadside in a battleship, or having your machine guns light up enemy aircraft.The issue i have is the gameplay. PvP is extremely passive, slow and unfun, for me at least. Wargaming seems to have an inconsistant method of applying ""realism"" to the game. They make the ranges for primary guns realistic (but not the sceondaries, for example) to the detriment of gameplay.WoWs is devided into 4 classes. A generalist class, being the Cruiser, a Support Class, being the Aircraft Carriers, and 2 Specialist Classes, being the Destroyers and Battleships, holding the roles of Harassers/Pickers and Tanks respectivly.Battleships, the ""tank"" class, has the highest Armor and Health, and the most powerful Primary Guns, as well as a large compliment of secondary guns for use at close range. A big issue here is that Batlleships primaries are also the longest ranged weapons in the game, which is realistic, but feeds into a few major issues. A High-Health class with that has a long-ranged attack is, by nature of the long range weapons, encouraged to hang back at maxium range to pick people off with the high burst-damage attacks, rather than push in and brawl with opponents at close range, as the secondary armament, as well as the supposed teamplay and counterbalance between Battlehsips and other classes such as the more versitile curiser would entail. From this you might conclude that battleships are Overpowered, but, removing thier range advantage, they're really not. With thier pluses comes their minuses. Battleships have the tankiest armor and health, but also have poor speed and trash manuverabaility. Thier Primaries are powerful sources of damage, but require a long time to reload inbetween shots, generally around 30 seconds per shot, and turn extremely slowly. Secondaries provide useful support damage at close range, but can *only* fire at close range, and are very innacurate, especially against small a nimble destroyers.All these weaknesses would be very exploitable in close-range battles, but because the Battleship's long range can allow it to sit well outside close range battles, rendeirng all these weaknesses irrelavant. Slow reload time and turret turn speed would hurt a brawling Battleship's ability to respond to new targets attacking at different directions, but because the Battleship is at long range, there's only ever one direction it needs to face. New targets are always a quick couple of degrees of turn away. Anything past that, and you're out of position, and will get focused or ambushed to death. Poor secondary range and accuracy is only a factor to consider if secondaries are given the oppuritunity to fire, which a Battleship at long range never provide. That minor extra damage isn't considered worth pushing forward to get focused by enemy long-range fireCruisers are the generalist class, supposedly good at everything, but not *great* at anything. It's medium damage, but fast-reloading primaries ideally would make great support fire for allied ships in brawls, being particularly decent at attacking destroyers, and chiping away at Battleships with fire damage form explosive shells, as well as providing specialized anti-air support against enemy fighters. The long range of battles hurts Cruisers, however.Cruisers have less range than thier Battleships counterparts, and so generally play second fiddle to them if they are present, relying on numbers advantages to attack enemy Battleships, since they cannot take advantage of map terrain due to the longer range, and so sit at a ""meh"" grade of power in the game.Destroyers, the Picker and Harasser class, are represented as the rock-paper-scissors counter to Battleships, which they are... at close range. Thier torpedos deal heavy, heavy damage depsite being slow-moving, which battleships (and some larger cruisers) at close range are generally unable to avoid very easily. But because, like we've well established by now, Battleships, and now Cruisers have no reason to come into close range, Destroyers are relegated to a vulture role of patiently wiating behind map terrain waiting for someone to overextend so they can be ambushed, since closing the distance regularly is a harder task. Destroyers have the highest manuverability and speed of any ship class in the game, as well as the smallest and thus hardest-to-hit profile, which gives them an advantage at avoiding slow-moving enemy shells at a distance, as well as the ability to deploy a smokescreen to provide artificial cover for themselves and teammates, but all of trivial effect if they are not within fighting range to begin with. All it takes is one lucky Battleship volley to take down a lightly-armored destroyer, and if an enemy destroyer at range is always inside an enemy Battleship's line-of-sight, a hit will happen at some point.Aircraft carriers, the indirect fire support class, are affected by the range issue in both ways. By nature of controlling planes in an rts-like fahsion, Carriers have the freedom to sit at extreme ranges, letting thier planes quickly fly to thier targets over the heads of allied ships, exceeding the range of even battleships by technicality. Carriers however, have no primary guns with which to defend themselves, armed with only secondary guns, if any at all, making them very vunerable to focus fire when in-range of an enemy, and so, like battleships, are encouraged to sit at maximum range, generally behind an island, or at the edge of the map. This is an issue in a couple ways. Firstly, it causes aircaft support to have long periods of downtime, as planes must travel long distances to and from thier target, reducing thier ability to play the game, and relegating aircraft to an ocasional danger to outliers in the group, rather than a near-constant threat that affects player positioning and movement, even if Aircraft are a powerful weapon. The second issue is that, again, carriers have poor abilities to defend themselves, and so, unless guarded by an escort willing to take themselves out of the battle, are essentially screwed if any enemy ship - generally destroyers - finds them at thier end of the map; Carriers are unable to recieve the passive support of thier teammates due to the danger of ranged focus fire, and so in turn are less able to support thier teammates.For these reasons, I personally find PvP to be very stale, passive and unfun. Matches very often pass the 20 minute limit due to how slow games are. I personally find Co-Op and PvE gamemodes to be more enjoyable, for the simple reason that Bots aren't afriad to be agressive. In PvE gamemodes, a double-broadside of secondary fire is not uncommon, and gameplay is more dymaic by way of taking advantage of the map layout. But due to how dumb/easy bots are, and due to the reduces rewards you get from PvE modes means your progrssion is going to be painfully slow unless you play a lot of PvP, which, for the pace it has, does not really interest me.And, attempting to discuss the issues (that i find are issues at least) in the community has, in my experience, generally been met with indifference or been provided with non-answers such as ""get good"", and the developers don't seem to be in a position to change thier game on these issues, probably due to popularity issues in the echo-chamber compettitive/higher tier players.Play it if you like playing slow, passive games i suppose.",Wed Apr 22 07:30:06 EEST 2020,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

But then I played it.  My god.  It's amazing.

-An actual good and original story.  Linear styled dialogue choices for most NPCs, but adds more unique choices (good, bad, etc) to certain dialogues.
-Absolutely beautiful.  Graphics, scenery, art style are all stunning.
-A protagonist you can really connect with and create meaningful emotion.
-Has a grind that never gets boring.  With beautiful scenery, many different creative mobs and many different ways to handle them.  Some easier, some harder, some very hard.  You become incredibly immersed in the gameplay and striking scenery.
-A working on-the-go crafting system that isn't complicated.
-Satisfying rewards. 
-Upgrading gear and weapons is very satisfying.
-Well rounded spec system - nothing seems useless and makes deciding your build less stressful; you're not punished for not choosing a specific path.  They're all useful in their own ways.
-Combat system is in-depth but smooth as butter once you learn each weapon type; once you learn them, you feel like a pro.
-I have experienced no bugs in this game

Wargaming.net constantly designs their games in a way which looks nice, but forces the customers to do annoying things as if they were complicated and needed detailed explanations. War Thunder is better designed, treats the gamer with more respect and plays better. When their ship portion is fully operation it will be a far better game than World of Warships.So Wargaming.net customer service would like to blame Steam for the inability of World of Warships to let me log on to my actual existing account. Apparently Steam does not allow you to log into accounts, although my World of Tank Blitz does, as does Eve Online, FF XIV, etc. They say the fix is simple, a seperate launcher they have, which is pretty unpopular in the community, the launcher gives an option to launch the game from a existing shortcut, but refuses to do so with the one in the Steam folder.

Simply an amazing game. The storyline is intriguing enough to make you want to follow it, and the world itself is full enough that aimlessly wandering through it is fun and often satisfying in its own rite. The variety of weapons allows you to cater much of the game to your play style, whether you prefer to sneak and snipe, run in with guns (or, I guess, arrows) blazing, or use traps to ambush your enemies (although you'll probably do all that and more).

The variety of enemies is pretty great. There are several human bandit types that you'll need to kill, but for the most part you'll be fighting various machines, mostly designed with inspiration from the animal kingdom. Each 'species' behaves in its own way, which can lead the way to some really creative combat styles, making the journey both challenging and fun.

Otherwise, the game on a whole is beautifully designed. The landscapes, people, and machines are all fantastically rendered. It's not a difficult thing to get lost wandering the land, whether you're en route to a mission, scouring for resources, or hunting down machines ...or rabbits. The variety of landscapes is pretty unrealistic, as your character can walk from a jungle area to a forest and then an icy tundra in a matter of minutes, but that variety keeps the settings from growing repetitive, and at least for myself, helps to give a sense of where in this world I'm wandering without needing to keep going back and forth to the map.

The story is pretty good (so far), and provides a pretty good set up to explain why humans are living in this sort of primitive world surrounded by deadly technology.",Sat Mar 27 23:34:09 EET 2021,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

Actually, in the beginning you get better ships faster than your skill improves.Sure, later on XP and credit accumulation is slow, but again this game is enjoyable at all levels, so unless you the 'endgame' guy, just kick back and go with the slow flow.I did spend around $10 to support the devs, and it is useful for getting ship slots so that I don't need to sell low-tier ships (as I progress) I'm still enjoying.Talking about slow flow, this is a great PVP shooter with a relaxed pace, especially with larger ships. Tactics, situational awereness and careful aim are key, not reflexes.As with all team-play based PVP games, you do get into bad teams - it is what it is, not the game's fault. But in general I think the community is decent.Graphics, music is fantastic, well optimized game. Servers are great, matchmaking is fast.Love of these magnificent ships can be certainly felt, there are dev-made historical videos on YT - there is a fair chance you will get interested in the topic.

And WG used this ""reason"" to chat ban me.OK, chat banned, no problem. So I contacted the supporting staff to remove the ban. Do they have the authority or ability to remove the ban? Sure, I have seen some other players' chat ban been relieved after contacting supporting guys. But this time, the supporting guy (A*** M*****) said they were incapable to remove chat bans.So that guy obviously lied about what they can do, and I pointed it out. You guess what happened? WG simply said, WG wouldn't talk about whether he lied or not, but two sentences twice per battle is SPAMMING and that deserves a chat ban.

This game has an excellent storyline and the characters are amazing especially the main protagonist. This game is also beautiful with it's vibrant world and monsters that will keep you amazed throughout your exploration. Everything here feels cinematic and will keep you invested to this game. The only main problem with this game is probably the gameplay, enemies are kind of annoying and unforgiving (Especially at the beginning), and the combat is pretty stiff.

The game overall is great, you can definitely play it for free, but you will have to put in alot of work. The lower tiers are sheer fun, you will find as you get above IMO tier 8-10.

b73d3c6e-4564-4cdc-9016-c8992f829cef,4,"I've been playing this game extremely casually for the past years, that means a few hours a day to once every 2-3 months.I have to say this is the best naval battles game out there by far, if there even is a competitor. If you are drawn to it by KantaiCollection like me, you will marginally be disappointed but nevertheless still impressed by it, and hey the mods can fix your addiction, even through the mods are of extremely poor quality, the limitations placed on them are a factor i presume, for me slapping kancolle(and other) art on ship skins is indeed poor quality.While all is good and the game is satisfying to play, WarGaming themselves are taking it in the wrong direction since the beginning and that shows, part of it has to do with insane 40 to 60 euro prices for ONE premium ship, the only vanilla skin in the game so far is the Bismark skin which you cant get anymore, and camouflages which are a consumable that pretty much ruin the look of ships to me. They have done a good job with the Halloween event ship skins for one mission available during halloween, but that is it. Personally i feel like ships skins and maybe even voice packs(preferably in cooperation with kantai collection team) would be the right direction instead of ultra expensive ships.Okay aside from that, you got premium account benefits which frankly are equivalent to nothing. Let me put it like this, the major problem you will inevitably face is buying a new ship which requires EXP obtained only and only by the previous ship in a line of tiers to unlock the next tier, and game currency to buy the next ship. The EXP itself is a massive grind you have to go through at high tiers, especially for casual players ( i play for 2 and now close to 3 years casually and i still only just got to tier 9 out of 10, getting to 10 is much harder due to: read on), and CREDITS(game currency) the game offers you a insane ammount at the start to buy your ships, this will take you to atleast tier 7 maybe as you get some from grind too. Now heres how it works, you get credits, like exp, from participating in battles(grinding) roughly around 50k to 100k on a good game, and lets be real you wont be as good as youtubers of this game and be the carry to get a more than that, the problem again rises when you reach tiers 8,9,10 where the cost(yes there is a credits cost) to enter a battle with X ship is pretty much higher than the credits reward for winning/losing the battle, this becomes extremely obvious with tier 9 ships where even if you win, if you plaid poorly you are still in the negative... so... the tiers at which the game is most fun, the developers pretty much said no to that.Now what im getting at is premium account time MARGINALLY fixes this, you get more EXP per battle so theres less grind, and more money and lower deployment cost(participating in game) this basically makes it like this, people say its efficient for non premiums to farm with tier 5-6 for money to buy and play tier 9-10 ships, and this is an insane grind ( i forgot to mention credit costs to buy ships go from 5 million at lower tiers to over 10 million credits for tier 9 or 10 )  so instead, with premium account time, you can farm money with tier 6-7 without losing money if you dont win the game.Theres EXP conversion cost which means you convert EXP accumulated with a ship ( the one you grind with duh ) to something called Free EXP that can instead be used to unlock ( and then buy if you got the credits ) any ship, this costs real money currency and the same system is in place for commanders and resetting commander skills (im not going to get into this) both of which have a decent cost, but the cost being decent is a direct result of how insane the grind has to be in the first place, which is not a good thing. On top of which you dont outright buy Free exp, commander EXP.. etc, you first grind it and pay to convert it to, hopefully, be used on buying t9 and 10 only.All in all a very great core game with rotten wargaming elements, i do recommend it because its extremely satisfying to play, the explosion sounds which they keep improving, that time you get citadel hits(massive dmg) all is very fun to play and everyone should give it a try.",Mon Sep 28 02:06:27 EEST 2020,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

e6f4547a-084e-46d4-a407-4365b1240b66,3,"Having played a little more than 1000 fights on the main account, I could not miss the output of this game on the expanses of my favorite Steam.Wargamng, as a developer company, came to the gaming industry from the 90s of the last century and this left a strong imprint on the thinking of top managers and the designer's decisions taken under their pressure.In particular, WOWs is developed by third-party Lesta, but tries in all to copy the tanks WG, and maybe not worth doing it.We have the same 10 levels of technology, with most of the ships in the branch practically repeating each other, not only by contours, but also by weapon configurations. For example, all Japanese cruisers from level 5 have a 203 mm caliber of guns, all Americans are 150 mm, and so on.It is clear that it is very difficult to think up differences of similar ships in general, so that the user has a feeling that they are all different, but why then as many as 10 levels.In addition to not understanding why a ship similar in general costs twice as much as it is at a higher level, the balancer throws all the players with a difference of 2 levels of technology in one battle.Those. 5 lvl plays with 7 lvl, 7lvl with 9lvl and so on. Beginners suffer and are angry with the developers. To all other things, the modules of the purchased ship are initially rather weak, and when buying tops the ship, as a rule, is transformed. Gets penalties for perks and a transplanted captain.As a result, the player swims with a slow recharge, turn of the steering wheel and other joys of life and the development of developers in vain.Why this was doing and injuring the players, it is unclear. Maybe the developers themselves were traumatized in their childhood and they harbored resentment?It was possible to make 3 levels - beginners, everything that floated before the 2nd world, middle class - the most massive second world and paper projects like high-level content for clans, etc.As a result, new players enter the game and set themselves a goal to pump the conditional Yamato, for which it is necessary to collect more than 1,000,000 experience points. At the same time, there are both playable ships in the branch, as well as frank cacti, which the developer is rumored to introduce, so that players pass them for free experience through donate.Rushing up to Yamato, it becomes obvious that it was just a trap of developers, because the game on it, as on any top ten gives a stable minus even with a premium account. As a result, in order to ride on the top you need to farm silver on the ships, and this is a separate topic.Regarding the prema, I still do not get tired of being surprised by the logic of the WG. You make a technique that, according to the logic of your game, users will have to play the lion's share of time, to accumulate money and experience on it and to pump the captain.Why, then, does the technician necessarily have a flaw that makes it uncomfortable with respect to conventional ships.Why am I buying a tank or a ship for $ 50 I do not get a sense of advantage, and even vice versa.Separately, I want to say that the premium strategy is also used by the VG to replenish online at certain levels of the game with intent. In brief I will say that in the game 2 comfortable levels of technology - 4LVL and 7Lvl.4 level is comfortable, because by the mechanics of the game it throws a maximum against 5, so you will not have much superiority over you. Especially since level 5 throws on the feed to 7, so on the four you will often play in the top or among the brethren.7 level is comfortable because although it throws to the nines, but there are not enough of them in the rand, since it is economically unprofitable to play them. Therefore, he often plays against 8 prizes or even in the top.It would seem that in this scenario, it is enough to buy 4 or 7 Prem and calmly farm on it with a high percentage of victories. And now we open a premium store and what we see. At 4 corpses only 1 premier battleship Ichizuchi - absolutely unplayable ship, which is worse than classmates in everything. Battleship without armor, which also removed the range.At level 7 there are 3 destroyers, two cruisers and a German battleship. There are 2 more aircraft carriers, on which the gameplay is very specific. Battleship is not bad, if you do not take into account its 283 mm guns. The destroyers are generally good, but it is understandable that Main players will not choose them. Cruisers I generally believe in this game is garbage.The main vehicles are located at the least comfortable 6 and 8 levels. Playing at 6 you will constantly fall against 8 levels and feel complete impotence. Playing 8 will use you to feed damage to 10 lvls. That is, when buying 8 premi it is necessary not to rejoice, but to grieve, since you will not see any comfortable game on it for a long time.After all the nagging above there is a logical question, why do I recommend this game, whether it is worth it to play at all.The fact is that in my games I first of all are interested in the process of cognition, understanding of game mechanics, choosing the most effective options for gaining an advantage over the enemy. And WOWs all this generously provides.The key parameter is the percentage of wins, it shows how many fights your team has won.And although it may seem that the victory of a team of 12 people does not depend on the efforts of one person, but this is not so.The fact is that playing well and influencing the battle can significantly increase the chance of winning your team and have the status 60+ in a solo game.Here is the implementation of this task and keeps me in the game, makes it interesting for me.How to achieve this task?First of all, one must understand that the current level system is broken and not all classes of ships in this game are equally good. In other words, 95% of the ships are frank garbage.Of those that are even good, many are not suitable for the game because of the uncomfortable level of fighting, for example, 5.6.8 levels are not suitable due to the +2 level of combat. 10 are not suitable because of the negative economy. There are 4, 7 and the ninth levels.On the 4th level, Izyaslav and Isokadze are good ships.In the seventh, almost everything, depending on the style of the game.On the ninth I did not play, but I can highlight Missouri as a prem with good stats, to which one should strive to accumulate free experience in an amount of sky-high 7500000.Regarding the role in battle - the destroyers affect the fight very much, as the meaning of this game is in capturing points and gaining advantages over points.The success of the game depends on whether you can live to the end of the battle, while doing considerable damage and not getting it in response, grabbing the points and not letting the enemy do it.It is of course important to kill, but since the size of the cards is large, you can kill a lot and still lose on points.As a match, I really like the game, it allows you to think, make informed decisions during the battle and enjoy the result.

af98d66d-b7dc-4323-a1e7-c43e9da225ea,10,What a fun game. Haven't spent a cent either and have enjoyed 10 hours over the last week. Great game for an aging chap like myself that still likes the competitiveness of multiplayer but just doesn't have the reflexes to play FPS's anymore. One of the better gaming experiences I have had in the last year.

There not asking $2 to buy a really good battle ship. There asking prices like $60 and up real money. I can buy a new game for that much and just lose interest in this game. The way it is set up it reminds me of an app game you download on your phone. You have to keep paying real money for the best upgrades. I will play the game for a wile but when i actually have to buy the game I will find a different game. Just because of you have to pay real money for better battleships which everything should be included in the games actual price when it fully releases.

It has a relatively long time to kill unless you're an idiot and serve up the broadside of your ship to a wall of torpedos, or a Yamato. It's all about paying attention to everything that's going on and always thinking four or five steps ahead, because it takes that long for a ship to get anywhere or do anything.Pretty annoyed Wargaming didn't support linking to existing accounts with the steam version (I confirmed by contacting support), but see the video on youtube about it by Ichase for a workaround.

The dev's seem to have made very little effort to compress the game size. War Thunder is literally half the size of this game, and it has hundreds of unique aircraft tanks and maps, and all vehicles handle differently, some have modeled interiors and their armor and piercing is simulated. I don't understand why this game takes up so much space. There are quiet a few ships but nowhere near the amount of other games. No campaign or large amounts of dialogue.

There are some bad reviews regarding that you can't play your old account on steam and what they don't know is that all you have to do is change the Steam file ""Steam_api"" by adding a ""2"" infront of file's name to play with your old account and there some youtube videos in where you can find it and change it.There are four classes of ship Battleships (BB), Carriers (CV), Destroyers (DD), and Cruisers (CL/CA) and there is Premium ships for all four classes of ship. Also if you want to get premium ships they do rotate premium ships by Tech tree refreshers in January and September every year otherwise the other way to obtain them is by limited time sales. Ships like the Arkansas can't be purchased, and OP ships like the Konig Albert and the Nikolai can't be purchased at all.For Carriers I Recommend playing Tier 4-5 carriers first in PvP/PvE and and practicing strafes with fighters and Alt attacks with Strike aircraft in Tier 6 with PvE first before being commited to carriers in PvP. There are youtube videos to help you be a better CV player in the game.When you are in Destroyers and Cruisers and have torpedoes (this also includes battleships with torpedoes) look at your torpedo range first before going into battle and also be careful launching your torpedoes when allies are near as if your not careful by these two things you'll be accidently teamkilling your own team and you'll turn pink at one point playing these ships.Battleships are a classes that relies on their main guns doing all the work and have the armor to soak up damage. AP by fare does more damage than HE, but HE does create more fires. Use AP for broadsides and when the enemy BB is angled bow on towards you use HE unless you are in a Yamato. Not every Battleship has the same armor, take the tier 5 American battleship New York for example, it uses the all or nothing armor concept, to do heavy damage towards all or nothing Battleships in a Battleship hit the area of the aft and stern and between the aft/Stern and citadel to do maxium damage there. When fighting ships like the Bismarck that has the Turtleback armor scheme, it's more difficult getting citadeled at close range but in return it's vulernable to plunding fire. One trick in fighting ships like the bismarck in a battleship is instead of aiming at the waterline aim a little higher towards the upper belt you'll do a more damage there. If in a Cruisers or Destroyer use HE unless you have torpedoes to use against the BB. I don't want to make my review too long, this game is great but it does have it's flaws but I do recommend it.",Sun Feb 21 00:11:27 EET 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

More important is that the tier system is separating the beginners from the more deeply involved (play-time) players, which is a good thing. There are sometimes people not playing 'by the book' and we loose. Sometimes that person is me, othertimes not. It's much about learning to play each class of ship, which have their own role and characteristics. Having someone equally advanced as you by your side is more fun than playing against much easier or much harder opponents.The challenges in this game is, however, not the gear, but the strategy (overall plan) and the tactics (battles). There is an invisible range from enemy ships you should try not to cross too far alone, if so, you will sink before you know it, especially if several ships target you.  Observe the range where others may detect you and the range of your main artillery. Also, keep an eye at the map now and then, to avoid being trapped alone against many.This is a not so social game. After playing almost 200 games, very few has reached out to me with messages.

You never feel underpowered even on tier 1. You can always outsmart and outthink when outgunned. Something that WOT will never be able to do. Nor War Thunder. But still... endless death matches. That can only last so much.- Competent on sound, graphics and what not, but it's mainly a dead game if want to PVP. Most of the times it's you against one other guy with a team filled with bots. The bots put up a good challenge, but it gets boring real quickly though. TL:DR It's free. You ain't losing a thing by trying. Just don't get lured by the Siren's song and start to drop cash on this.

You know before many conflicts whether you have engaged on superior footing or lesser than your opponent(s). This is because the pace of entering most conflicts(for the observant, and discarding careless play) is very casual and the pace of the combat itself is relaxed. When you are winning or loosing a conflict, you are already reflecting on earlier parts of the conflict - positioning, speed of entry, bearing of your guns, state of your torpedos or repair kits or smoke bombs, the decisions you made to enter the conflict at all based on your vehicle, nearby allies' vehicles, proximity to allies and the enemies, and the types of vehicles the enemies are in. It's a learning experience to loose, and like writing out a trig proof to win. The proofs available are different by every feature of an encounter. You grow your knowledge of the proofs by loosing a specific setup, and thinking about what variables could've been changed to make it either avoidable, escapable, or beatable. You also think about the other side of it - how you could embrace a certain set of variables for an assault, and how you could do it better or support it if an ally attempts it.",Tue Sep 28 12:43:47 EEST 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

However, the PvE has something I personally couldn't stand which ruined the experience for me as someone that isn't after competitive gameplay. The Ai destroyers are immune to torpedo hits, they phase through the ship but if a player uses one.. torpedo's can hit and almost sink your destroyer immediately. I have watched the Ai, they do a fairly good job of dodging even though they can't be hit in the first place. The immunity is absurd and unnecessary.",Sun Dec 19 08:49:56 EET 2021,7538609a-a5e1-47e9-9b84-f27b650d683c

e067500f-e3da-43d9-a093-437e8e88602c,2,"think this game is great, and am suprised to see the reviews are fairly mixed. The game runs smoothly on my pc wich is a fairly old and cheap one, looks good, sounds good, plays good and doesnt have many bugs. The gameplay reminds a bit of a moba, but then again, not quite. Also reminds a bit of chess, in real time, where every piece is controlled by one person, but then again, not quite.A standard battle has a 12v12 setup and when you die, you're gone. You either win by killing the other team, or you win by points - you get points from capture points and from kills, and loose points when team mates die. Every match has a limit of 20 minutes but often ends earlier. To be good at the game you mainly need situational awareness, and the ability to plan ahead, as well as accurately see what you opponents will do. It's also a fairly causual experience, there is 7v7 clan battle seasons, but the majority of your games will be ""random battles"" that just throw 12 people up against 12 other people with same classess and tiers of ships. You can group up with friends for these battles, but you are limited to groups of 3 people in each.You certainly can open up your wallet for this game, and you can be a whale too, but i dont think you need too. There are 10 tiers of ships and many ship trees that are all free. You first start with a very basic tier 1, get some experience with that then you get you buy (with in game currencies) the next tier ship in that line and so on. Every new tier introduces more game mechanics so the game gets harder the more you play, as higher tier ships only duke it out with other high tier ships. In the first tiers its +-1 tier, but when you reach tier 5 its +-2 tiers, meaning tiers 5s can be matched up against tier 7s. I see alot of reviews say this is a bad thing, but i dont really think so. Remember, every team has the exact same number of ships with the exact same classess and tiers. If you are a tier 5 destroyer there will be a tier 5 destroyer on the other team also. And a tier 5 ship can defiently outplay any tier 7 ship, you are just in a slightly worse ship. But I do think many players hit a wall at around tier 5 as alot of better players enjoy the mid tiers, and the lower tiers are full of noobs. That combined with more punishing game mechanics the higher you get up the trees could make your first tier 5 a rough experience. If you wanna progress quicker in the trees there is premium account time for sale, which could cost you 10 euros for a month, or less the more time you buy at once. (I just bought 12 months for 40 euros, but that was during a sale). There are also ships outside of the skill trees that are called premium ships, that you can only get from buying them directly. They have their benefits but are overall as good as the free ships, with a couple of exceptions (some premiums are hitting around 55% win rate on average). Over all I would not recommend buying any premiums when you start out, especially high tier ones. If you hop in a high tier ship as a noobie you get paired with others in high tier ships that knows the game and you will get absolutely smashed. So yeah, over all great game. Probably a bit different to what you are used to. It's mostly a mind game, your super quick counter strike reflexes and pin point accuracy wont really help you here.

e067500f-e3da-43d9-a093-437e8e88602c,9,The automatic team damage punishment system is utter garbage. Using a battleship at range can easily get you ban for many sessions as even if a ships sails in front of your shots it is always your fault. Ships sometimes sail along side you and you can easily shoot them if aiming down the scope which is the majority of the game. I've actedentally run into friendly torpedos yet the game counted it as his fault. I can only imagine how many games he was ban for. With no way to forgive damage or appeal it the game would be better off without friendly fire.,Sun Oct 10 10:55:46 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84
00de3e8f-27fb-4051-ae81-fbe41965e885,7,"I give this a thumbs up, but I would say that's because between the pros and cons you come to about a 51-49% ratio... It's a decent game to play around with, though highly annoying even for the full time streamers i see play the game. Biggest con in the game I would say is just how LUCK based it is. Now they will go on and on about their aiming system. But in reality it seems to be extremely luck based. I'll explain a bit. Most of the games i have played i seem to HALO about 90% of the time, while the other team seems to hit me with at least 5 shots of a 6 round burst at least 75% of the time. So the aiming works by creating an oval, the shots all land somewhere in the oval depending on LUCK. Now if you lock onto someone it is supposed to shrink this oval and if you're closer it also shrinks it. Funny thing is it never seems to matter. I have had shipps completely broad side to me and i hit on every ♥♥♥♥ing side but not 1 shot lands on the damn ship. I have had them nose at me and same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Of course shooting a ship coming straight at you should be harder, but when the enemy is attacking me like i said they seem to have about 75% accuracy regardless of the direction im going. Hell even when im playing a destroy class and continuously rotating around theyre hitting with most their shots.Now either 90% of the players are cheating and the creaters aren't doing a damn thing about it. Or their firing system is mostly luck based. However, if you can deal with that bs then you should be fine. I see many big streamers playing this game and they get irritated at how much they halo compaired to other ships too so I know it's not just me. It also seems to have severally increased how good AA is to the point that 1 bombing run of torps or bombers literally killed every one of the jets... And since carriers barely carry any ships (at least to teir 5) it's extremely pointless to even play as a carrier anymore. This can be noticed by how many games I play that are completely without carriers, and how when you are queing up the carrier que is typically at a 0... Kinda sad that you made a class completely pointless, when in real life carriers pretty much own everything. However, even with my negatives the overall fun I have had with this game out weighs the extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ portion to it. I keep playing, though if they fixed the game I would probably put a lot more time into this one over other games.",Thu Jul 08 08:12:39 EEST 2021,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6
00de3e8f-27fb-4051-ae81-fbe41965e885,7,"This game is a straight up RNG engine. You need to have some skill to participate in that engine, i.e. if you're not good you won't get the chance to get lucky or unlucky with shots at all and you'll simply miss, but even when you figure out ranging, leading, etc. you'll often find two shots from the same cannon drifting above AND below the target at the SAME TIME! Entire broadsides fired together will somehow fall inches from the target on every side without touching it. And sometimes every shot will hit. Totally up to the drift RNG. But even better, particular locations on the ship are critical hits (called the citadel) if you penetrate the armor. Taking the drift into account, you can aim for them, but outside close range it is, of course, relatively random whether you hit this spot or not. Whether you penetrate the armor or not is, you guessed it, more RNG. But what makes this REALLY great is on top of all that, if it DOES hit the citadel, and if it DOES penetrate the armor, the damage is utterly catastrophic, taking off up to 50% of your health per shell. Not a battleship shell to a destroyer. A battleship shell to a battleship. Same weight class. 50%. Gone. Just like that. Completely. At. Random.But what's even MORE fun? On top of all that, there is a tiny, tiny percentage chance that any given shot will hit your magazine. So more RNG for more massive damage.The practical upshot of all this is while there is a significant amount of skill involved, and the chances of it happening to you at any given time are low, you can (and do) intermittently just explode for no reason. You can be winning a duel by a LOT and then a lucky, single shell, fired as a parting shot from a fleeing foe with a broken rudder and a burning deck, will completely obliterate you.So to be completely fair, that doesn't happen much. But it does happen, and when it does it's pretty much the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ever. Basic citadel hits, which are far more common, are still pretty obnoxious, as there's little you can do about them.So basically, skill is involved, but not really the ultimate deciding factor. If you enjoy randomly exploding, play this game. If you don't... Well, if you're really into ships then give it a try for the good looking models and see for yourself. But if you're not into ships, just give it a pass. It's not a good enough game to reccomend to anybody who isn't a Pacific Theatre nerd.

00de3e8f-27fb-4051-ae81-fbe41965e885,0,"I like it so far but there do seem to be serious issues. First I couldn't play it through steam. When i downloaded it through steam it kept saying your game does not match the server version. I had to download the war games launcher from the game website, then link the launcher game folder to the steam game folder and splice the files. It took me a few days to figure that out. If i launch it through steam It brings me to a different profile not the wargames one. So that is why i only have .7 hours, although I do only have about 5 or 6 anyway. So far I would say it is fun, but my highest ship is tier 3, I'm like a thousand exp away from 4. I was pushing my way to a carrier but after seeing other reviews i am rethinking that decision. So far this is way less frustrating than world of tanks and warthunder. A lot less dying and it at least seems that the matches are mostly balanced. I hated when in world of tanks you would roll out then immediately get one shot by a premium tank three tiers higher than you with a bunch of premium buffs. I am sure I am going to hit a pay wall quite soon, but the game does seem nice enough where I am actually considering buying something. Probably when i hit the inevitable pay wall round tier 6. Over all I'd say give it a try. Just hide your wallet for a while because the options to buy are shoved in your fave and are quite tempting. It is quite fun in lower tiers so just play it till it pisses you off then uninstall, worked for world of tanks and all the games like this.",Wed Nov 13 05:33:44 EET 2019,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

669652b0-987b-4fe5-be3a-21325595ac7a,4,"I removed my first review only to pretty much repost it...the game still stands as nothing short of an epic waste of time unless you just enjoy wasting your time in which case have at it!To get up to the higher tiers and play with some of the well known ships that may have drawn you in to begin with just prepare to spend at least (no joke here either) 3-5 months getting there unless you can managed to find a group of players that you can join in with and go to the pvp side of things and ACTUALLY win to earn more other than joining those battles only to have such a crap team of 'randoms' as well as being guarenteed to be go up against a group of people who are organized and ready for the fight with high ranking captains with proper skills, signals to buff and paint to cause you to miss more....you can go ahead and tell yourself that you can just get the same stuff on a ship and beat them however when there are 3 of them working together against you...LOL..yeah right, teamwork will always win as history tells us. So thus leading you to play mostly in that lovley Co Op area until you can get a friend to play with or find one in game...but then again it's a free to play game so you'll find mostly children or the mental equivilent of a child when you need to have at least some tactical awareness in this VERY SLOW PACED game that heats up VERY QUICKLY only to end sometimes too fast or not fast enough...rarely do I ever find a truly Fun round.I can also just see the responses from those who defend this game religiously because they paid money for a ship and got ripped off thus they feel obligated to defend their 'investment' hahahahahahahIf anyone wants a quick idea of how much Real World money they want for a ship, the USS Arizona (BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST WELL REKNOWN SHIPS ON THE PLANET EARTH) is a tier 6 (maybe 7 I can't recall right now) and is a superior version to the it's counterpart that you can earn in game without needing real money. I first looked in to the price of it expecting maybe a $20 price tag perhaps pushing $30....OH NO! First you have to buy the in game currency which is only sold in certain bundles of ammounts and then you can spend that currency on the ship, also you don't get ANY REFUNDS once you buy this in game currency even if you don't use it. Well to wrap it up they wanted me to buy either a $60 bundle to have enough of the in game currency to just buy the USS Arizona however it would leave me with some extra that I have no use or desire for at all, I don't even want a spare crate or an extra ship slot at all just the ship....but no I have to over spend just to get what I want. Or I can spend around $45 on a few seperate bundles to get...yet again...just a few extra in game currency bits that I DON'T WANT. It's very kind of them to try and help you spend your money for you!Oh yeah don't forget that ALL of the purchaseable ships (Real World Money that is) are given so many extra buffs that a standard free to play player CAN NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO that don't only give some aid to the player who bought the ship as way of thanking them for the purchase (which I can understand) but they also give them in game advantages against you and your abilites making you a less lethal opponent...and they spent money to get that buff...I believe that's called PAY TO WIN. What a lame game this crap still is....it'll be dead in probably 1 year...2 if it's lucky hahahahahahh",Mon Nov 09 11:17:27 EET 2020,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024
669652b0-987b-4fe5-be3a-21325595ac7a,9,"Early Access ReviewSo, the developers wanted to divide Steam accounts (that give Valve a %) and non Steam accounts... They say is because of the game not being ""cross platform"" which is a lie, specially on PC when Steam can work as a launcher to launch the standalone game... So here is the thingThe game IS good, I do recommend it, however if you want to play with your old Wargaming account, here is what you need to do:1. Download the game2. Go to the directory it downloaded and delete steam_api.dll3. Open the game (if you had the standalone version, move the preferences.xml file to the directory so you get the login and config automatically)4. Log in and enjoy playing thru SteamHere is the thing, doing this WILL NOT allow you to pay with Steam currency, so you got to buy stuffs with direct purchases inside the game; if they release achievements YOU WILL NOT be able to get them (you can always use SAM to unlock those achievements, keep in mind, it's not fair nor ""legal"", do it at your own risk)So, why would you do this? You can do this to play your old account, while keeping the Steam overlay without any issue (adding the standalone version may cause some issues), have access to the community inside Steam, easier to have screenshots and share them, KEEP THE GAME UPDATED AUTOMATICALLYIf, in the future, they add Steam Trading cards, YOU WILL NOT, be able to get them, since this is a F2P game you need to spend money in their shop to get them...

Ships from 20 years apart are forced to fight each other with enormous imbalances and a tier 5 will face tier 7s every other match.High tier gameplay is mostly boring campfests at long range because moving close gets someone instantly focused on the wide open maps.Aircraft carriers are both boring to play (like the world's worst RTS game) but also game-breakingly overpowered, with infinite fuel planes that launch 30 in 10 seconds (unlike a real carrier where it would take hours to get every single plane out of the hangar, moved up on deck and launched one at a time.) Because of the joke matchmaking, an aircraft carrier can fight a 1910 ship that does 0 DPS to airplanes because it got time-traveled by the terrible russian developer. Airplanes can drop torpedoes from solid cliff faces or 1 inch of water and there are no water-tight compartments on ships in-game, so a ship that could float without the nose and without the rear in real life will auto-die to 1 tiny section flooding with water after extinguishing a fire. Carriers average the damage of 3-4 combat ships but can stay hidden in spawn behind a cliff all game long with no risk.It's okay to play free, but do not expect the company to improve the game. They haven't made CVs either realistic or balanced in several years of being out.",Mon Mar 15 05:21:16 EET 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

This is a good game if you like casually blowing stuff up while intoxicated, or you really like boats, or you found World of Tanks too fast-paced. But if you're expecting a polished product? No. Interface is extremely clunky, game mechanics are completely non-competitive, and controls do not work as intended.Controls feel really clunky compared to Navy Field, Stellar Impact, and Hyperbol. Turrets cannot be grouped or toggled and the controls are unresponsive. No matter how hard you try to master the controls, the keyboard has been nerfed to be on-par with the console controller. This plays like the PC port of a console game.And why is the scatter so bad? I've played cardgames with less RNG (randomness). I'd heard that the random accuracy and nerfed torpedoes and nerfed aircraft were bad, but making accuracy nonexistent at close ranges?? Real life shells can't have that much spread or they wouldn't make it through the artillery's barrel! If you don't want your shots careening off at random 30° tangents then... Good luck.Queueing up an ammo switch reloads ALL guns after ONE gun fires a shot, instead of queueing each reload individually. Turret rotation fights against the player and EVERY turret turns so slowly that any turret out of line of sight is actively working to sabotage the player's damage output. The mouse cursor rotates all turrets at once, shift-X rotates all turrets at once, P does not disable turret rotation, and there is no way to select turrets or group your turrets. The only way to disable your turrets is by aiming outside their turn radius, or by frustratedly trying to fire while turning, because quickly turning your ship and turrets in opposite directions will prevent them from firing! (Even if you hold down the mouse for sequential fire.) Remember not to ammo swap, because it puts ALL turrets on cooldown!Allied bots will actively torpedo you, and the vast majority of your teammates in PvP will be bots, because matchmaking is newwwbie-friendly ;) and to be extra redundant, if you want to tryhard and play aircraft carrier then you're not allowed to manually control your aircraft (at tiers 4 & 5) because god-forbid having RESPONSIVE CONTROLS THAT LET YOU OUTPLAY YOUR OPPONENT!Locking turret rotation, normalizing the projectile spread at short range, and debugging sequential fire & reloading - these would make the game somewhat immersive.

The human enemies ai need to be reworked though as they are very easy to kill even on hard.  Well worth experiencing from beginning to end.

9731c7c4-64ae-488c-aa29-5a7d64e15976,4,"(UPDATED)So, I've logged a Large Amount of Hours into this Game and feel it's time to give my personal Opinion of it. I'll do it in Bullet form so it's Easier to find.COMBAT-Everyship has a Role to play. Carriers are there to Dominate the Air and Provide extra Means to sink/Spot Enemies. Battleships are the Tanks. Large HP and can deal massive amounts of Damage when your Main Battaries find their Mark. Cruisers provide Support Fire and help Defend the Larger Ships from Air Attacks. Destroyers are both Amazing and Annoying. Their Torpedoes can destroy a Ship in seconds, which both Benifits and Hurts you. If you see Torpedoes heading torwards you, either try to avoid them or pray they don't cause too much Damage. You have to Lead your Shots, failing to do so will result in a Wasted Shots. But combat seems Fair and has some Stratigy to it.So, now the Grind. Early on you'll notice that Ship's XP Requirement getls High, and I mean HIGH! Like a few days for one Ship kind of High. It wouldn't be so bad if they allowed Ship XP to be shared between Ships, basically negating Free XP (That can be shared but little is aquired). Also, you can't just start out with a Battleship, no you gotta work your way up, From Cruisers to Battleships, Battleships to Carriers. It is a bloosy Grind. My Suggestion? Go Player Versus Player, Yah you get some Coward Tactics but you get a lot more Bang for your Buck. Also, have 2-3 of the Same Ship. That way if you sink in Battle, you can still use another ship to get XP and since they are the same XP is stored on Each one for all use.Next... every Gamer's most HATED 2 Words... MICRO TRANSACTIONS!!!! Now, I hate EA with a Burning Passion.... but at least they don't charge you $60 for a f***ing Premium Ship! A Unique Tier 7 Battleship will cost around 12,000 Dubloons, which can cost you at least $60 just to buy a package. That is asinine. Add to the fact it NEVER is a High Tier 10 Ship, meaning it's the Best Ship for that Catagory/Nation. Since most ""Premium Ships"" are Tier 7-+, that means they aren't even the Strongest by Default. Yah, they maye have slightly different Stats, and have a ""Unique"" Paint Scheme, but NOT worth the $60",Wed Apr 15 02:00:42 EEST 2020,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

94d3a6c5-2c36-4b85-88cb-f7ae4b325450,0,"This game is phenominal. Disregard any reviews that have less than 100 hours as they honestly haven't learned the game yet. It will take a lot of time to get the aiming in this game down, as every ships guns have different shell velocity or ""bullet speed"" and you will almost always have to lead your target. There is a lot of important information that the game doesn't tell you and this creates a learning curve that confuses and scares off a lot of people. You are almost certainly going to have to learn the mechanics via the wiki or online forums, but it is worth the time invested. There is a very long grind to get to a tier 10 ship (ships tiers range from 1-10 and the higher the tier the stronger the ship essentially) but it makes it that much more rewarding to get a t10. It took me around 100 hours to get my first t10 and it will take you more or less time depending on how quickly you learn the game and if your willing to shell out for premium.That brings us to the way the game is monetized. This game is free to play but has a subscription in the form of ""premium status"". All premium status does is give you a 50% boost to exp earned after each game as well as a credits earned boost. 50% is a huge boost yes, but you can most certainly play and progress without it. You also can get free premium status through events and the weekly operation. If you 5 star the weekly operation it will give you 24 hours of premium. So if you are free to play try and grind hard when you get that free day of premium every so often.There are also premium ships in this game that can be bought with real money. What most people don't mention though is that these are just slightly different versions of free-to-play ships that are better in some areas and worse in others. Also  premium ships only go up to tier 8. You can not directly buy any ship above tier 8 and you can't progress to higher tiers by playing them. This basically means that at the highest levels of play (tier 10) you arent going to see any premium ships. And if you do see them then they are at a huge disadvantage, as they are gonna be 2 tiers under you.I very much suggest atleast trying this game if you are interested. But do note, that you are gonna need a friend to help you along or you are gonna be in for some reading online.",Wed Apr 01 20:07:41 EEST 2020,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

9b80663b-c3fb-4beb-9ba5-db02392fbc77,4,"Early Access ReviewI want to recommend this game, but I can’t. In its current state, it needs way too much work to be worth your time and money. I've been playing the game since the closed beta, and have well over 2500 battles since the closed beta reset. [EDIT] [I'm coming back to this review to address developer responses and update based on the current state of the game. I plan to do this every 3-6 months. An edit will appear in brackets. as of February 2018, many of my original points still stand, but I wanted to address the developer comments as well because the developers argue against my review.]Let’s start with the good:+Arcade battles allow for quick play, and make it constant action+The gameplay itself is rather fun, and the progression through the lines gives you a sense of accomplishment and goals+When a battle is well-balanced vertically and horizontally, the results make for a fun and engaging battle where while every team member counts, you can sway the battle in your favor by good play.        +[The developers, after learning the hard way multiple times, are starting to engage with the community in a positive manner, instead of constantly arguing every point (if you are confused, see the response below.]However, these positives are overshadowed by the glaring flaws in the game:-Poor client optimization: I have a rather good computer, and the game constantly hangs and eats up an inordinate amount of power for comparatively mediocre graphics [2/18 The developers can of course disagree, but that doesn't make them right. I have an extremely good processor and a top-of-the-line graphics card. This computer can run VR without flinching. This computer can run ARK at 50-60 fps at 4K and max graphics. This game runs WoWs competitor WarThunder without a hitch. Warframe runs extremely well at 4K (with its plethora of particle effects and much more going on screen) and looks beautiful. Meanwhile, this game constantly hitches and completely lags out while in a menu or when you try to switch out a component on your ship. While the actual gameplay doesn't lag too much, the menu is unbearable, and you feel as though I'm dragging the game to play it in the menus. Something needs to give, whether it is a full engine upgrade, or a simple optimization of code (maybe not having to do a server call every time one presses a button in port)]-Steam is for new users only (while this is a minor complaint, it’s a giant middle finger to those who’ve played since closed beta and gets me to my last point) [2/18 While the developers have voiced their opinion and are not going to revisit it, it still is a flaw in the game. And yes, adding features and flags that are only for new players through steam that older, dedicated players cannot get is insulting to those players, and shows the value the developers place on older players.]-Ridiculous Price model puts “premium ships” around $25-$30 USD for a handful of pixels (and that is on the lower end) [2/18 Once again, though the developers ""have stated it many times before"", newer players should know that the premium ships are generally expensive. If the developers do not want to lower the price, that is their perrogative, but it might be a barrier to entry]-Premium accounts are about the only way to make your investment back at the highest tiers unless you have consistently great games (which you won’t) [2/18 Without a premium account, you can easily lose 100k-200k credits if you have a not-so-great game in a tier X ship, which discourages you from bringing them out and having fun in hitting the capstone in a ship line.]-And why yes, premium ships are overpowered, making the game unbalanced[2/18 Balancing a game is difficult, yes. And while I do admire the developers for not nerfing ships people paid money for, it does create problems. Recently, some ships like the Belfast were offered a refund because of a significant mechanic change. However, it does make things like ranked play difficult if there is an overpowered ship in the tier, because you can count on it being in your match. To be fair, the community does a lot of screeching if a preview of a premium is underpowered, but that is actually a better situation to introduce them underpowered rather than have an OP ship be untouchable.]Which brings me to the ugly:-The aircraft carriers (CVs) are completely out of whack, ruin the rock-paper-scissors balancing, and that one ship can ruin the entire match (There is a reason why carriers revolutionized naval warfare, and the game promotes a pre-carrier battle with aircraft carriers). If you CV captain forgot his brain at home, you will likely get blown up by the enemy CV, as there is little you can do to defend against enemy planes. [2/18 Grouping will likely not save you, unless you are in a clan match with a highly coordinated team. All you are left to do is either pray that there is no CV, or throw a bunch of AA on your ship, thereby gimping it and making it a problem. The AA spec everything is also not fun for the CV, as he just has to sit there and do almost nothing all game. Being a total wash should not depend on the grace of the matchmaker, but rather the skill of the team.]-Horizontal imbalance: ships from the same tier, but different nations are astoundingly out of whack.  [2/18 Once again, balancing is hard, but constantly throwing new mechanics in new ship/national lines makes your job more difficult.]-The power creep is real, and recently released ships pound their predecessors into the water. [2/18 Considering that a certain RN tier X BB nerf is in the works, the developers might be getting a bit more sensitive to this.]-Vertical imbalance: You will get overmatched in a battle, up to two tiers. A tier V battleship cannot take a tier VII battleship on a tier VII map. You end up either slow and irrelevant or blown to bits in one of the faster ships. [2/18 While Steam provided a slight increase in player base, it did not provide enough to alleviate the problem in middle tiers. Those players likely quit out of frustration, and might be lost to the void, leaving WoWs right at square one.]-Developer attitudes to player base are adversarial: they bully critical streamers into avoiding negative reviews, and are only remorseful when they are caught and the community backlash forces them to apologize. I’ve seen more customer cooperation from my internet provider and most US airlines. [2/18 This is a bit on the mend. Wargaming has avoided sticking their foot in it since November (an improvement in and of itself.) The developers and community outreach has been much more active on Reddit and their forums with Sub_Octavian. Further, Wargaming seems to have become more receptive to player feedback and are working on improvements. However, based on the developer responses (from November, so they might have improved) some old habits die hard, and instead of saying ""We're sorry you had problems, and thank you for giving us suggestions."" or ""While we know we have problems in our game, we are working to correct them."" we have a point-by-point argument or simple contradiction rather than an attempt at reconciliation. This is indicative of the attitude that can kill so many great games.]While I really enjoy this game, I can’t support it in its current form with its current development team. At such a high cost for its premium content, the flaws should have been fixed a year ago. It has a great base mechanic, but not having the support it deserves drives players like me away. I hope to someday give it a good review, but that is not today.[2/18 Unfortunately, there hasn't been enough improvement to the game for me to recommend it. Where there has been improvement, it has not been remarkable enough to change my attitude towards WoWs. I want to give this game a positive review, because there is so much potential, but  it is so frustrating to watch it get squandered.",Sun Aug 29 23:22:05 EEST 2021,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6

STO Does have a gambling system called the lockbox (pay $1.25 for 1 key, and drop chances are usually 1/500) which needs to be fixed and balanced, but is otherwise pretty good. In all the game does have a nice story arc, but needs more max level activities, due to the lack of things available to max level characters. I will be making some guides in the future for this game if anyone needs to learn some things such as how Inertia, or momentum affects starships and etc. I PERSONALLY rate this game 10/10! but beware pay to wins and pay to players, they will GREATLY have a massive advantage over you.Most star ships I will say, are pay to play, but it is ENITRELEY possible and quite easy to get one Especially during the anniversary event (via omega particles) buy buying your wanted ship from the exchange.

I understand some people complain about grinding, or about purchasing things etc. However, there are two things which make this formula acceptable, and here is why: the Devs continually modify and add to the game - they can't be expected to work for free. Secondly, in no way do you feel like you need to buy stuff with real money. If truth be told, most of what you might buy would either be some specific ships or extra docks (and of course, the EC cap). Sure, you can buy whatever else you'd like if you really want to, but you don't really need to. Considering that Zen is the currency which can be bought with real money, it should be noted that dilithium (an ingame only currency) can be obtained and then traded for Zen.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: PROS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Spock... is in the game. Leonard Nimoy's voice lives on in the game, alongside many, many other characters.Game mechanics are really good, and I consider them to be the norm on which any space game should be created upon.You can customize your characters with a fairly decent amount of costumes.An incredibly huge assortment of ships, and always growing.The Borg... as powerful as advertised in the shows and movies.Content has been either changed or removed/added in the past to improve the storyline.Every faction (Fed/Klingon/Rom) have a specific storyline until it merges.Each faction has a huge assortment of ships to select.Crafting system is extremely simple, and unique items can be obtained in such a way.Select whatever type of weapon types: phaser, disruptor, polaron, tetryon, anti-proton, plasma and other.Good voice acting.Global official giveaways - ships and items - and special events.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CONS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::The Borg... they drain your shields like it was nothing, and you can't do a thing about it - but that's also a Pro.Not as much content as I'd like.You do have to grind quite a bit, depending on what you want to achieve.The reputation system doesn't unlock every tier for every character once unlocked (this process is tedious), and takes 20 days at the very least, and 40 days initially (20 days once you obtain Sponsorship Tokens).Not enough costumes, hairstyles or beardstyles.Some specific characters cannot be modified, costume wise.Some races are not playable (yet), such as Cardassians, Breen, Vortas/Jem'Hadar, although you can usually create the look of most of them. Takes a while, of course.Personally, I have experienced frequent disconnects at some point (not always, but maybe once a month).Graphics are a bit dated, despite some improvements. Since game plays very well, and most players only care about space battles, it doesn't matter as much. ",Sun Aug 01 11:24:42 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84
dbd635e6-870b-4a28-a2f0-1df583b1f3a8,1,"Star Trek Online. Well, where to begin.Many people think this is ""PAY TO WIN"". This is not. Game contains ""premium"" ships and ""premium"" weapons, which are well balanced. Thing is, this game is very hard to master.To make it clear, I killed many battle cruisers and other battle ships with scientific ships. How?You need to have these skills.1) Combat strategy. You cant just fly straight to enemy and kill him, you have to find weakness, like slow turning speed, or slow weapon recharge and use it for yourself. There are many ways how to kill other player with ""premium ship"" because his ship cant turn so fast as yours, so you keep being away from his weapons firing range and still shoot at him.2) Buy/Sell strategy. You have to buy and sell weapons and other stuff. You have scientific vessel, its having great shields. Now you need weapons. You cant buy just any, you have to be sure they can fire effectively and you can shoot everywhere. Boost your shields or new weapon? There are many decisions about fitting your ship and buying new stuff. Premium weapons can make you ""OP"". But same can do weapons from market for ingame money.3) RPG skills for ground fight. I am bad at that.I think this game is great and I would recommend it to everyone.",Wed Sep 29 14:26:34 EEST 2021,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

dbd635e6-870b-4a28-a2f0-1df583b1f3a8,3,"For those people who like MMO RPG games and Star Trek. Head out and start star treking.Depends though however how you like to trek. Lets make one thing clear you dont play this game to explore. If you want to do that play bridge crew. This game is heavily focused on a kill or be killed Star Trek adventure. With many different weapons, both ground and space, and ships, one can not simply have enough. Is this game pay to win?Honestly not in the way you think. First off dont play PVP, as someone who has bought ships even I hate PVP, some people have death dreadnaught able to slam you while you barely dent them. However, PVE allows any ship from free to premium. Premium currency exists as well as loot boxes, no surprise as it is free to play. However, you dont actually need to buy any. Every Summer and every Winter there is an event that everyone can play and by doing a short mission everyday for a couple days you are given a free ship which is on level with the new one released all the time (T6 ship). Those ships however, are not as iconic as the ones you would get with premium currency. Now you can grind the premium currency but it will take you a very very long time. In that case it is pay for convenience. The loot box system is unintrusive, unless you are a ship collector with some ships going for exuberant prices. All in all I like this game. I feel that if it keeps up with its numbers it could last a while and with the introduction of another faction right around the corner, who knows how long we will be able to cruise the galaxy together.",Fri Jan 07 09:04:38 EET 2022,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

It is so in depth, I have put 70 hours into the game and im still finding stuff out. It is highly customisable from yourself to your ship to your ship crew.  The stories are excellent if your a fan of Star Trek which I am, theres loads of reference to all the franchises with episodes of time travel to get your origianl series fill.The ship battles are my favourite. This isn't Dota you have a full array of abilities to chose from, my Naga gets a lot of use. I am really enjoying the Science vessel it is my kind of play style and feels like a character in itself. There are hundred of different ways you can play the ships. Having a science vessel but then having a tactical team or a mix of all. You even chose the different officers on your ship which then opens up different abilities which you can choose from.You get duty officers alos which you can send on mission and this can level you, get skill points and dilithium.I havent finished learning the game, there seems like there is much more and they are always improving it and adding new seasons.",Tue Jun 15 21:12:00 EEST 2021,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

c76fe322-0d83-4417-95d3-109a39e3bd1f,4,"STO has... come a long way from when I first started this.At this moment, 5 years on, lots of changes, and I gotta say at least its moving in the right direction and worth it at least for that.I dunno, whenever it first went free to play, that's when I started this first. Long before I had Steam, back when it was vastly different than what I have seen now.Finding myself getting back to this gem was a nice refreshing taste of nostalgia - and a bit of dissapointment. Some of what I saw as the more fun and Trek-like gameplay is gone. Random missions is replaced with sporatic patrols that shift daily that you need to find. But despite the loss, there is so much more added I can really start to appreciate this game, and willing to admit I'm a lifer now. I've come back to this game time and time again - and it does hold an aspect that I see worth visiting.Many of the old, glitchy, unwanted parts (and I bet many of the negative reviews here are based on those) are long since gone. New elements have been added to help encourage a wider and more varried feel to the game. Many aspects have been added or changed to encourage development of really impressive improvements. R&D got an overhaul with the Duty Officers you gain, making it easier to earn good stuff - and add the possibility of making your own unique and impressive equipment. Bridge Officers have the ability to learn multiple skills, so you can have just a few favorites for the ideal team mix but still have the ability to shift what powers they use to simplify things in certain situations. Player Traits have been vastly overhauled. Parts of it I regret missing, you can't have an overpowered selection of a dozen or more Reputation traits powering you up - but you can now shift between selections in certain areas not in combat zones. And the mixing is balanced out well so far.You can make your captain and crew into what you dream here, in many surprising ways.But comes the only glaring problem I see - its an MMO. Its a kill or be killed area where damage is king. Grinding is a must and you gotta mow down mobs en masse. RP'ers will find some loss in certain builds and styles just not up to par - and if you want the top gear, you'll need to grind. And some grinds can't be done without a certain level of killing strength, so some things - just can't cut it. Doesn't feel very Trek at times. But I can't really call that a truly negative part at the moment.STO is Trek, just not the TV or Movie Trek. Its another Trek, in another galaxy. Another mirrored universe almost where you need to adapt to new enemies and threats. And face a hard truth. Kill or be killed.Outside of that, the game itself is showing an unbelieveable ammount of improvements over time. Focusing more on gameplay mechanics to help make enjoying the game easier. You just need to learn that over time.The Trek part? Well, its there. Cameoes, nods, and a great deal of effort in stories. But some of the later aspects really don't fit like I wish they did. But this isn't really the same Trek I would want it to be. Its not bad, just different. Can't honestly fault that anymore.Its a good MMO, with good merits and definetly something I could reccomend as you could find what you want in here somewhere - it certainly does have its size to go for it. That and the Foundry. Player-created content is a huge aspect of the game and if you got the time, you'll find a whole slew of additions to content and story that makes this game well worth the visit. The hard part is just finding it.But that's a bit of the charm. There is so much here, so much possibility. There is good, and bad - but overall, its trying a respectable rate to be better. I gotta admit that's worth it itself.Now the somewhat dated graphics and cartain core elements - well, that's just cause its an older game. But don't let that dissuade you here. You'll find something worth visiting, and even more worth coming back for. I know I have.",Wed Sep 29 05:21:29 EEST 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

62063908-73c4-43e1-9447-cf5830ff99b4,8,"I have been playing this game for a while now, and it has become one of my all-time favorites. Star Trek Online allows one to fulfill all of their dreams of having a role in Star Trek. You have the option of three (four if you count the semi TOS version of the Feds) options for your character, Federation, Romulans, and the Klingons. Many actors from the series have come on as voice actors to portray their characters. The game also allows you to progress from and Ensign to a Fleet Admiral (Using Federation ranks). As for the gameplay itself, you have a ship on ship combat and away team combat. The ship combat can be as complicated as you want it, you could spam fire all weapons, or set up loadouts and your crews abilities and tailor your actions to each combat scenario. The ground combat is from a third person perspective and is more of a point and click type of conflict than anything else. So far, I have not had an issue with repetitively because of foundry missions. These are missions created by other players, and some are very good. The missions that are produced by the developers are usually good. However, there may be a few bad ones that you may want to take advantage of the ""skip"" button. Overall, this is an excellent game worth a try. However, keep in mind that it will take more than a few minutes to get into it.",Sun Oct 04 18:54:16 EEST 2020,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103
62063908-73c4-43e1-9447-cf5830ff99b4,10,"Well, what to say about Star Trek Online... Steam says 1900 hours, but i bet its like 2200 already without the Steam Client. i played it from the beginning, not constantly , but now and then with friends. Is it old and feels a bit clunky? Yes. Could it use an overhaul? Yes. Is it good? Hell yes! Even with its outdated graphics and technology, this game is still somewhat addictive and fun, especially when you play it with friends. It is a free to play model, that is true. But most content (also endgame related content) is free and you can gain it via missions and work. The so called ""grind"" is something that you can do on a stand-by, since its literally getting some simple ressources (5 - 10 min work) and then clicking on ""earn reputation"" , and wait 20 hours to complete the task. That is literally all you have to do for ""endgame content"". No hours and hours of hard work with repetetive fighting and gathering. While the graphics isnt something everyone likes, this game gives you a very good executed story with hours of voice-overs, interesting missions and complete customization. You want your crew to wear a special uniform? Go for it! You want to customize your own skills, your crew skills and the weaponry of your character, your crew (away team) AND your ship? Go for it! You dont like Starfleet? You would rather play a deceptive Romulan with their cool ships, or a warmonger Klingon with a massive dreadnought? Go for it! This game has massive customization options, hundrets of ships, and an interesting take on ""Quests"". You hate being send to get some random drops like wolf-fangs or bear-claws with your task being slaughtering hundrets of monsters to finally get the drops to your npc? Well, Star Trek Online has NONE of such quests. Every single mission is literally a story, with you and your crew flying through the galaxy to distant planets and fighting huge battleships with torpedos, phasers and disruptors, but also holstering your guns and rifles and beaming down to get into dangerous close quarter combat in an enemy base to rescue hostages or find artefacts. True, they could have done the controls a bit better, but if you are able to literally adjust your controls and keymapping  to your liking, you will have alot of fun. I only say: ""Switch to shooter mode!"" , and turn your mmo in a third person shooter. If you are a Star Trek Nerd, you even can write your own log files. Oh, you have done all the story missions, and raids and fleet actions are nothing for you? How about you play one of the ten-thousands of missions of the foundry? Its a pool of community created missions that are mostly checked by the developers and being rated by players. Even there you have voice over. There is literally ""endless ingame content"" if you are searching for missions and quests en mass. And if you are a munchkin who likes to jingle a bit with numbers and calculations about the best gear, visit the Star Trek Online wiki and loose your mind about how much you can learn and do here. XDDont let yourself get tricked by ""only"" 3 classes... engineer, tactical or science. The class choice is literally only for selecting your base-abilities of ""you wanna do damage"" , ""you wanna heal or control"" or ""you wanna have a mixture of both"" . You can be a tactical player with grenades, supressing fire and damage buffs, while also flying a science ship or a cruiser. You are not bound by class, and you can literally choose your skills freely. All in all, i can promise that the game offers many options and gameplay mechanics that may be unusual for an mmo, but if you can overlook its age and the sometimes little technical problems, you will find a gem that can literally brighten up your day. Do some ships or species cost money? Yes, but honestly, this game has potential to entertain you far more than any actuall tripple A title with their usual 20 hours of storyplay, so you can honor the developers hard work with a few bucks to spend on this game. If i am generous with my calculation and even say a tripple A title would have 30 hours of entertainment in storyline, i would have had to buy 66 games to entertain me that long like Star Trek Online did. So yeah, have my 20 bucks for a nice endgame ship and let me play some more. ^^",Fri Jul 02 02:22:40 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

Design your own starships! You can even design the uniform! Come on!You can fly your ship through enemy space, brush up against cameos of your favorite characters, boldy go where noone has gone before, bounce the graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish, and explore strange new worlds to your heart's content!True, the game is dated, but the graphics are NOT bad for an 8 year old game. The character models are better than many games I've played and there's a decent amount of customization. I like playing really true-to-show experiences, but the ""make your own alien"" option was amazingly fun. Whether you want to make a race one could TOTALLY believe was in a Trek world somewhere, or create a hideous (or hilarious) abomination, the system is great fun. Worth fiddling with even if you won't play one, just to see what you can do with it.Seriously, the moment I stepped into the story and started flying my own ship around, I was living out my Trekkie fantasies of my own show with a captain just how I wanted her. I played a Trill after the nature of my favorite character ever (Jadzia Dax of course!) and the tutorial was barely over before I started reading the dialogue out loud and giving orders verbally, including whatever Trek-no-babble I could manage, just for the fun of it. Yes, I'm a giant geek, but I totally recommend you let yourself give into the urge to just ENJOY this game for what it does well: a wonderful story full of content that well and truly makes you feel like whatever character you chose to be.Play it for the story. Your own Star Trek story. Play this as a delightfully free story-driven action/adventure title and you will not be disappointed.Not-recommended if: You want to play it for other reasons than the story.

You just need to grind until your crotch is shiny and radiates tremendous amounts of heat.  While I can't recommend this to anyone who wants to have a life, I can say it's a pretty dang good MMORPG.

The story missions are pretty enjoyable compared to most MMO's, and make you feel involved in the plot rather than just as a witness to it. Also unlike other MMOs you aren't stuck doing gathering/kill quests to advance, but instead you are doing stuff to advance storylines. It was refreshing to play through an MMO that felt more like a proper story-based game.At times it feels like a strange fanfic of what happens next in the original universe, but it's still Star Trek. Sure the DS9 and Voyager continuations can make little sense, but it's still a fun time to see those characters return.If you're a Star Trek fan there is more than enough in here to delight you for a good long while.",Mon May 10 12:43:14 EEST 2021,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

I didn't find that the loss of the sandbox navigation of the first game detracts from gameplay at all, which I've heard was a common complaint; personally, I felt it made things easier because Crysis 1 always had me wondering if I was going in the right direction.

I disliked the change to a silent protagonist and I was disappointed that the story wasn't continued as Nomad, which I think could have been accomplished. I also think that the story felt just a tad too silly with character reactions and revelations throughout the game.

Finally, I'm sad to say that using the stealth suit is still the most overpowered way to finish the entire game because enemies suddenly lose track of you when you stealth,  and I had multiple occasions where they would shoot straight at me and every bullet/shotgun pellet would pass straight around me.

556890f6-2e8a-48fb-8c97-aebdbc7b3c18,8," To boldly go where no series has gone before! Star Trek Online has come a long way from the 49.99 shelf price I picked it up at. From beaming down to that alien world of your favorite Star Trek episode, to fighting the Borg across the sector. Each piece culminates into a game anyone who enjoys Sci-fi can love. Trekkies of course get the opportunity to visit each of those scenes they loved most in Star Trek.The current iteration of Star Trek Online is quite simply put, 'Marvelous' and only getting better with the addition of the Delta Quadrant. PVE is the main focus, but PVP is possible in specified battle zones. Surprisingly, and a wonderful touch in my opinion—has been the growing addition of Voice Actors for a number of main quests, and most importantly, voice acting by actual Star Trek actors, come to replay their digital roles. Some of STO’s original voice acting flops, but they have gotten very good at putting the proper emotion behind their voice actor’s character. Each new addition is far better than the last. More than anything else, in this game…the story is perhaps the cherry on top. Wrapping the player into a universe that is similar, and yet so very different from the shows we used to watch. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction of any kind, just wants to kill things in space ships, or loves a good story. Oh, and of course if you are a trekkie, why aren’t you playing already? ",Fri Nov 29 02:34:57 EET 2019,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

556890f6-2e8a-48fb-8c97-aebdbc7b3c18,9,"[UPDATE 2017] - The new ArcGames Launcher is terrible =( also they have changed crafting yet again and made it more grind quest, they also added a new teir system for specialization of your character... not entirely sure if that is in addition to the old setup or if it completly replaces it. New ship teir upgrades seem to be just a way to get more money from people for getting them to pay for upgrading their ships to the new level cap... overall would say game is going down hill in terms of enjoyablity, but still there is a lot of content and story you can play for free... but you can and do play it all solo... so i guess the big question is, why is this called an MMO, other than chat and a great friendly community, there really isn't a lot (or any) multiplayer gaming involved...Love this game. Stays true to Star Trek style without getting to MMO gimmicky. For a long long time (years and years) there was no level cap increase, which I liked. It made it not about levels, there was just new expansion packs, missions, story and new epic ships, gear, and classes. Made it more about the gameplay and less about grinding.Pros: Giant emersive star trek universeRidiculous amout of missions and contentRPG style for both your main character, you bridge officers and your ship adds a nice changeSpace combat is awersome. dynamic fights and strategy plays a large part in success not just better gear. yet still simple enough and not to complicated like Wing Commander where on top of everything else you need to learn to fly. Cons:PVP is very limiting. there are two factions at war, but PVP feels like a trapped collaseum of bashing each other till another ship explodes, pvp matches are also limited to how many people can fight. Compared to other MMO RPGs with PVP where you are running around with 30 or 40 other people it feels less MM and more like a group of friends came over for board game night. Ground combat: ground missions add a great change to space missions for sure, and the unique skills, puzzles, and enemies types keeps things interesting. and while I have seen some people group for ground 'raids' to get crystals and gear, the game makes it less enjoyable to actually participate in ground combat and has no insentive for ground PVP so no one really does it.Crafting: crafting has changed a lot over the years in this game. the first version was cool cause it was very 'Star Trek' like with various types of crafting each with sub crafting types, very star trek specialization. I liked this for this reason, made me feel more apart of the star trek universe. However, and understandable so, it made being able to craft everything incredible difficult (if thats what you want, its not for me, but I know lots of MMO gamers who do) and required 100's of specific and different crafting materials. So they changed it. simplifed a bunch of it, and reduced mats, and got rid of the sub specities.... then I took a year off the game and came back,... and it was changed again... even more simplfied but also now completly useless. None of the craftable gear was anything you would ever want to use. The had changed the way the 'fleet' bases worked and all the gear that was worth 'crafting/buying' was now sold at your fleets starbase. (the rest of the gear worth getting became reputation gear from the borg/omega/romulan expansions).Last con: this game has changed owners so many times and each time different people try to do different things with it and it has changed the way the game is played.  Perpetual Entertainment started working on it for the first 4 years, i signed up with them to be notifed when the game was ready and for beta testing, When Cryptic Studios took over development after Perpetual went bankrupt and started their codebase from scratch, I was never informed and the list I signed up for on the website was never transfered over and it was kinda ridiculous when I found out I had to sign up again. Atari did a really good job of adding new missions to the game but when they no longer wanted to be in the MMO ring they sold the game (and other MMOs) to Perfect World Entertainment, who already owned a vast array of MMO games. Although PWE has done some really good things for STO (the last two expansions were great), they changed the in game currancy and micro cash transaction system to match their exisiting games that clearly make them money, and they baught STO to make them money so it makes sense but it also made STO less like a star trek MMO in a star trek universe and more like a very 'gamey' environment, where everything was setup to game you into buying things. Which completly changed the dynamic and how the game was played in a not so positive way (if you were enjoying the star trek universe anyway). Its still a great game, just feels more like a futuristic sci-fi game now and less like you are in the star trek universie. I list this as a con because who knows who will own it next or what they will do with it.",Sun Oct 03 11:24:21 EEST 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

ea7fbf92-5c96-4b18-810a-419ed570b18e,10,"This game has come a long, long way since I began playing about 3-4 years ago. Back then it was like a hollow shell, filled with boring things to do, not many cool things and mostly it was just kind of bland. Now, however, they've totally revamped the game it's no longer what it used to be. It's fun, engaging, exciting and for us Trekkies (LLAP!   \\//,) it's become the game we all wanted it to be. I highly recommend it for any Sci-fi fan, Trekkie, MMORPG'er or mixed FPS/3rd Person style gamer, it doesnt play like any other game I've played. It has an incredibly versatile battle system for fighting in space and on the ground. They've bulked it up with exsquisitely created fan mods which are stories you can playthrough...basically player created DLC. They've added all kinds of new types of missions: diplomatic, space missions, research missions, ground missions of all sorts, away team missions and lots of sweet new gear to boot. The characters themselves look the best they've ever looked; when I first began playing I was very disappointed in the way they looked, they were all sort of the same looking. Now, the characters have tight gear and outfits that are totally unique (assuming you have some epic stuff to equip and in some cases, even if you don't!).                               As you continue to level up, you just look cooler and cooler. The ships are sick as well and since you can choose 3 separate factions (Klingon, Romulan, Fedreration) then you have a choice of some sweet Romulan ships (which are all epic thanks to their singularity warp drive ftw) or if you want a cool Klingon Bird-of-Prey or a classic (or newer!) Federation ship (also, any race can play any faction). The weapons have become more and more epic over the years just like everything else in STO. 100% Worth a shot, if you've been uncertain about whether or not to go for it, now would be the time.

ea7fbf92-5c96-4b18-810a-419ed570b18e,6,"I joined this game only after it transition to the Free-to-play model and am basing this review off of that experience, and is a well above average concept for a free-to-play MMO. With a high production value, quite remarkable music score and high quality dialogue for what little dialogue there is the game feels quite polished to date. For the Starship junkie such as myself, the ships look detailed and true to canon. The main quest is gripping and enjoyable, it makes levelling a breeze with a good balance of investment and reward as your character levels.In contrast to other free-to-play MMO’s, the micro-transactions in this game are kept to a minimum; most purchases made from the Cash shop are entirely cosmetic, which have little to no impact on game-play, and are not necessary in the progression of your character. In addition to that, the in-game currency Dilithium can be converted to large sums of cash shop credit, offering economical alternatives for those that don’t wish to outlay any cash, but spend vast amounts of time playing.Space combat is one of its strengths, you will have direct control over your ship and its stations with everything laid-out in front of you. Basic Starship operation and commands are very intuitive with control tight and concise. Yet, ground combat is another story. On the ground, your skills are vastly different from that in space, how effective your combat will be will be dependent on the your chosen away team, with the focus on movement, your equipment and environmental hazards, as well as the groups of varying enemies. Coupled with the rather basic RPG style of button mashing to complete your attach, ground missions will wear out their welcome sooner rather than later.Space exploration itself is somewhat of a disappointment, for an open-world title, the experience you’ll have amongst the different sectors and its planets are at best, predictable and simple. Most missions comprise of destroying ships or scanning structures. While the strong story arc helps break the monotony and generally tie pieces together, most of the open-world encounters have little to no plot or reward for your time invested.In comparison to other MMO’s, the amount of content can be scarce, once you have reached your characters level cap and completed the official episodes you will have very little to do, especially if you’re the one to play solo. Playing with a friend or joining a guild will be highly recommended to break the monotony of grinding and the entertainment flowing. While all MMO’s have their fair share of grinding, the problem here is the lack of variety on what to grind at. For a free-to-play MMO, this game does stand-out amongst the rest. It’s well-polished, true to Star Trek lore and canon and an enjoyable experience within a group, and on the plus side, you get to be a Star Ship Captain. As a relatively high-quality product, it’s the community that will once again let it down. Every on-line game has its fair share of elitists and career orientated players that often need to stop and brush the Dorito crumbs from their neck-beards every once in a while and thankfully the community can be filtered out.",Sat Sep 26 18:37:48 EEST 2020,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6

ae40d56c-6e71-4446-83ff-1dc8a79fa9a0,7,"Right, I think I've played enough of this now, to be able to give a review and being an MMO its pretty simple review as well.*Though I did end up waffling on, oops. So read on for the full waffle otherwise...Pros' - Free, Trekkie, Story, Ground & Space combat.Cons - Pricey, Grindy.If you like MMO's, which in gerneral I don't, then you'll probably like this. Theres is plenty of busy work, as I call it, stuff to grind at to unlock better stuff and when you get to Level 50+ you unlock even more busy stuff to keep you busy for litterally hours as well as the usual events that these sort of things have, such as the recent Christmas event, which I joined into too late, so I ignored it.A big word of warning though, the game does a really poor job of explaining most of these mechanics and you'll be left asking the community questions alot.However I have been taking part, mostly, to the 7th Anniversary event that is currently on as of writing. Which again is very grindy and not really my thing but like I said if your into MMO's you'll probably love this, as its abit different to others that I've tried over the years, it has the 3rd person combat, that seems to be most MMo's style but also the space combat, which is also 3rd person, so basically the same combat mechanic really but it does vary it just enough to keep things aleast abit more interesting.However, if your not into MMO's but your either a Trekkie like myself or maybe a fan of RPG, then I would suggest giving this a go as well. As if your a Trekkie then, its a chance to be your 'own Captain', which four different gaming openings which do really good job of drawing you into the story of the universe on offer. However its got too be said that once you get past the opening intros, then it really just sidelines you into either the Federation of the Klingon paths and even them do have cross over stories with each other.But saying that, if your not a Trekkie but an RPG fan, then you probs still like this, as the stories aleast on the first time of playing through are interesting to keep you play.Like I said, I'm not a MMO fan but I am a Trekkie and a RPG fan, so I've been playing mostly just through the story, ignoring all the padding and I'll probs stop playing once I've finished the main game story, treat it just like an normal RPG in essence rather than MMO.And lets face it is free, so why not? However like most games of this time, the in game purchases are rather expensive. To buy a first Tier ship (the first class of ship you can unlock), its basically £5, with the second tier being a £10. And it keeps climbing to tier 6. So obviously I havent spent a penny on it, and at these prices I won't be either. If the ships cost say £1 each, regardless of tier then being a Trekkie I would be more tempted. As you unlock more ships after every 10 levels, luckly you are given a free ship every 10 levels as well, so as you upgraded to a stronger class of ship requirement, the game does let you keep pace without spending money but your selection for a free ship is at most a choice between three, so as a Trekkie your always saying, awww but I want that ship! But given the choice I'd rather spend the money of an actual physical model, so developers making it cheaper if you want my cash!",Wed Nov 24 00:38:19 EET 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

PU-LENTY of starship combat, which is why this is the primary i play. random starship combat means if i want to go fight, i fly there.  in the other races, i cannot enter the same combat area's, EXCEPT the main ""starbase que"" areas (one or 2 per sector), thereby reducing my starship time.klingon campaign is a bit more linear than feds, a bit more fun, but little extra ship combat.  the storyline is easier to follow than feds.  i havent found any missions that are downright annoying yet on the klingons. romulan campaign is linear, levels are pretty easy, but you have to finish one piece for the next piece. no random combat in space (yet atleast - very linear) (a bit of a bummer), but its nice and everything makes it feel like a good story.  i think this may be the easiest to go up, as i did so faster than klingons, and much faster than feds (who i think take the longest).overall i do like playing, but, i would prefer to not have feet touch the ground, and stay in my ship.fed starts w reliant, then you can choose from thereklingon starts w ship KINDA, i dont want to spoil it.romulan doesnt START with a ship, but you get one within a few levels.",Sun Oct 17 21:25:35 EEST 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

83dda648-d51d-4a8e-84a4-a8c0ac493e04,4,"I started playing in the middle of 2013. and did enjoy it till the recent launch of Delta Rising (DR). Before DR it was fun to get in and play the content, and grinding was not the only focus in the game. However, that has now changed.Don't get me wrong, going from level 1-50 is still as enjoyable as before. It is when you get to level 50 that you feel like you are punished for doing so. The DR expansion gave us a new level cap of 60. However, there is not enough mission content to help you level up.They want us to now repeatedly run patrol missions for stupid amount of times just for one level. This is to keep players in the game longer, instead of offering content to keep players in the game longer, like before.Everything is being monetized. They are revamping things in the game, just to try to monetize it. The crafting system, and now the Bridge Officer (BOFF) system. Also, they created an upgrade system that they are using to monetize on by asking outrageous amounts of Dilithium for them also.Just to clearify, Dilithium is the most expensive resource in STO. It can be used to exchange for Zen (their game store to buy stuff in), or to buy gear that is usualy better quality weapons or gear than mission rewards, or loot drops. There is Dilithium ore, which is what you get for rewards, and Refined Dilithium, which is what you turn the Dilithium ore into. The major problem is that you can only refine 8,000 per day, per character.With the extreme amounts of Dilithium requirements in the game now, it is near impossible for a new player (casual or hard core) to reach a competitive state without paying out real money for Zen to convert into Dilithium. But, before the DR expansion, it was easy for a very casual player to reach a level where they were competetive in just a few months.Instead of fixing isues with the game being unbalanced, they sell power creep. A lot of bugs go unfixed, and many have been in the game since before I started playing.When I first started playing, I would have, and did recommend it to other people. I was able to see the potential the game had. Yet, over the years it has turned into a game that focused on punishing grind after grind to replace actual content. And there is so much grind in the game that it strongly encourages players to spend money to get the new power creep, so you can do it just a little bit faster.The game is now in a sad state. The main developer that oversees the game even admited that he doesn't care what players (their customers) say, and has repeatedly insulted players, and even accused them of exploiting the game, when it was being played as it was designed by them.I would not recommend Star Trek Online till it is no longer about nothing but money, money, money. When the game is turned back into an actual game, then I will start recommending it again. Though, till new management is brought in, or the management they now have will stop focusing on money, and make the game fun, I can't see that happening.",Wed Dec 15 22:23:54 EET 2021,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103

To get marks you'll need to either fight in instanced battles (space or ground) or in open world maps (also space or ground).In my opinion Star Trek Online is best played in doses.

It took nearly two years for me to get Grand Theft Auto V, I've only recently gotten Left 4 Dead 2, and I'm still trying to convince myself to get Spore. But after years of playing in the online virtual world ""Second Life"".. and having a lot of fun hanging out with Star Trek roleplayers in SL.. when this game was announced, well.. I went a little crazy.I pre-ordered a lifetime subscription. During beta. I can only speak to the game's features as a ""gold"" member.. but what I can say is that this game is pretty epic.. for what it's trying to be.I had very limited experience with MMO type games prior to STO. I've since learned that some of the 'failings' of my initial reactions to STO were just indemic to the whole MMO drama (flawed animations, no lip syncing to spoken cutscenes, combat that was rudimentary in some areas, or overly power based, etc).Once I got USED to what MMO's are like, I returned to STO, and to be honest, I really do love this game. The graphics are gorgeous, the ship and costume customization options are pretty amazing, and once I got used to all the various powers and systems and things, it can actually be a lot of fun. The story lines can be a little cheesy in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.. there's often a little sarcastic comedy thrown in that keeps doing throwbacks to the various series.The graphics for this game are what amaze me most tho. Every single screenshot I take, looks like something off the cover of a Star Trek novel. Whether it's a space shot, or a picture on an alien planet, walking around starfleet academy, or whatever. It is truly a lovely game.Honestly, if you love Star Trek, and you like MMO's, this game will probably be a great fit for you.And hey, it's free to play. Give it a try.

There is research to do with your officers, setting skill points for yourself and your officers as well as promoting them. There are joint effort missions like Borg invsions to beat. You have away missions on both ships and planets. You can explore the inside of your ship real time and interact with all department heads in each area plus your bridge crew. All ships are fully customizable from interiors to exterior colors. You get a free ship choice on each Rank level you make. All in all I am saying a good game and you really can accomplish a lot with the total free play. But I have to admit there are a few aspects that you might want to put a dime or two into it like for the lock box keys and increaseing your inventory size because you can loose some stuff once it is full and you forget to sell what you do not want. You can play dobble, drink at bars, interact with people on planets and many star systems to explore. And missions are easy to find and get tossed at you often. All I can say is try it out for free see how you like it and then go from there.",Thu Oct 07 07:50:16 EEST 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

Two years ago the game used to be simple and smart, the combat mechanics were easy to learn and you could become a master in several ways. Spending real money wasn't necessary if you were playing at least once per day.Then, this perfection started to slowly fade: they released lock-boxes (another pay to win way to obtain the best ships), significantly increased the costs of equipment, introduced tons of bugs (some fixed, but not all) and released new P2W stuff like rain. Moreover, they completely ruined PvP (actually, Devs never cared about PvP, now is unplayable) and, above all, made Engineers and Scientists useless, or at least much lower than Tacticians, since the only thing that currently matters is DPS.I'm Leader of a good Federation fleet, 100% Free To Play (yes, I haven't spent money for it yet, but it's extremely hard) and currently a better player than 99,999% of the community. I keep playing this game because I became friend with other players and this is the only Star Trek MMORPG existing, but at its current status I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone.Hope my review will discourage you from installing this game, trust me, there are better games around.",Sat Dec 25 18:19:59 EET 2021,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

It has amazing graphics and physics (In Black Ops the only thing you could do that involves physics is shoot a bottle from the table. You can't even compare that to this amazing game). You have so many different ways to fight your enemy (or even sneak past them all together in stealth mode) and the AI is very smart aswell. The Multiplayer is way better than the one of Black Ops in my opinion since it simply has the nanosuit. You have to take care of multiple things at once. Your nanosuit's energy, the people you are facing and the objective you have to execute. My favourite gamemode would be ""Assault"" it's basicly like Call of Duty's Search and Destroy (round based) but with hacking terminals.

8a2e47b3-73a1-4048-85e1-17abdeed5614,6,"  Star Trek Online is an oddity among games. While most that have bad releases generally die off after a short period of time, not only has Star Trek Online survived for years, its become a wildly successful MMORPG... and for very good reason. Of all the Star Trek being produced right now, this game risks to cover a period of time that nobody else seems to want to touch anymore: The Future, several decades after the events of Star Trek Nemesis and Deep Space Nine.  I am a massive Star Trek fan. This has made a lot of the single-player games to be very lack-luster to me since most of them force you into a specific role and generally its one of an action hero, something that is contrary to what Star Trek was supposed to be. Other then the adventure games like 'A Final Unity', '25th Anniversary' and 'Judgement Rites', most Star Trek games completely miss the spirit of the show. This game, while having a definite focus on combat, breaks up the fighting with numerous other mini-games, tasks, and puzzles. You can send out crew on away missions, once you hit higher levels and become an Admiral you can send out ships you originally commanded on missions, you can go mining for dilithium, pick up daily missions, work on your reputation with different factions, patrol worlds that aren't even part of a quest, or even play content created by other players and deemed good enough to be placed in-game. If I were to compare this to AAA titles like World of WarCraft I would have to give it and advantage in the sheer number of things you can do to keep the game feeling fun.  Gameplay works very well, especially in space. The ships handle like they should, the weapons are exactly the way they should be, and the powers all seem like they have a place. The graphics are very high-end but can be edited around so you can run the game on lower-tier systems.  I would be amiss if I didn't mention the best part of this game, and that is customization. Hair, facial structure, species, body proportions are all fully customizable, especially if you choose to make a custom alien species! Uniforms are available from every single era of Star Trek including the future uniforms and alternate universe uniforms if you want to spend a couple bucks. You are able to command every single starship made popular by the Star Trek series, from the original Enterprise to the USS Defiant. Some special ships are available as well which only appeared in a single episode like the Prometheus-Class, or the Dauntless. Variations on ships are available as well like the Saratoga version of the Miranda-Class seen in the first episode of Deep Space Nine. A painstaking amount of effort was made to allow players to utilize any ship they wanted, even having ways of using a Constitution Class in the end-game. Of course, when you see the ships designed by the STO team as Starfleets newest vessels you may not want to bother with the original ships since the new designs are exemplary. Most of these ships act as updated versions of earlier ships like the Resolute-Class being a modern overhaul of the Excelsior-Class. There are a few which are completely unique and its obvious the team loves Star Trek because they are faithful to Star Trek while still looking suitably advanced.   Ship Equipment is another way you can customize this game. Their are numerous weapon styles based on the ones seen in the series. Phasers, Disruptors, Plasma, Tetryon, and many more different forms of weaponry all pertaining to even the more obscure species, plus combinations of these different types and special weapons you find along the way, like the Klingon ""Hargh'peng"" Doomsday Weapon killing torpedo. Almost every part of your ship can be upgraded and enhanced, sometimes with interesting visual effects on the ship which can be turned on or off.  I mentioned the crew before but a quick blurb on them is appropriate since they are also completely customizable. You may not get what you want at the start but over time of finding bridge officers and customizing them you eventually will have a ship full of characters you designed yourself, in the positions you want them in.  If my massive gush-fest wasn't enough to say so: In this game, if you cannot find a combination of uniform/ship/crew that makes you happy, you either aren't looking hard enough or you aren't really interested in Star Trek.  The sound is all spot on and its fun to play a captain from the 'Original Series' era because a lot of the effects and sounds are replaced to reflect the more classic style. Much effort has been made to make sure the immersion is perfect, with little touches like the Klingons, Federation, and Romulans having different transport effects. Overall, the attention to detail is impressive and helps make the whole game feel polished. It doesn't hurt that they keep pulling in cast members from the series to voice act their characters in-game. Characters like Geordi La Forge, Worf, the Doctor, Seven of Nine, and numerous others all make an appearance, reprised by their respective actors. It all helps make the game feel that much more authentic.  ON THE OTHER HAND!   Star Trek Online's theme song is suitably heroic and sounds sufficiently 'Star Trek' but the few other songs in the game tend to repeat, making it a little annoying after a while of hearing the same song from Vulcan playing while you are fighting Borg on a damaged Cube. So the music is a low point in this game.   Additionally there are still some graphical glitches that come up, and the ground combat is generally annoying. It is still a sight better then when the game first came out but its like upgrading from a Shark latched onto your leg to a Piranha latched onto your butt. One isn't quite as bad as the other but its still not very pleasent.  There are micro-transactions which can be used to purchase additional ships, appearances, crew members, officers, etc. If you don't mind a little hard work you can get the micro-transaction currency through the in-game resource 'Dilithium'. Not that you really need to buy additional customization because there is already so many options its mind-boggling. While I am not too worried about the transactions I know many people don't like them. Pricing can be pretty varried. This may have something to do with the Dilithium system and the team not wanting to make it easy to get entire ships through in-game grinding, but it can be annoying at times. Entire costume packs consisting of numerous extra appearance options can cost a very reasonable $5.50 USD, but a top-tier ship (T6) generally costs $30.00 USD which can get really pricy. Thankfully once you get one T6 ship you generally are set to go on ships for the forseeable future, you just have to start with upgrading the ship equipment.  In conclusion, it's a fantastic MMORPG that keeps getting updates and keeps getting better. If you are a Star Trek fan and want to command your own ship there is no reason to not play this at least a bit.",Sun Nov 21 01:46:28 EET 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

It's nothing more than a cash-grabbing MMO which is feeding off of Trek fans that have no other game to play. These people will say you don't need to spend money but you do when you get to end game. End game is nothing more than grinding a lame rep.system until a new episode comes out. And with every expansion comes a new rep.system to grind. Now CBS is forcing them to add Discovery content to help push this new Trek show which is a failure. This is what you have to look forward to in the game.

Servicable, but poor. Controls during space battles/events are even worse though, and that's where this game is suppose to shine. The story is rather bland. Then there's the immersion breaking stuff you encounter if you actually enter your ship. Things like the interior of a klingon bird of pray having halls large enough to build the parthanon in. The clunky UI doesn't help much either. There's a very good reason the game went from pay to play to free to play as fast as it did. This just isn't a good game.",Mon Jan 03 13:21:14 EET 2022,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

f7bddf97-a0ae-4df6-89ff-a45f895b4129,2,"Bland and uninteresting. I'd like to start by saying I absolutely love Star Trek, the very premise of the franchise, I love everything about it. I downloaded this game (after ages of being put off of it's 10GB installer, which is a valid reason I feel with terrible download speeds) and my word, I could not be more disapointed. I had hoped for another Bridge Commander with a few ""Mass Effect-equse"" battles. In reality, the ground combat is just awful, essentially pre Mass Efffect 1 combat, and we all know how bad that is. The space combat is similar to Bridge Commander, but nowhere near as fluid. The quests are literally pointless and only serve as a use to tell you to get around the very vast galaxy. The first few minutes are just laughable, the plot is completely unrealistic, even in a Sci-fi world. Sadly, the point I wanted to get to, PVP, with massive PEW PEW PEW space battles, wasn't obtainable. As you have to be a certain level to even have a hope of joining a lobby and then being able to actually survive the Pay-2-Win. Why on Earth they didn't just remake Bridge Commander I have no idea. That right there is a gold mine. After 6 hours of play, I could take no more and freed up some space on my HDD. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it just feels so outdated and unnatural to play. Hopefully they'll be a nice new Star Trek game out in the future.",Wed Jul 15 14:02:19 EEST 2020,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6

To put it simply, the netcode is absolute trash.  Minor connection hiccups that cause 1-2 second lag spikes in other games will cause this game to immediately drop its connection and force you back to the login screen, and often it will take several minutes and multiple attempts to reconnect.  Unless you have a top-tier, highly reliable internet connection, STO is simply unplayable outside of very limited off-peak hours.  If you have fantastically reliable internet, go ahead and give STO a try.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.

Infact so much its not only unworthy of carrying the name Star Trek But Its got way to many issues that need desperate fixing.First off anyone thats getting connection issues. I agree That means Connection issues with some of the servers like the account server need to be resolved.Secondly Any maintanence ect. Shard maintanence being done needs more clear posting and further more Why do such a thing with the server up. Take the server down if your gonna do Maitanence damnit.And finaly whoever says this game needs a new Engine. They are right This game is in desperate need of a new engine and badly.Bottom line Cryptic you have let me down and a few other users down with your handling of this game you damn basterds.,Sun May 24 08:23:10 EEST 2020,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

After getting the game I was surprised how bad it was. Space combat was super tedious and slow, quests were all the same and everything was confined to small areas. How am I supposed to boldly go where no man has gone before when I'm confined to a small area like its an instance? If you've ever played the DnD MMO then you will know what I mean. It was the first MMO that I didn't play out the free month. They would have had to change pretty much the entire game for it to be good. By all means get the game and play it, but do so before you shell out a dime of your money.",Tue Dec 21 13:47:16 EET 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051
dc67bec1-5704-4112-836f-9ed374554a72,8,"Despite the Cryptic Engine not being the most innovative graphics engine out there, the game has some of the most fun space combat I have tried out of the non ""FPS"" types.Cryptic keeps pushing out content patches, new ships, and the class costumisation is one of the most in-depth I have ever found in any game. It's heaven for theorycrafters. Every so often however, Cryptic might release a new skill or item that makes one type of build the flavour of the month and in one case it can shadow all other builds, which are left in the dust.That's always the risk in a game where every class can access virtually every skill.The game merges two types of gameplays, the ground combat and the space combat. They work and feel different and you are able to concentrate only on one if you don't like the other. While levelling you might need to do a little bit of both, so depending on your tastes it might be either welcome variety or a minor annoyance, until you get to end game and are completely able to pick what kind of content you want to play.The ability to walk around your ship and starbases also allows plenty of opportunities for RP if you are into that. Talking of which the character costumisation in this game is on par with games such as Aion, if not better. The graphic style is not Asian, but when you can pick things like the length of your fingers, you know you can do almost anything.The game isn't necessarily pay to win, although items from the Zen store do have their advantages. If you have the time to grind, you can exchange in game currency for Zen (which you can buy with real cash) but the process is considerably slower.Overall Star Trek Online is an underrated game which has kept me busy for way more hours than most other MMOs I have played. In fact only one other MMO managed to beat it.",Wed Dec 22 22:06:24 EET 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024
dc67bec1-5704-4112-836f-9ed374554a72,4,"Although the game is enjoyable, one first has to surpass a host of technical challenges and issues - most of which plague users after the game is installed. These include gameclient.exe errors, random crashes to desktop (without a report feature), crashes to desktop (which do trigger the report feature), disconnects, and memory leaks.In the 36 hours preceding this review, my client crashed out 23 times on an Asus 673JH-A1 with up-to-date drivers, making STO one of the buggiest games I've ever encountered. (This also takes the prize from Trion's ""Defiance,"" which gained quick post-launch notoriety for its bugs, glitches, and other game-breaking features.)Company technical support, or lack thereof, complicates the picture. Cryptic is known by this point as ""Chronic"" due to their persistent inability to launch a major patch without breaking at least one major feature - leading to at least 2-5 subsequent patches to fix whatever was originally broken. Technical support is also nonexistent, meaning you're on your own for troubleshooting and support.In short, definitely would not recommend this game.Update: After not playing the game for about 4 months, I reinstalled it on a whim and was promptly met by 3 crashes in an hour. At this point I'm giving up. No game is worth this level of aggravation.",Wed Nov 17 08:45:13 EET 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a
89940eb9-832a-4f1f-ac67-e9fdfd1e84e7,6,"I have always loved Star Trek; and as such, that will tend to make my review biased. However, I think it is fair to say that I will lay down what I feel about this game in a rather fair form. For the longest time, there have not been many great attempts at recreating the Star Trek universe in a game. Some of the best Star Trek games I would argue; go back to the late 1990's and early 2000's; where Star Trek Armada, Klingon Academy, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force and Bridge Commander were some of the best titles. Later down the road; such as the mid to late 2000's, you had some titles but none were particularly worth playing. Star Trek Online comes around, and yes: The launch was dissapointing for many who expected it to be a in-depth Bridge Commander style game; not to mention other details seem to have went missing from the game. This is partially due to the collapse of Perpetual Entertainment and the acquisition and development over to Cryptic. The game originally was a monthly fee based game; but eventually it turned Free to Play. I played it for a while years ago but have since been convinced to pick it up and see how it is.I have to say, I am quite impressed with it. The game overall makes you feel like you are in charge of a ship and you even go under the sensation of living in the shoes of a captain; the amount of things to do and the quality of the mission narratives makes the game rather interesting and not so much a typical boring MMO. Pros:1. Free to Play system is fair. (There is purchase content, but it doesn't upset balance.)2. Customization galore. (Ships, uniforms, officers, loadouts, etc. Lots of cosmetic choices.)3. Solo friendly environment. (You don't need to be with others to succeed. You can team up; but the game doesn't require it.)4. Large Officer roster. (Bridge officers that can operate your ship's systems. Assign teams to go away on missions outside your ship.) 5. Space combat mechanics. (Want to focus shield energy on a given side? Want to increase power to weapons? You are in control.)6. Not a grindfest game. (Want to hit the level cap? This game doesn't make you spend countless hours of your life to get to that point.)7. Foundry missions. (User generated missions that have their own plot and objectives. They can vary in quality; but it is player freedom.)8. Star Trek MMO. (Star Trek fans like this. This is totally not obvious, right?)9. Mission types. (Not every mission involves combat or fighting, some are simple scan or repair missions.)10. Mission narrative. (Some missions make you think of yourself fulfilling the role in a Star Trek episode.)Cons:1. Player community. (It is a free to play game, so this is sort of expected. Players get too political sometimes and often immature. Sometimes it is difficult to make inquiries in chat, etc. Not everyone likes this kind of environment.)2. Enemy bosses. (This is more of a annoying trope than a real problem. Enemy bosses such as the ""villain"" type always seem to escape you.)3. Linear missions. (There are plenty of them that offer different solutions to a problem; but many missions don't have multiple outcomes.)4. Away team issues. (The away teams that you bring into combat will never try to revive you unless they are not fighting. Sometimes Away team members don't maintain unit coherency.)5. Some visuals. (Some planet textures on even the highest settings still look blocky and ugly.)6. Customer service. (The customer service is known to be on the poor side. Lack of sincerity and cooperation when issues arise in cases.)Overall, this MMO is definitely worth playing; even if you are not into Star Trek; the game itself is quite entertaining and full of things to do. There is a lot of purchase content; but it isn't required to actually succeed in playing and enjoying the game.",Fri Nov 26 02:12:16 EET 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef
89940eb9-832a-4f1f-ac67-e9fdfd1e84e7,7,"Alright. Not going to lie...I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to Star Trek.  This MMO continues to surprise me. Namely, I started playing it when it first launched (and it was a subscription based MMO). Cryptic did a good job, but to be honest, they launched it too early, and it felt like it was halfway done.  The Federation side had a good amount of content, but the Klingon faction, did not.  So after playing it for about a year, I took a break from it (a year plus break).  Coming back to it after so long, even after it went F2P and Cryptic was bought by Perfect World Entertainment, I must say, Cryptic has done an excellent job in expanding the universe.  Not only did they launch a third faction, the Romulans, they also fully fleshed out the Klingon faction.  They also updated the trait system, kit system, and R&D system, while continuing to create Featured Episodes.  That, along with a more robust Foundry (a system that let's the community create playable missions to share), I must say, I've gotten hooked on this game once again.",Wed Dec 01 15:01:05 EET 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

Better duty officers provide special bonuses that improve your space or ground game by slotting them)  a newly revamped character trait system with meaningful and very well balanced traits to give to your captain that make very noticible changes in their abilities or give them whole new abilities!

89940eb9-832a-4f1f-ac67-e9fdfd1e84e7,2,"(While the review shows ive only played .8 hours of this game through steam i own a hard copy of the game i use to install so its not listed on steam. And i have played since closed beta.)Overall quality of this game is bad. Ive been with this game since its beta and it was shipped unfinished to meet a contract deadline, they (the devs) admited this. Major problems from the beta are still present in the game now years later. devs barely update the game at all and when they do it normaly breaks it worse for a few months then it goes back to what it was before with like one spelling error fixed in one converation nobody reads anyway. The games ingame store makes the game pay to win, but all that money you are paying them they are not putting towards developing the game.  Feature episodes (their version of a tv show episode) which are kinda like mini events that move forwards the timel ine of the game and cost alot of dev time can most of the time out of a 6 weeks for 6 parts series be completed in 30 minutesabout 5 min for a part some of the parts are purely walls of text to read and complete in less then 2 min.Actual gameplay of this game is in a word repetative. Go here kill this. Go here collect this. Go here kill this to collect this. Completely missing the point of the story telling that was any of the TV shows, starfleet rarely uses lethal force or force at all to achieve there goals but thats all you do in this game. Once in a blue moon you come across an interesting quest line but most are sub par, literaly narrow hallways with the entrance on one end, 4 groups of enemies to kill and a conversation at the end. Time to max level in this game taeks about 4 to 6 weeks. Ground combat in this game is a joke it lacks anything to make it fun, boreing interiors for all but 6 missions. Space combat is not in much better shape but at least they spent time here usualy interesting looking locations but still repetative combat, enter mission - kill 4 groups - conversation - leave.Dev comepletely fail at understanding how to make a game. There are enemies in the game that have a 0% chance to miss you and deal 10 times your health and sheilds combined both in ground and space. This is to add ""challenge"" to the game when in reality they skimped out on making the game made it kill you so you would have to eather try again and hope you DPS it to death before it can react or you grind some repetative mission to crap xp to become higher level then the guy to go back through the whole mission again to kill him and continue the sub par story that you dont even remember why your in the same exact looking base killing another dude.While most of this game is complete crap they have at least done some interesting things to the cannon star trek story line and is at least worth playing for a month to get the story if your a star trek fan. And some of there latest content that last big update adding the delta quadrant is rather good story and gameplay wise they actualy broke there own molds for missions in this last update, the main enemy in these missions is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fight in space since it can one shot even the most tanky crusier you have with a massive nearly unavoidable AOE in space, but other then that its rather good. Also while this game is lacking in most areas it is a fun game to paly with friends. Also making your character in this game uses one of the best systems ive ever seen in a game you can control almost all aspects of your characters looks. The create your own missions portion of the game called the foundry is also an interesting idea and fun to do some times. More often then not the community comes up with better missions then the devs do.I do not recomment this game for anyone at this time, maybe in a few years it might be worth recommending to people but not at this time.",Tue Oct 12 03:34:28 EEST 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

It's fun to go through the levels and occasionally nab a new ship here and there, though I will say it's been quite a while since I played it. I never got much into the clans and everything, but I really enjoyed the ship combat and felt like it was a lot of fun. Fighting on the ground was alright as far as I remember and building up your crew was a pretty cool aspect as well. I'd say it's a fun game whether you're into star trek or not.

e708c057-8a45-4703-a121-66a2b0118f47,4,"First thing i want to add is, don't be fooled by my playtime, i actually have more than 5.000h of playtime in this, but steam for some reason refuses to count playtime for me except rarely.This would be an even more gigantic review if i touched everything that is wrong with the game, but i'll just stick with the issues that were added with the current expansion and are obviously driving people away from the game, and it will still be a long review, so be warned.This game used to be one the most casual, if not the most casual F2P MMO out there, it was forgiving and extremely fun, all this changed with the ""Delta Rising"" expansion, which turned the game into a grindfest, padded enemy HP to the point of hilarity and added forced countdowns in almost every new mission or queue in order to force you into taking a certain amount of time to complete stuff, it doesn't matter if you're extremely well geared or not, you'll have sit there and wait, and to boot on ""advanced content""(mid-tier content), they made ""optionals"" non-optional, if you fail them, mission failed, so if you're unlucky and some idiot in your team decides he wants to ruin it for everyone, he can do easily by shooting something he shouldn't or something like that, and this pretty much killed queued content which went from over 300-500 people playing at any time to around 20-30 at most, cryptic explicitly said they would keep advanced content as hard as the old elite(they promised it in fact), but they lied and increased the HP by 500%(later lowered to 400%, after months of complaining), meanwhile the new max gear tier will give you a 60% damage increase.They also nerfed exp gain across the board, and added ""specializations"" which in theory are supposed to be optional, but with the new ships(which use said specializations) and the fact they're incredibly good, it means you HAVE to get them, and they also take forever to get, since cryptic did everything in its power to make sure it does take a ridiculously long time(if you try to get them playing normally, you'll be lucky to get a single point in a week, which would take years of playtime to complete it all, and in 8 months they released a completely new one and expanded a previous one, and have clear intentions to release more, let that sink in for a bit).They also released a new tier of ships completely turning the previous end-game ships, obsolete(we're talking about $25 ships here), now before you say ""every RPG releases new stuff that makes old content obsolete"" remember this, STO isn't a regular MMO, your ship IS you, your player character only really matters on ground combat which isn't the focus of STO, on space all you get are ""captain"" abilities and some minor traits(think of them as minor passive buffs), most of your space abilities come from your officers and some consoles which can be equipped in ships. now some will tell you that the new tier doesn't actually makes the previous one obsolete since you can ""upgrade"" ships of the old final tier(some cryptic herself said), this is a lie for the following reasons(with one single exception):1 - The new tier still has another extra skill slot for your bridge officers(this is very important), the upgrade on the old ships doesn't give them a new slot.2 - The new ships have ""traits"", some of which are hilariously p2w, but the most obvious one is ""all hands on deck of the tactical version of the command battlecruisers(across all 3 factions) which to keep things short, allows you basically cut down your captain abilities cooldown by almost 50%, if you're a tactical captain(which are already the best type), you have 3 DAMAGE buffs, 1 targeted resistance debuff and another ability that gives you cooldown reduction on all your tactical abilities right down to their global cooldown(see where this is going?), just to give an example you'll be able to use your main captain ability(attack pattern alpha = +50% damage) every 45 secs , instead of every 1min and 30 seconds(it lasts 30 seconds...). You don't need to actually use the said ship to use the trait, all you need is to buy it, then ""level"" the ship(which is quite fast if go somewhere where you can destroy many ships).3 - Every new ship can use one of the specializations(atm there are intelligence(incredibly strong), command and pilot), the old ones can't, and cryptic made it clear they never will be capable of using it, in other words if you're using old ships, you're locked out of new game content, isn't it amazing?Now for that exception, there is a ship called the scimitar, which is by far the best ship in the game due to the sheer amount of damage you can dish with it(which is kinda fair, since it was OP in the movies too), but make no mistake, cryptic has made it clear they intent on releasing every old iconic ship as a tier 6 version, so you can re-buy everything again(isn't it nice?), so its a matter of time till they re-release the scimitar.Cryptic also added ""crafting"" which is basically RNG-based gambling so you can get a weapon with the mods you wish, you also need to use it if you want take your weapon to highest tier, which is VERY costly, even more so if you're trying to get them to increase in rarity(unless you happen to be a bored billionaire from dubai or something, don't try to increase rarity, its stupid).So to summarize, cryptic took a game with a booming population, which had a very casual, forgiving and fun playstyle, and turned into a boring grindfest, outright lied to the playerbase, and refuse to fix it, even though the population continues to drop as a direct result of said changes. Cryptic has been trying desperately to reverse this by doing everything BUT reversing/improving on what they did, its not working and it will not work, because in the end, the game is still boring.My recommendation? stay the hell away from this thing, if you insist on playing this trainwreck, be a romulan tactical captain aligned with the klingons, get a scimitar and the 1000 zen nausicaan ship of the klingon side, it will give you the best console in the game, the plasmonic leech, you don't need anything else.I'll change this review if cryptic fixes those issues... which i seriously doubt will happen.",Mon Aug 09 04:44:37 EEST 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

I did enjoy doing a few  missions and recognizing them from old episodes of the orginal Star Trek series. It's definitely a game that the hardcore Star Trek fan could enjoy. The actual gameplay mechanics though are boring & clunky. I'm surprised I even played it for 11 hours. Normally with gameplay this terrible I would have instantly deleted it. But yes the fact that every mission will remind you of an episode of Star Trek that you watched as a kid, is what keeps you willing to put up with the poor controls and game physics. I understand it's free so I couldn't expect it to be a top tier game. But as a ST fan, I wish they had just made a quality game, and then I'd be happy to pay for it or do a subscription.",Sat Oct 17 15:37:12 EEST 2020,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

b055cdcf-d991-4f0f-9be5-810615390ccc,7,"The best way i can describe this game is like a mix of Farcry primal and sci-fi apocalypse. This game was incredible, Not only are the graphics some of the best ive seen but the music too! The sound and design team did an absolutely amazing job, yeah sure the running animation is a little funny but not unrealistic. And the characters in this game were great too, a lot of lore i did not care what so ever to read up on. But if you're into the history of digital worlds then this is a game for you too.

Pros
-Graphics on fleek 
-Great characters                                
-Voice actors are good
-Special dialouge for lots of areas
-Main character made me ZAMN

Cons
-Fighting system
(The fighting system with ranged weapons is just fine but the melee
  system requires some work. Theres no way block only dodge with roll)
-Too little quests i want more of this game ;((

Honestly just buy this game. The only flaw i ever found with it was really some animation jumps or melee fighting system being a bit janky. I rate this game a solid 9/10.

I decided to give it another go and was initially pleased that it was still easy to get into. However this has now turned into frustration with a constant stuttering I'm experiencing. I've checked and it doesnt look like its anything to do with my PC setup or my internet connection. On readin the forums it looks like quite a few people experience this and it hasn't been resolved. I would say to people to try but if you get the stuttering just give it up as it doesn't look like Cryptic are going to fix this any time soon.,Sat Jul 24 14:16:24 EEST 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

The crafting system is fun and also the Officer missions. You can send your crew to get recources for you or even different currencies you can spend for equipment. The stories are really cool and I can recommend the Missions which take you back in time to experience old star trek episodes. I recently joined again to see what changed. They implemented a lot of new features, quests and events so a PvE player might be very satisfied BUT if you are looking for PvP you should look elsewhere. The entire game changed from different fighting factions to a bunch of excel sheet reading damage maximizing grannys in pink pyjamas. They only maximize their gear to get better gear and to sit in their space stations dreaming of big fights which will never happen as nobody ever plays any PvP. So if you look for a complex game with seasonal events and story you are at the right place but you will never use your gear in player combat ever again.

After all, I never got that far because tech support was unable to answer a simple query concerning which domains to whitelist (other than perfectworld.com) in order to get it running on a secure system. Let's start from the beginning:.My system is specially set up so that JavaScript, etc.,  runs correctly on my system only when served from a whitelisted domain. From any other domain it gets shut down - which is how I know that STO is served, in part, from unspecified domains other than perfectworld.com and these other domains are, consequently, not whitelisted by my security. .What takes the cake is that, when I asked tech support for the domain names which needed to be whitelisted for the game to work, they responded by stating that the game works for “millions” of other people - which dodged the question by employing an argument by irrelevance; a form of sophistry known as a fallacy. I have to wonder if these guys even bothered to read the support ticket I lodged (given their total failure to comprehend the problem I raised) and why they couldn't simply address my question (as opposed to addressing some purely imaginary complaint).  .Now, when support techs start engaging in sophistry, it can mean that they are more interested in griefing the customers than doing their job. Moreover, this reflects very poorly on management, for obvious reasons; principally because it demonstrates the attitude that they can do no wrong and it is always someone-else's fault which, ultimately, gives rise to a fundamental disrespect for the customer base..The bottom line is that I recommend strongly against STO and, moreover, I will not be reviewing this game again until I see some sort of evidence that key management changes have been made which facilitate policy implementation designed to ensure that customers are not systematically marginalised for the apparent crime of asking for some technical support.",Tue May 11 12:59:02 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

What I'm talking about here is when the screen transitions from one scene into another it doesn't allow all of the entities to load before coming in from black. So you're frequently left watching strange pop-in with stuff. There are also numerous control-specific things that just feel... off... like clicking over and over to attack, instead of being able to just hold down the button, to give one example.

Quests also suffer from constant bugs one way or another, sometimes even progress stopping bugs.Graphics wise it's outdated, which is not entirely a bad thing, but is paired with terrible acting and direction in cinematics, giving it some below amateur feeling that you can't wash off.And last but not least, the user interface is more of a bother than a help. Things like huge symbols in minimap that simply wont let you see what you are suposed to see, to everything looking pretty much the same and thus making it harder to even understand them, or weird design choices like not giving a more direct approach to equiping kit abilities, having to realize on your own that you are suposed to try random keys until you get P and see a selection of avaliable skills.Basically, if you can skip this entirely you won't regret it, it doesn't get any better as you progress, it only gets worse.",Tue Nov 23 08:15:39 EET 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

Avoiding combat, alternate solutions to the tasks at hand, using technobabble to get out of a tough situation are not here - You rarely even get fetch quests for most of the storyline as the game reduces you to ""go there, kill everything"".And to add insult to injury, the post-scarcity world of Star Trek has seemingly been taken over by the Ferengi.

b3897752-35c4-4416-a341-70896b36c32a,2,"I play STO fairly causually.Let's start with the bad: The ground combat is dated, even by MMO standards. Movement can feel clunky. Animations are sort of stiff. Sometimes the lag monster can really bite you. Even though getting to max level isn't bad, the reputation grind can be. The store isn't the worst, but its obvious that if you want cool things, you are going to have to dish out $5 here, $10 there. Unfortunately, there are premium ships that come with modules that you can only get that way, so for PVP this translates to pay-to-win.The stuff I like: The space combat is fun and it does feel like to you captaining a ship. The 'dungeons' (STFs) are kind of neat and its cool how they made space combat bosses. It's also a solid MMO to play casually without any of the big spenders getting in your way. You won't feel left out by not paying for things in the game as the only content you will be locked out of are certain premium ships (and their special universal modules).I would recommend this is you like Star Trek and are looking for this sort of game.",Sat Feb 20 03:43:42 EET 2021,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103

ff636938-558a-42b3-bb9d-5be199d2f497,7,I came to this game back on the free to play launch.  I for the most part played nightly up until a year to two ago.  While the game is a great game one of the biggest down sides that caused me to stop playing the game is the constant grind to level up just so you can play the next story driven mission.  Sure it is easy to level up but it just gets old doing the same thing over and over again just to get to some new content.  The game when I came to it wasnt too bad but with the release of the fleet bases the game became a very huge dilithium sink which is now starting to level off some as dilithium values have dropped as majority of people have already finished their bases.I do recommend this game because you can put many hours in it but be warned you will have to do a grind to get to some stories as the story missions do not provide enough XP to level up from one story to the next.,Wed Aug 18 00:10:12 EEST 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

fc266547-91aa-4526-a61a-5acdd828a3b5,7,"-As of November 21st of 2015, this review is woefully outdated. Be aware-Actually one of the more decent MMOs I've played. Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",Fri Sep 24 10:06:47 EEST 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

There are also lots of references to all the series and movies e.g. Sisko's baseball in his office on DS9. It also ties up some loose ends and explains things that were unclear in the franchise e.g. the Temporal Cold War or the Iconians. Some might argue that it's ""pay to win"", but that isn't true, because you can get equipment that can hold up with premium items at events and also earn the premium currency in-game.

If you need any help, low level or not, you can always message me In-Game(If online), or send me a Friend Request through Steam, message me and I will get back to you ASAP.

46ddcaf0-ba4a-4695-bd65-ebfc11e10e90,5,"Space, the final frontier, isn't it...? No, the real frontier awaiting exploration is the vast array of choices you can make, from designing a ship & character, to changing your destined route through different verbiage or a vernacular of missions peering through an almost unveiled veneer of polished textures on older models.Now, to start the real review it goes without mentioning that the user interface is hectic and as a UI designer I would love to be part of the team that built it so I can fix foolish placement and bad design. Not being an option the next best route is the tutorial, which explains the nuances displayed by most of the engine, leaving your curiosity to work out the quirks without making the player feel dumb. One piece of the game that is certainly lacking though is the ship combat controls which can be hard to maneuver when there is more than one enemy, having to disengage and focus on fighting but move far enough away as not to be affected by the blast of a destroyed enemy vessel.I would like to see this game receive a new launcher, some improvements to its UI, and polished cut scenes made on the current version of the engine before it receives an overtly high score, but I feel it's deserving of something above the middle ground as not only does this game try to draw you in, holding you hostage in tense battles for hours at a time, but it also returns a nostalgic feeling, one I last felt on the launch of Old School Runescape and a feeling I long to continue experiencing as I delve full time fervently further into the fabric of ths formerly forecasted foothold, frequented by funny but frustrated friendly men seemingly of fraternity fraudulentity.

I'm not one that really does the whole grouping and playing with others online and I don't belong to a guild or anything but even playing it as a single-player game is fine. Every now and then I may join a group mission and take on the Borg or what have you but the choice of races (Federation, Klingon, and Romulan) and different starting stories are really well done.

If you are a fan of any of the television series' then there is something here for you as all are respresented: TOS,TNG,DS9,VOY,ENT and that is a good thing. The gameplay is darn good and it look nice at max settings but nothing to compete with AAA titles. The ground misisons are fun and the space battles are awesome. The misisons are set about like episodes from the television series and there seems to be so much to do and there is variation depending on your race.You can upgrade your ships and get better ships as well  as your equipment for ground based misisons. I think if the game had a little more polish on the UI and the graphics/animation department this could be in the running to be the best MMORPG out there but as it is F2P you really should give it a shot. Come on you know you want to captian your own star ship but will you do it for the Federation, Romulus, or for the glory of the Klingon Empire!",Tue Jul 02 07:11:15 EEST 2019,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

However, the company that runs it is beyond corrupt. It really sucks to see after playing this game for so long, having made friends, putting alot of effort in and paying more than your average Joe this game is pretty much dead.

While it is missing some essential characters such as Kirk or Spock, the impeccable voice acting and character emotion is amazing. Naturally, like all MMORPG's there is a lot of collecting x amount of y monster. But it doesn't feel overdone or underdone in this game. I'm not a Star Trek fan but I'm enjoying it! The combat is fluent and the dialogue is near-perfect.However, there are only two things wrong, small things, but non the less they are essential. The frist point being my character has no voice and for such a star studded audio presentation it deterierates into laughable situations where it's a very serious moment, everybody panicing and there's me, stood there, emotionless and voiceless.My second and final complaint it the ship. I hate controlling the ship, it just feels clunky and I can never get it to the right speed.But other than that it's a thoroughly enjoyable game (so far) and I'm looking forward to playing more of it.

d809fa7b-f41c-42e2-8fb7-42643b89a565,7,"STO has been my game of choice since participating in the closed beta. Though it suffered from a difficult start and bumps along the way, the game has continued to evolve and grow. The PvE aspect of the game has become expansive and can seem a bit overwhelming at times for new players. With so many systems integrated over the years from Duty officer missions and abilities, Reputations systems, countless gearsets/combinations, greatly improved crafting system finally in place, and of course the missions both official and player created, the game feels mostly complete and whole finally. Like any MMO it will continue to evolve and not always in a direction everyone will be happy with. That said the Development team generally gets it right. The free to play aspect is among the best I have encountered in all my thirty years as a gamer and the last ten or so with my encounters with free to play models. There are items a player would need to purchase for endgame such as ship upgrade tokens, fleet modules, and a removal of the energy credit cap. All items mentioned can be purchased with either cashy money or in game dillithium converted to game currency through the dillithium exchange. Now for the bad. The PvP is woefully lacking in improvement and attention since launch. While it can be entertaining the public qeues are so one sided and have been since a few months after launch. Abilities are often unblanaced to a fault. Often you are stuck with either the cookie cutter flavor of the month builds, abilites, Duty officer combinations. Even if you have a great build you can expect to lose unless you have a mostly coordinated team all geared and built to provide the DPS and support needed to win. I would not recommend PvP to any new player without first consulting with a PvP group in game sadly. As for the bad part of the PvE side, The Special task Force missions and Advanced Qeues have become a DPS race. You need to participate in advanced Qeues to get items needed for reputation gear. Often if you need reputation gear you are not in a position to contribute much to the team. another. Another issues is the complete lack of need for the Enginner and Science professions in game. In space missions and PvP they are vastly less valuable than a Tactical captain because they cannot produce the same kind of DPS. Having had thirty eight Max level characters before Delta Rising and Six after fully geared and tested to a minimum of 15k DPS and some to as high as 35k (Good but far from great measured by the Infected Space Advanced Standard) and often coordinating for PvP and having written a few of the build guides over the years I feel qualified to say this. It is just the nature of the game for now and may change with balancing as time goes on. On a final note for the PvE is a lack of attention to some bugs, though not game breaking, they can be irritating.All that said if you are still here I completely recommend this game. The good vastly outweighs the bad and I will continue to play so long as this is true. See you out there.",Wed May 26 04:05:58 EEST 2021,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6

21d2ed46-234c-482e-9508-c0dbdf93f350,6,"One of the things that has always bugged me about MMOs is the long distance running to turn in quests. First they send you on a stupid quest to exact some justice on some lame fool who did something bad (insert short mission story line here), and when you finally get the guy and retrieve the spoils of battle from his cold dead corpse you have to run for days back to the quest giver to turn the mission in. So, for over an hour of gameplay you actually only played the game for maybe 5 minutes.  Not the case with Star Trek Online.In this space faring MMO you are the captain of your ship. You get to go out and have adventures and all that of a regular MMO with the flare of Star Trek. Along the way you can meet some characters from the shows. All that is to be expected. What was surprising was they way can get your quests. Like most MMOs you can walk up to a quest-giver and talk to them and they will give you the quest. In Star Trek Online you have the option of Calling them from your ship and selecting the mission from the list of available missions. It's almost as if the creators knew that you'd be a long, long way out in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't want to continually run back to to them just to turn in a quest. It is Star Trek, after all, why not just put them up on the main screen, Number One, and we can get on with our mission?Overall the graphics are basic for what systems can pull these days, and the voice acting in ok. The gameplay is a MMO game so you quest a lot. If you are a fan of Star Trek like me then you can forgive the game a lot and play for fun. At the sweet price of free, you don't even really need to be a fan to try it and see if space adventuring is right for you. Just keep in mind, if you are looking for the next blockbuster MMO to scale the mountain and dares all to knock them off of it, you're looking in the wrong place.

If teamwork is your thing then join up with an established fleet or take the plunge yourself and create a fleet just for your friends. Fleet management is, I will warn you, a time consuming and stressful at times vocation but it can and does bring its' own rewards.So many dimenions to the economies of the various currencies out there to mention here but a shrewd investor can actually make Zen (PWE's in-game currency) from the dilithium market.Overall, I'd recommend this to my friends as you have the option of playing for free and if you like it, you can always spend a bit of pocket money on improvements or even a new ship.7.5/10",Tue Sep 07 19:28:12 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

f397c0ec-6999-4c1b-8f06-953dc6b5dcc1,7,"Star Trek Online, or STO, is a game set in the space age with giant ships, a whole selection of races (Not Racing) and a vast galaxy to explore! I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one. I am going to give this game a 8/10 as it has 100's of hours of gameplay, regular updates and a vast community; but let down by its small glitches.",Sun Jul 04 00:17:34 EEST 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

There is the slight issue however of once you hit a certian point it is very diffucult to progress.

From the creative story mode to the awesome end game STF missions, there is a little something for all Trek fans. Well except J.J. Trek fans as this game's story is a continuation of the ""Prime"" Star Trek universe, meaning the game takes place in same timeline as all the T.V. Shows and 10 of the movies. (The story takes place in 2409 about 30 years after Nemesis.) Federation, Klingons, and Romulans are the playable factions and while on the surface they play similar; there are more than enough differences to make each faction unique and make you want to try each one at least once.This game has microtransactions that include ships, uniforms, sevices, and extra characters but in all honesty; you can play the entire game and have a blast and never spend a penny. Also, it is possible through farming and grinding to purchase anything from the ingame store without spending real money. The entire game is available if you want to work for it and since the game is so much fun; it never really feels like work.All in all if you are a fan of Star Trek you should give this game a try. It's F2P so there is nothing to lose but everything to gain.

56146676-d3c6-4585-b004-1fe4ec19aa11,6,"Disclaimer: This review is pretty much spoiler free!

I went into this game not really expecting much. I watched one review and was like ""yeah whatever"". Granted at the moment I have a hard time finding fun in games. It takes me a lot of effort to even be excited and only a few games wake the ""child"" in me again. This one definitely did. Literally the first game I got 100% and one of the only games I was so hooked I played the story twice (only a handful of games have given me that experience in my life). Of course the game is not perfect but it does a really dang good job. I am glad this was a PC port because I'm kinda sad that exclusives exist, especially when they're so amazing. Also there are barely any glitches or bugs anymore so don't worry (it had a problem when it released to PC)

Pro's:
+ Map: is huge, magical and beautiful. Very diverse with different biomes that flow into each other perfectly. Weather changes, day/night cycle, natural wildlife creates a rich environment that feels natural. 
+ Story: keeps you interested. There are quite a lot of mysterys that cant really be guessed upfront but get explained through the story. Side Quests fill in further gaps and almost all Quests are more or less unique. It doesn't feel like an endless grind of repetitiveness. 
+ Protagonist: Strong female character that actually has a personality unlike this woke bs institutions like Hollywood are trying to push. She has her positives and negatives which make for a rich character. The game builds a very emotional attachment to her and the story itself I felt infatuated with finding out what's next.
+ In Game Characters: There are a handful of unique and prominent characters that you remember and make the story more tangible.
+ Weapons/Armour/Enemies: Without Spoilering too much there are a TON of enemies each having their own unique behaviour/moveset, stronger version of themselves that can be fought differently, abusing their weaknesses with your weapons. Actually at a certain size of enemy pretty much every encounter feels like a boss battle where you need to pull up a different strategy which I just love. There are quite a few weapons to choose from that make you in control on how you want to approach said enemy. Armour can also be modified specifically for a certain use (damage taker, stealth etc.)
+ Eye for detail: There are a lot of easter eggs and even just decoration of areas you wouldnt normally be able to reach. Some of them are included in quests, some can be found by exploring. 

Cons:
- Facial animations / Voices: They don't feel as natural when it's not focused on Aloy (protagonists). When you don't look closely it's barely noticeable but at times you really see most of the effort was put into Aloy. Which definitely makes sense.
- Some animations: Are a bit ... annoying? Sometimes the character won't grab onto a ledge or your character doesn't move fluently so it sometimes fucks up what you wanted to do.
- Passing through: Something that I despised that was an intended function was if you wanna pass through a group of robots they still started to attack or put you into fight mode. Would be cool if there was some way the game detected you're just passing through so you wont be noticed and can just continue. It was fun at first but if you wanna just enjoy the scenery and get from A to B it can get annoying real quick.

I'm sure I've forgotten some things but in the end I'm happy I got to experience this. I hope the next Horizon game will come to PC eventually as well and I hope they dont fuck it up like many big studios did with their follow up games recently as they were just too confident instead of trying to love their work and impress the players. I'd much rather pay 70 bucks for a game like this than COD which is the same shit every year (recently even with less features). Because this shows there was love behind it. Thought. Dedication. Not empty promises like Cyberpunk2077. 

Thank you Guerrilla Games for this masterpiece and I hope to see more amazing things in the future :)

If you are even a little bit of a trekkie, there is a great deal of fun to be had here.That said, like most MMOs, it gets samey rather fast. It takes longer than most, which is something I really have to give the developers a great deal of kudos for, but eventually, you're going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. Something that helps combat this is that it has the concept of user-created missions. You can actually get on a special account type and create missions for others to play. These range from the awesome to the ""meh"", and is another unique feature to STO.The fact that this is free to play, and the paid addons are reasonable, makes it definitely one of the better MMO's out there.

13823200-f9ee-4fb4-b97c-88cb42473799,1,"-As of November 21st of 2015, this review is woefully outdated. Be aware-Actually one of the more decent MMOs I've played. Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",Sun Dec 26 18:58:30 EET 2021,82e96171-f8f0-4072-930b-bb225fa902b6
13823200-f9ee-4fb4-b97c-88cb42473799,6,"If you are a Star Trek fan, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try... for free. It tends to lose itself in the background noise of every other MMO around. It does nothing really special, but it is fun to try to design your own ship and uniforms, and pick your own crew. The only real criticism of this game is the same that I have of every MMO: you are not unique. You have the same gear, access to the same missions, and are captain of a starship just like every other player. Areas around planets and space stations are clogged with dozens of starships, all captained by players. I feel this is evidence of a systemic assumption in MMO design, that players don't want to work for anything. I feel it would have been far more compelling if they required you to work up to being a captian with your own ship.From a technical standpoint, I have constant issues with the servers being down. I often get significant lag followed by the termination of my connection and (when I try to log back on) the server is down. This is not an occasional thing. Just about every time I sit down to play. I'm pretty positive this is not an issue on my end, as I don't encounter this problem anywhere else. As a result, I've not been able to play this game as much as I'd like.Over all, I think it has some value in the idea that you get to see a lot of cool Star Trek stuff.

I did put a significant amount of time into it after all. Disclaimer: it has also been sometime since I have played this, so the game may be much different now than I remember it being.",Sun May 16 23:15:47 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

22f5c9cb-aaea-43d5-a3d3-8373dc268afd,7,"My opinion? I would say about 7/10.First, as a Trek fan I enjoy that it continues the story of the Prime universe, and that there are tons of call backs, references, and even cameos.Now, when I started, I admittedly felt like the controls were a tad awkward, but once I got used to them. I've found that that's all I really needed: to get used to them.The space combat is highly reminicent of what's seen in the shows/movies, even including attacks/abilities that can be traced to commands given by the various captains across the generations.The ground combat/missions could be better, but I personally find them tolerable.The graphics are good, but not fantastic, and it tells a good story overall.Also, if you love the ability to customize virtually everything(no, that's not an exageration), you'll get a kick out of this game. You can customize your outfits, your ships(with some restrictions based ship's class/type etc), alter your bridge officers, and even create your own species.The crafting system is a bit tedious, and materials are hard to come by, but it's not horrible.Now, if I had to name my biggest issue with this game, its the same as most MMOs: the microtransactions. By using real money to by 'Zen'(100 Zen = $1), you can unlock a lot of stuff, but some of it is kinda petty and/or overpriced. For example if you want to get a new ship past level 50(that's appropriate to your level), you better be willing to pay out $25 PER SHIP. Granted,, there are other ways to secure new level appropriate ships, but most are geared for LV 50, and require grinding for special currencies to aquire.Also, I have to say I've notice the community tends to be a bit juvenile.  Even though there do appear to be some more mature people among the community, by and large I would recommend just soloing unless you really need help.So, overall the gameplay is enjoyable and good for Trek fans, plus it also has some good storytelling and decent graphics. But, the petty money stuff and largely immature community are a bit offputting. If you are a Trek fan, or just love MMOs with lots of customization and decent story, check it out, and enjoy some nostalgia.If you aren't a Trek fan, can't stand stupid players, or hate microtransactions...feel free to give it a try, but it may not be for you.",Tue Feb 16 04:02:02 EET 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

That way, escorts would actually make use of their mobility)Several story arcs could use a major overhaul, the Cardassian arc and the Breen arc for example.Space flight could also use some tweaks.

The story is top notch, world is beautiful, enemies are interesting, mechanically it's pretty good.  The devs really let their imaginations out of the cage with this game.  The fact that it's grounded in the real world made the story and landscapes just connected enough to IRL to be cool.

A couple things in particular started to sour my experience toward the end, though.  The open world here is not like Skyrim where you could potentially wander for hours and only run into a couple wolves and a bear unless you entered a POI.  There are enemies absolutely everywhere, just waiting to harass you at every turn.  That was unbelievably tiresome after a while, and the only way to fix it is a specific type of gear.  One of the other negatives is that the story gets so data heavy toward the end that I eventually just started skipping all of it- a neverending deluge of information when you just want the story to peak is not great.

Overall, if you like story driven, open world (ish) games, you'll enjoy this.",Wed Jan 05 22:28:55 EET 2022,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

6cc4ee74-bf8e-4324-9ef4-79bb4a29b81b,3,"I've been playing this game on and off for around three years, have a lifetime sub, and five alts to my main. My hours on Steam are not accurate as I have played this through the STO launcher, Champions Online launcher, and Arc. As someone who has well over 1000 hours invested into this game, I feel obligated to tell you this game is in no way P2W or paywalled. The people who say these things are either bad at the game or can't be bothered to get dilithium and buy ships. NO ship is overpowered, bar the Scimitar which is just ridiculous. Some ships excel at their role, yes, but there is no overpowered. PVP is dead, so anyone using that as a measurement is fighting against people who have invested time into their characters.On to the actual review. STO is a Star Trek MMORPG developed by Cryptic Studios, a company that is really passionate about their babies. There are glorious space battles to be had, as you go from ensign to admiral over your character's career. You start off against the Klingons in tradition Trek fashion and things quickly escalate. Missions are divided into arcs that act almost as seasons, with some very impressive set pieces that are played around with.The character customization is almost overwhelming, with just about every species having a place and the ability to customize your own alien species. This customizability extends to uniforms and bridge officers, who are like your companions in other games. You choose their looks, their weapons, and their abilities. Every character, yourself included, is divided into three careers: Engineering, Science, and Tactical. These give you basic abilities that you can use regardless of your ship, all of which are fairly useful. Tacs excel at damage, sci  toons can pull some space debuffing magic, and engineers are gods of fortifying their hulls with extreme amounts of health. Any captain can pilot any ship, regardless of what type of ship that is. There is no forced progression path into a certain ship.I'll touch on ships here, since that's what we're looking for. There are dozens of ships ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 6. You get a new ship every ten levels, stopping at 40. 40-50 is T5, with everything above 50 being T6. T6 ships can be bought for real money, earned frome events, or bought by converting dilithium to zen. The conversion rate is around 160 dil per zen, which fluctuates a fair bit. T6 ships cost 3000 zen, which might seem like a lot because it is. You can refine 8000 dilithium per day as a basic player, so it'll take a while to earn and refine that much. Once you fall into a nice pattern, this isn't something that seems grindy.The difficulty of the game is fairly low, although the average player might have some difficulties if they aren't aware of how the game works. This is a simple, but shockingly deep game. Don't worry about loot until you hit 50, then find what you want to do. The game doesn't have to be just about damage, everyone has a place.

The story was fun to play through in the beginning, but it gradually devolved to the same types of missions, involving the same types of quests. The regular events were okay, but only if you upgragded your ship to the hilt (which of course requires signficant invest of either real money, or real-time gridning). The strength of this game is the space combat, and I will admit I'm sometimes tempted to fire up the game just to take part in some space battles. There's multiple classes to choose from, and a wide variety of ships to utilize (some free, some paid), and you can also upgrade your ship with a variety of devices (new weapons, shields, engines etc.).But the ground combat - ugh. It looks bad, plays bad, and is buggy too. It really weighs the game down in places, and I found myself dreading beaming down during missions. I hardly played the event ground missions because they were resoundingly terrible, and the ground fetch quests? I cringe just thinking about them.I can't really recommend this game in good faith.

I've as since, downloaded the game through Steam. I've been playing STO since the very beginning, I've always been on and off(that's what she said), and I suppose having a lifetime membership has helped in that regard. After a number of updates, the ground combat, skill system, and crafting have went through a number of improvements, and I enjoy them how they are now. You can play ground combat like a shooter or traditional mmo, but feels good to mix and match now and then.Space combat is the real treat, and plays differently depending on how you equip your ship and what type of ship you use. Large scale battles can be a very nice spectacle to behold.The story of the game starts off about 30 years after the last original timeline movie(Star Trek Nemisis),  and the original timeline events spoke of in the 2009 movie, as such, Romulus has been destroyed. Each story sequence helps explore different aspects of each of the different show storylines. It's also been great to hear Star Trek Alumni reprise their roles.I'm still having fun in Star Trek Online, and will put hundreds more hours into it. You don't have to spend real money if you don't want to, but if you're spending time in the game, it might be nice to give something back every now and then. Star Trek online is a great game for fans of the franchise, unless they don't like space battles or the idea of ground combat. But keep in mind, there are also a few diplomatic missions as well and puzzle solving. That's it from me for now.-Live long and prosper.",Thu Jul 16 07:33:20 EEST 2020,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

The restriction on the level are really awful, I hate the RPG aspects of this game. A plus side is the foundry which allows you to make your own missions and play other people''s levels too.

You'll start off by captaining a ship, running missions and learning how to play, leveling is pretty quick and at any time you can jump in with your friends. The game auto adjusts your level so right off the get go you can play with your friends, just with fewer skills.As you rank up you'll no doubt realize just how Star Trek blends serious diplomacy with silly events with Q and other challenges in the quadrent. You'll play missions where a klingon ally starts gloating about a secret mission you completed, except his highly creative spin on the world turns what was a serious event of near certain destruction, saved by the Enterprise, to a complete turn around of events.I'm extremely picky about games, though not perfect, this is the best MMO I have played in my 25 years of gaming.

When my friends and I first heard about Star Trek, we were hoping that there would be open world(space) PVP.  Where we could cruise around in Klingon Birds of Prey and swoop up on unsuspecting Federation Tactical Noobs.  But alas, another franchise that did not implement an open world PVP server (that I ever found).  Unfortunately this results in STO being a rather tedious grindfest after a while, unless you find repetitive instanced quests to find better gear, etc. fresh and exciting.  $350 in total DLC options? Really?  Unless one of the packs overhauls the game and replaces it with an entirely new one, it's not worth it.  So as a free to play game its a grindfest, but it's Star Trek, so I recommend it if you don't mind the grind.  As far as DLCs go for this game, I really don't recommend putting money into this game at this stage, but if you like to spend $149 on a handful of intel ships, then be my guest.

b505f447-f70f-455d-b525-5c2eddeec0c8,0,"This game, like so many, has its ups and downs.  On the list of positives, there are things like the ship designs (which are really cool), the missions you get to go on (they all feel like actual things you would do if you were in a Star Trek episode), the fact that featured episodes are voice-acted (the most recent, involving the Sphere, has the actual voice of Worf from The Next Generation), the multiplayer element of the game (incl. PvE and PvP missions both on the ground and in space), and the events they run from time to time.  On the other hand, it gets really repetitive after a while...most of the things you do in missions are in text, not in actual minigames that you can play.One way this MMO departs from others is that the combat is not ""click-click-click you're dead"", to put it that way...you actually have to dodge the grenades the Romulans across the room throw, or set up turrets and lure Klingons into a trap.  The game also has a difficulty controller; if you think your missions are too easy, you can change to a higher difficulty for better loot and more of a challenge (seriously, enemy disruptor blasts consume a lot more shield HP in Expert than they do in Normal!).Its downfall is that it gets repetitive after a while.  Missions are usually ""oh, go kill that small fleet of Reman ships"" or ""take an away team down to the planet and scan relics"".  The crafting is also super boring; you need to collect (or purchase) a lot of items to put ship components together.The game has a slight pay-to-play nature, not nearly as bad as I've seen but still very existent.  You'll need ZEN (the microtransaction currency) to purchase some of the best ships, though if you collect enough Dilithium (an in-game currency that everyone is available to collect in fair quantities) you can trade it in for ZEN.  But it's going to take a lot of Dilithium to buy that Osperey Cruiser or Advanced Obelisk Carrier (the best ships cost 2500 ZEN, which is ~350,000 Dilithium, and you can only collect a few thousand per day at most, even if you're subscribed).Naturally there is an element of player-formed alliances; in this game they are called Fleets, and they can participate in otherwise closed battles against AI or other people, but I haven't gotten there yet.  You don't need to be any particular level to join a fleet, but lots of fleets will require that you reach the highest level in the game (currently lvl. 50, which translates to a Federation Vice Admiral).  The community doesn't seem too bad.  Also, leveling is a piece of cake.  All it usually takes is a single mission to gain a level.  Every 10 or so you get a newer, larger, better ship.All in all, I say give the game a shot.  You may find that its repetitiveness gets the best of you.  Or you may be taken away by the scenery as you blow other starships to bits (oh yeah, the graphics are pretty cool).",Wed Aug 04 08:28:15 EEST 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

It's a good ST combat sim SHIP-wise.... It was reminiscent of STSFC: Orion Pirates, but with a 3D environment, and changeable ship components.... Which is pretty damn cool.The downfall to this game is the somewhat clunky environments otherwise... like ship interiors (which are massive... Hallways feel more like gymnasiums) and the combat mechanics... It works somewhat like KOTOR, but not as well. You constantly beat down a barrage of enemies that are all the same, and just clustered to get in the way of your objective... And the missions are always linear...In the series, ship captains are always making life/death decisions, finding diplomatic ways to resolve things, solving puzzles and trying to keep their crew alive in the face of danger. In the MMO, you are forced to either follow the ONE path, with no decisions on your part, or shoot all the enemies in the area to death before they do the same to you. No choice in the matter.Regardless, the ship customization (name whatever you want, even) and having that customization stick, and be displayed... As well as the tedious but flexible system that allows you to earn in-game currency and use it to acquire things without breaking your wallet is pretty awesome. For the customization of characters and ships, as well as the ability to engage in good ship to ship combat (for the most part), I'd give this game a good rating....I'll just be staying off-planet for battles as much as I can.7/10 for this one.

ab7c0f04-ef74-4cfe-b3cc-b93001bfc821,10,"ITS AN OK GAME FOR FREE (had to make that bigger for some butthurt sto fans who can't accept its a buggy and pay2win game where they block you off at vice Admiral Ships lvl50 and you cant get ANY better ship unless you pay upwards of 15 to 40 dollars per ship so the game really hampers you once your Vice admiral) don't get me wrong but heres allll the reasons why they all need to be kicked in the balls except for their art team.1). 9/10 times when you try to go into the Interior of your ship the game will crash and throw you back to the login page were you will have to relog back in to then (hopefully) load inside your ship.2). 7/10 times the quests will not work properly the first time around, ie. not loading a certian area, not unlocking a door, simply the questline stops and refuses to advance, they poorly explain what they want you to do, some areas require you to do things the game never taught you to use let alone even tell you what abilitys and coomans you can give people, you'll have to figure that out yourself i suppose.3). The story is lacking (to me its boring and you can kinda see whats gonna happen next without much foresight.) 4). Poorly optomized idk how many times in cut scenes my guy will just stand up in his chair as my♥♥♥♥♥♥starts giving commands to my crew members as from my stomach up is out of the frame. If you actually read through the main stories you will see grammar mistakes and spelling errors which will make you cringe not because im a grammar nazi or anything i can't spell that great either but then again spell check is free and im not making a game and also asking for your money.5). The balls they have to have a sub service for this glitchy and bug infested mess of a free game. Maybe fix your game so its not a horrible buggy mess and maybe more people would wanna sub? Speaking of Bugs and glitches, if you thought Bethesda games had alot of bugs at launch try playing this game were its been out for 8 years and yet everytime you get on you think, ""How is this out of Early Acess?"" The amount of times you will run into Invisible walls in the middle of a wide open street, get stuff in a corner , or just get stuck on things in space. One time i ran into a Systems Sun and i wasn't able to get out of the suns area unless i restarted the gameNo creativity with the missions, most of the missions are Patrol missions but with harder enemies, after playing 3 different factions with 6 characters and all of them play into the same questline but with slightly different ways of going about it depending on if yer Klingon or Federation. Even when you hit lvl 60 and get to play as the Dominion, they have 1 unique chapter, and depending on what side you choose, your just do the beginning missions for each factions but just adjusted to your  level. For a free game its meh, game does a very poor job explaining what you can do in the game, it does a poor job getting you into the game (If you play as the 23rd century federation you meet Daniels while investigating  some weird thigns happening to star base. He introduces you to the Temporal Agents BS whatever and then when you hit lvl 30 ON THAT SAME CHARACTER you go to Danielsagain for a time mission AND HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF TO YOU LIKE YOU BOTH NEVER MET AND REINVITES YOU INTO THE TEMPORAL AGENTS THAT YOUR ALREADY IN) Seriously whoever did the storyboard, storyline, and story telling in this game should be shot over and over again. They put little to no effort into making sure the game runs smoothly and instead went for loot boxes, spending money on amazingly better then whatever you can possibly have ships, and over charged prices to unlock species. But again, its free so for a free game its slightly above a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and more of a small heap of♥♥♥♥♥♥with star trek flag next to it.Oh and I hope you like small puzle mini games that once again they explain poorly and you'll have to figure out by googling them rather then waste  time on an already half made game.Ive put alot of hours into this game reading the story playing most if not all the missions  i could, and ive had this game since it came out and you had to pay a sub fee for this hot garbage, NOw thats its free and pay2win alot of broke ♥♥♥♥♥es who only have a few hours think its a bee knees, and ya if you only play up to lvl 30 and 40 its great but once you hit 50 you get the full shaft of these developers saying. ""Pay me money if you want nice things.""Im glad the only thing they undated and improved over the 8 years since it launched was to ♥♥♥♥ over people with lootboxes and dangling any ship above Vice Admiral you have to either pay for , or buy a key for a lootbox which you may or may not get a ship.",Wed Jan 05 10:38:55 EET 2022,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103

My only grip with this game as it can get complicated, there is somewhat of a learning curve and it can be overwhelming to some players. Over all this game is well done and it does a good job connecting all elements of every star trek series. Id say if you are a star trek fan you cant go wrong. If you like complicated yet dynamic space exploration games youll like this game as well. Communitys however are a different story, it is hard for me to find americans that I can group up with.

bcad0af5-a7b5-4b81-9c0f-68c59513d0f6,7,"An all around good game in many ways. First off you have three factions, all with at least a few races in each. Both ground and space combat are solid however space combat is easily the better of the two. There is of course the Federation, the Klingons, and the newest faction which are the Romulans.The Romulans have a story of liberation and resistance against a nearly rogue sect of the now shattered Romulan Star Empire. You fly warbirds which at each new rank grant you a new ability only usable on warbirds. All of them can cloak and a later version can even split into two.The downfall of the Romulans in my eye is that they have no great massive ship of their own. I find the Ha'apax Advanced Warbird a bit lacking in that department. And even though you are in fact forced to join either the Federation or Klingons you cannot actually gain access to their T4 and higher ships. So I must recommend a mightier faction, one of glory and honor. The Klingon Empire.The Klingon story is far more diverse and even includes a small portion of the Romulan story, even including the Romulan end mission around lv32. The story ranges from house rivalries and betrayals to the return of Klingon enemies from ancient lore among other interesting developments. The Klingons are a faction with many mighty ships designed for head-on combat that have hull strength only rivaled by ships you'd have to spend $150 opening gambling boxes to get your hands on. And this does not even diminish their offensive capabilities as their greatest ship is a carrier armed just as well as any warship.The Fedration offers little that can compare to the might of the Klingon Empire. Their ships seem to be designed around a doctrine of agility as many of their ships are far smaller but probably just as effective in combat if used properly.There is also a system for crew missions, where you deploy your crew to go do things like sacking a colony, bribery, espionage, fighting in tournaments, trade agreements, asteroid mining for arguably the most valuable currency dilithium, among other tasks. These all net rewards which vary by the rarity of the mission, its difficulty, who's on it, and of course what the mission is in the first place determines the base set of rewards. You can even send one of your crew to be executed for incompetence as a Klingon, which even though its useless is just great to have sitting there as an option.The visuals are good, the game hasn't crashed once for me, the UI is customizable.All in all, a great MMO.",Wed May 05 18:50:34 EEST 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

07593b85-8037-48a5-89d6-65bac2117f95,9,"One of the best games I have ever played. Now let me explain why. I love...and I mean LOVE Star Trek, my fav series to be made on this planet we call home. Now the biggest reason why I love the game is because you not only get to be in the Star Trek universe and meet the shows Iconic characters. You get to side with one of the three series main factions. (Klingon, Federation, and Romulan) After choosing a faction to play on, you can choose one of the three classes. (Tactical, Science, and Engineering Officers) From here the story starts...you take a long time using the very well thought out character creation to make the best *You* in Star Trek as possible. From that you go ahead and start your missions in the main story. (Each faction will have there own beginning chapters and then it all comes together in the same story/missions) Do note that the Federation faction has a very slow and a little to long of a prologue chapter. Now as a new player that will be great, but I have played over 3.5 thousand hours on a non-steam client, and a few hundred or so on steam...till the steam client broke. Anyway, playing the game as much as I have. You get tired of doing that intro for the Federation over and over again. The plus side to this, they added the 23rd Century Federation as a new faction a while back. This being said you can not only play as a classic Federation character but play a new prologue to play and explore. As for the community. It is full of fun and Star Trek loving roleplayers. Yes roleplay is huge in this game, most if not almots all Fleets/Guilds will have roleplay be a normal part of the day to day tasks. With that said some Fleets will take it more realistic than others but still fun if you can find a Fleet that fits you. Adds tons of hours to the already great game. I have no idea if this review was helpful or just me being a Star Trek fangal...but I do hope it gave some light onto if you want to play the game or not.

Graphics could be better, yes, but this is an MMO, and for what it is, I think they've done quite well with it. I love the pre- and post-warp cutscenes and the transporter animations most, and some of the storyline talking cutscenes the least.The free to play part is a plus, too. It's a quality game, definitely, and doesn't simply lock you out of portions of the game just because you're free to play while others are premium, in fact, with enough effort, I'm sure you could accumulate enough dilithium to trade for substantial amounts of the premium in-game money (zen), which you can then use to buy the bigger, better, shinier, more premium things in the game.On a personal note, I'm happy with the game, and I'll be happy to continue playing. The best part is, once I tire of Federation quests (if I do), I can just make another character and experience Klingon or Romulan quests (you have more than enough character slots to make characters for each side). I think it's great that there isn't an entire side locked up for premium/paying users' use only, I think (though some races -- like the Joined Trill -- are locked up).Being free to play, I feel perfectly safe suggesting this game to anyone. If you don't like it, all you have to do is stop playing, because you didn't have to spend money on the game in the first place!",Wed Oct 27 01:59:27 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef
6a58bb69-9563-4f32-88ed-d4fe52e50dce,6,"I had a lot of fun with this game, and I never paid anything but my time. If you are a Star Trek fan, you have nothing to lose, and you'll probably enjoy what they've done with the franchise and your personal story. I was tempted to buy cosmetic upgrades because I am a nerd (""Ooh they have Kirk's jacket from Wrath of Khan! I want it!""), but I never felt like I had to pay in order to win. You definitely CAN - you can pay real money to buy upgraded ships with special technology - but I never felt pressured to do so.I really like the crew management element of the game - essentially, the special abilities of your ship are determined by your bridge officers. Bridge officers can be requisitioned from Starfleet or acquired on missions, which I thought was a nice touch. You can customize your bridge officers appearances in a very satisfying way, from their appearance and uniform to their stance. I got a boring Trill medical officer and made him much more interesting by making him twitchy and neurotic. Once you've customized a uniform for yourself or an officer, it's easy to save the outfit and apply it to whoever you want.The rest of your crew - rank and file - are mostly just pegs you can shuffle around to complete timed tasks and projects, with a variety of little rewards. I enjoyed this 'Starfleet Spreadsheet Simulator' in kind of a perverse way, sending my little dudes to formulate warp bubble theories and whatnot, but it's mostly a time-waster.The main problem with the gameplay is this: the ship-to-ship combat is much more polished than the away missions, but away missions are where you will spend most of your time. The on-foot sections of the game have very awkward and inconsistent level design. If I could delegate those bits to my redshirts, I would mostly do it, and enjoy the game more.I put it down when I didn't feel like playing it anymore, and I haven't picked it up again since, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing it. It didn't feel addictive or manipulative.tl;dr : Try it if you like Star Trek. It's actually free and not fee-to-pay.",Wed Sep 15 03:53:02 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

If you can get passed the loading screen and you REALLY like Star Trek then I would recommend it.  It is NOT for fans of MMOs as it is HEAVILY Star Trek based and is not really a very good MMO.  It is an ok game, but a lousy MMO.  The missions are repetitive.  The AI is pathetic.  The story is laughable.  Still it is typical of a Star Trek game.  In other words, it is really only for the few remaining fans of Star Trek who haven't been scared off by the reboot movies.",Fri Aug 27 21:03:17 EEST 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

d73c5e4f-81f6-42d6-bad5-defb9fb8f7cb,5,"So right off the bat, I'm going to make the claim that if you're a Star Trek fan, you'll find something to love about this game.Whether it's the episodic campaign that draws heavily upon the series and films. Or the vast overworld that allows you to beam down to many of the iconic locations you've come to know and love, such as Deep Space Nine, Starfleet Academy, Earth Stardock, Risa, and, taken directly from the most beloved film of the series, Paradise City from ST V. (Kidding.) Or just being able to run around your own ship or shuttle, most of which are inspired by, or are of the same class as, the ones from the show/films, and pilot it around the galaxy. There's something in this game for everyone.Since most people here have already covered the big parts of the game, I'll point my own personal list of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Fantastic Campaign: The devs for STO are big time Trek fans, and you'll definitely discover this once you start making your way through the campaign of your choice: Starfleet, Romulan, or Klingon. Each episode is formatted like an episode of the show, most of which are heavily inspired by plotlines from the show and films. Some of the episodes even continue the stories of some ST characters. Some devolve into shoot-'em-ups, but most -- especially the recent ones -- are 100% Trek, on par with the show. There are also player-created missions available to play through by way of the Foundry, which is awesome and something I wish more MMOs would incorporate.- Frequent Updates: Cryptic update the game with major episodic content a few times a year, most of which have featured actors reprising their roles from the series, such as Michael Dorn (Worf), Tim Russ (Tuvok), and Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar). Leonard Nimoy also narrates many key parts of the game in-character as Spock. Each new episode has added new story content, dailies, and general updates -- and all of them have been free. We've had one full-fledged expansion, Legacy of Romulus, and another one on the way in October called Delta Rising.- The Star Trek Experience: A lot went into making the game feel like a genuine Trek experience. The general atmosphere, the scale of the overworld, the missions, the visuals, locations, and characters. You take command of your own ship, and you can pretty much roll up any character you can imagine: from the stock races, such as Human, Vulcan, Romulan, Klingon, Betazoid, Trill, Orion, etc., to a custom alien race that you can define. There are also a lot of RP opportunites: Dabo(!), asteroid mining, ship interiors, and seasonal events. Just a lot of great stuff.- F2P Model: If I had to make a list of the most ethical F2P MMOs on the market... it would be a short list, but STO would be near the top. All of the story, PvE, and PvP content is free, as are all the updates. Most of the things Cryptic are making money off of are cosmetic items (uniforms, ship interiors/exteriors), ships (but the free ships are just as competitive), and services like inventory space, character slots, bank space, etc. The two things that I would count against it are the lockboxes, which can be easily ignored, and the two races locked behind a paywall, though with nearly infinite races available to you, it doesn't make much of a difference in my opinion. With a model like this, I've been happy to support it since I started playing.KHANS:- Sector Space: Initially, it's no big deal, but after some time you start to realize how unintuitive Sector Space can be, sectioned off the way it is. Can you land here, orbit, or do nothing? Why are there invisible walls in space? There's an event here, but is anyone participating? What does the event even entail? Cryptic have stated in the past that they want to give Sector Space an overhaul, which would be awesome, but we still have it for now.- Instance Stagnation: There are a lot of PvE and PvP instances to queue up for. People play a select few, but most have stagnated -- not from lack of players, just lack of interest. I'd much rather them not be there if no one's going to play them, so that Cryptic would be able to put more focus on the ones people still enjoy.- Community: Do yourself a favor and find a good fleet that you can get along with, because the community in STO, at least the vocal part, might just drive you insane. This is nothing new to online games, but it seems abnormal in a Trek game. Part of the reason might be how fragmented chat is in STO, which makes moderation rather difficult. Making chat universal across individual sectors would make things better, I think, but for now reading ESD chat might just make you go blind.I think that about covers it! Like I said, if you're a Star Trek fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a try, especially now that we're on the verge of a new expansion.Live long and prosper!",Fri Jul 17 21:22:08 EEST 2020,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103

Yeah, they advertise to earn cash, but the game costs money to run AND they have consistently added new content and new voice acting to make it worthwhile.  Ah, I have admittedly bought the most expensive option of each expansion, but then again... it's paid back for the total time spent.

Then I got to level 50, and was given access to the Delta Quadrant and Dyson Sphere. All the sudden, the wonderful mission's I'd been completing turned into 5-6 part grinds spanning over different areas, in different systems, in different sectors.... and I had one that I spent almost 2 hours trying to complete because even though I have the best ship in the ""free"" fleet, it does not match up to these enemies.

I can't get enough of it. It scratches every Star Trek itch I have, when it comes to gaming. It isn't pay to win, either...though paying does help a lot.

You can get whatever you want in the cash shop without spending a dime, you do this by mining and trading on the Dilithium market which is basically a form of currency that you can exchange for Cash Shop Zen. HOWEVER, be prepared to put in the time if you choose to go that route.  Biggest problem I have seen with this game is the players who actually play it. Those that dont put money into the game are constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the ""advantage"" other players have over them and Earth Spaceport has become a literal soapbox for these people to voice their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Despite the fact that if these people simply just put some time into the game they could have everything a paid player has access too as well. Putting money into the game is simply a time saving convinence, not a game breaking flaw. As many of these people would lead you to believe. Besides, there is a mission where you take a current generation Ship, slingshot around the sun, go back in time to TOS. And get drink recipes from Scotty... That alone should make you want to play. Graphics I have noticed are getting a bit dated and certain aspects of space combat will take you a moment to learn. But, other than that the game is enjoyable and fun.10/10 Would go back in time to get alcohol recipes from Scotty again.  ",Fri Apr 23 18:10:39 EEST 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

After Delta Rising, there was a simultaneous heavy double-nerf where raids and queues were increased in difficulty by large measures, while simultaneously slashing queue rewards.The grind, especially after level 50 just to get decent equipment is huge and extreme and the rewards underwhelming.  Pair this with the fact Cryptic and PWE aren't able to clearly communicate even basic information to the user makes for a very frustrating experience for new users or users that expect basic competence from a development entity.The game is slowly dying, Delta Rising itself has seen a pretty big downturn in users, and most of the late game mission queues are never populated as they are too difficult to complete for the rewards.If you jump in, don't spend a dime on the game.

My first quest is to go and talk to someone, so is my second one, and third, and fourth, and fifth (after it let me talk to the guy), and sixth. As my seventh quest I have to go and toast cuz I graduated from space-school or something before I get sent to a spaceship that; MAJOR SPOILERS OF SOMETHING NOBODY WOULD PREDICT IN A GAME AT ALL, the ship gets attacked. You then do yada yada for a couple of minutes (one of which was breaching a door I couldn't quite find because the doors don't work at all and you just go through all of them) before I get to control the ship (which the dialogue might explain but I skipped it.

There tons to do even if you reach the max level you still get points to spend on your character which is cool. The daily events also help getting rare and important equipment. There are alot of fan made missions as well just in case you want to take a break from the main missions and if you are stuck then other players if you ask will be there to help but the mission will get tougher with the more players in the mission. Also if you like clans then there are more then a few to join. My dislike is that when playing as UFP that sometimes you have to do some past missions you already done just to level up to the level that it wants you to be to carry on in the game which was a let down.

I found myself completing every main/side/errand quest and never felt bogged down with a million quests. Great balance of story/action, rewarding quest lines without getting lost in a rabbit hole of 10 million side quests. The world is interesting and immersive, the whole theme of the game, no stupid zombies or ""gritty"" (drab) post-apocalypse BS. Just a gorgeous game with so much to see and do and leave you wanting more. My only regret is that I'm not going tog get the sequel for PC for a while.",Thu Aug 12 00:13:47 EEST 2021,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5
1b6f0e68-67b7-4377-a9b9-70bbb19e9537,8,This is a great game for any star trek fan. I played it for a solid 3 weeks until I reached admiral level. From then on you are required to buy ships and equipemnet with real money if you want any chance to finish missons. So this means you'll get a good 50 hours gameplay until you have to reach into your pocket for mmo virtual products. So if your a star trek fan of any of the franchise give this a play for a few hours and decide after if you wan to spend money.The ship fights are great. The fan made missions are even better. The arrangement of your bridge crew adds fighting and mission abilites which is great. Complete customisation of your self crew and ship. The only downside I found was that every mission had you kill emeny ships. Its not very federation if your killing everything. The fan missions have a bit more of a true federation feel to them than the main ones. There is alot of fighting for a peaceful exploring space federation. Also its always updateing. If you dont update for a week itll be a good 10 min update waiting when you log in.,Sun Nov 21 17:28:22 EET 2021,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

But as somone who played that game from day one it is amazing to see how much this game has lived trough. The developers are really a group of dedicated folks. The game started out great in 2010 with some glitches of course. In seven years it turned into a even more amazing and enjoyable game. As a Star Trek fan I see it as an honor to consider this game as canon as the series and films.

ee22dae2-e65c-4860-956a-ea9925d41dc3,9,"I've played over 200 hours of this game. There is SO MUCH to it. From the moment you create your captain you're at the centrre of a canon storyline, and the game doesn't fail to deliver. EVERY star trek fan should want to sit in a captain's chair though, and doesn't need me to convince them. There is a little something for everyone though. It may sound like a silly aspect to judge, but the single player value to this MMO is insane, which is rare. Weather you party up, pvp, pve, RP, farm, grind or seriously roam around to take the sights it's easy to find something to do. Not just for star trek fans, but as a trekkie obviously worth checking out. Pay to play aspects coupled with ruthless marketing take away from the enjoyment, though everthing purchasable with money is possible to farm or grind for - albeit very tediously. My advice, spend your time having fun with the game until you unlock the end game ships, save up enough game currency to buy keys for lockboxes in auctions and try your luck for high tier ships that way. I ended up purchasing a t6 ship as a reward for hitting the level cap with no regrets. Best:High level of customization and choice 3rd person gameplay while on planet is good, if a little generic. But space battle mechanics are AWESOME. Best space battles in an online game by far imo. Story and lore written in star trek canon, lots of interesting locations, characters and situations trekkies will recognise, but it's not necessary to be familliar with literally any of it in order to enjoyMostly friendly communityGreat graphics, music, voice work, UI, controls, tutorials and a very large, interesting world to exploreDifficult gameplay - not just a matter of spamming a rotation of class abilities-there are tactics involved.Worst:Dev support has left much to be desired, although just for things like gameplay bugs. Community support and store support are dependable. Frequent updates and patching - means more down time, more bugs. Unfortunately most of the updates are made to the store and are designed to make players want to spend money. This would not bother me if previous updates were more stable before attention was made to updating again. A bit buggy. Shouldn't have to explain this. Nothing that breaks the game, but I've had to restart missions enough times that I should probably mention it. Freemium. Hate this. I know it's the future but it takes away from the enjoyment for everyone except the people it exploits. If you don't let this get to you, and indeed it is not SO bad compared to other freemium games, the purchasable items are excellent and there is a large attention to detail and value. Before you purchase anything I reccommend unlocking the lvl 60 ships or higher first. Overall the game is not perfect, may have been better as a subscription game, kinda lost its soul a little bit because of in game purchasing - but the developers and community have managed to keep the game very fun despite the small hangups. The engine and mechanics in this game alone are worth checking out. For the record, this is the only MMO that I've held even remote interest in for more than 6 months. Long story short: It's free, fun as hell, and the main problem is that without spending insane amounts of time mining or spending real money you really can't compare to the players that do. If anyone who plays it and doesn't enjoy it wants their $0.00 back I'll happily refund.",Sun Nov 14 20:54:30 EET 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

It's pretty fun. However I feel at some times the game can feel a little generic or basic, but it makes up for it. While the ""on-ground"" combat seems to be really easy, the ship combat is very fun and requires a lot of strategy, it can get really intense during some points in the story.However the lack of explanation and walkthrough after you finish the tutorial is horrible, I had to figure out how to navgate the menues all on my own.Generally overall it's still a really fun game I'd give it somewhere between a 7/10 to 8/10, the game has room for improvememts.Also if the game looks blurry to you look for an option that says ""resolution"" and slide it all the way to 100%, I almost stopped playing because I thought the game was supposed to be this blurry.",Sun Jul 11 15:35:11 EEST 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

b41b40b7-ed3e-4177-ab1f-ec07cccdeca7,4,"When screenshots of the planned ""Star Trek Online"" game were first teased almost a decade ago, it looked like a simulator for living in the Star Trek universe, much like the original Star Wars online game experience before it got ruined by patches and so on. A true sandbox for Star Trek-ness. However, it was taken over by another developer, one known for making comic-like games and generally actionning and arcade-ing things up to the max. My heart sank, because my favourite Star Trek games before then were games that simulated life on board your starship of choice.Bridge Commander for PC was one of those games, I'd go back and download all the old Star Trek games now and then and play them just to see if any were good, and some were excellent. Another was the Interactive Technical Manual/Captain's Chair set of games, which made it so that you could walk through little 360-degree photograph simulations of the ships and learn all sorts of things about everyone. Also one game that gets little to no cred is the Elite Force expansion for PC also, which took the Star Trek Voyager game and made it so that you could explore the ship, mess with the systems, play on the holodecks, and so forth. It took a good 3 hours to push every switch, which isn't long, but it's a good slice of life if you want to experience a walking simulator about ST:VOY. Also the new VR game looks to have some of that spirit - maybe.Star Trek Online is the antithesis to all of that. There's no classic roaming about and taking in the scenery, no smelling the roses, and for some reason the corridors are ridiculously huge - all the bridges and so on are blown up to the size of small soccer fields, even the one for the shuttlecraft looks like a basketball court you could do laps in. It's inulting to me as a veteran gamer, since I'm stuck wondering - ""what, are they expecting so many casual players who have never tried to play an online game before, that they had to make it so they wouldn't be frustrated walking into walls all the time? is it literally made for mentally challenged people?!"" I've never seen a game put so much freaking walking space everywhere. The transporter pads which are supposed to be somewhat uncomfortable to stand on with 5-6 people are suddenly these huge affairs the size of a moderately-priced living room. O_o; smhNo, you could say that STO tries to bring back the feeling of Original Series Star Trek, with Kirk facing a new escapade each episode and generally the ships and life and so forth falling into the background. I used to despise the Original Series for being too fast and loose with ... well, logic itself, frankly. Sometimes, most of the time in fact, the things the crew encounters and their reactions to it make a lot of sense. But now and then there was just no sense to what they were doing at all, and what my mom calls ""60s values"" were everywhere - people getting angry for absolutely no reason, being ""chivalrous"" (almost mocking) towards female crew members, and so on. I've recently watched TOS in its completeness and I have a much greater appreciation for it now, I found the fun in it as it were. But even Roddenberry seemed to back off from the feeling of the original, considering the way that the early Trek movies became almost pedantic affairs about Shakespeare and philosophy and politics. I like those best I think, out of all the Trek stuff that's been created, but this game seems to mostly if not entirely abandon those principles in favor of BANG! BANG! Space cowboys to the rescue!The thing is, it works. The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager all seemed to want to be saying something more fun and action-oriented than they actually did, esepcially in the episodes involving scary new species or little special events featuring warzones. It's like there was this anxious little boy hidden away inside the hearts of the producers, and every now and then he'd come out and for several episodes we'd just have a general romp around the galaxy, with torpedoes blasting around and so on. That's where Star Trek Online shines. It takes the time period from those series and tries to make it work as a series of TV-style episodes, which are crystallized into about a dozen quest chains (yes, that's all there is in the game for my faction, but they are relatively long - several hours at minimum each, more like 12-20 hours for some). Want to see Denise Crosby finally getting some serious attention in any Trek franchise? Well, here her performance as Empress Sela is charming and impeccable.The difference between STO and the actual TV shows is that while some of the best story arcs in the entire Star Trek universe - all the 29th century nonsense, the Year of Hell characters, the DS9 take on the Mirror Universe, and so on - were mostly ignored after their individual episodes and two-parters, the creators of Star Trek Online took the most interesting and audacious ideas and expanded them into significant things which affect everyone on a daily basis almost. More fun, more action, more romping around, more crazy conspiracies and interesting intrigue than the shows were usually willing to do. If the original shows were vanilla-flavored, this is artisinal chocolate with jalapeno sauce. The difference between fan theories and the actual material, especially when it comes to Star Trek fans, is that the fans come up with intellectual extensions that make it cool for nerds but are impossible to justify when you're marketing to a general audience who are just expecting to turn on their television sets and get a decent story. This does the fun nerdy ""footnotes section at the Memory Alpha wiki"" stuff that hopefully you've wanted to see (if you're a Trekkie).I tend to love and play (and review!) games which are kinda poopy when taken as a chance to fulfill one's hopes and dreams about what a person can do in a virtual world, but are immensely enjoyable when played on their own terms. This is a game which is best played on its own terms. It tries to take the pre-reboot storyline and tie it together with almost everything that's ever been created in Star Trek.. happening all at once, in a coherent storyline. For the most part, the writers (who are these gods?) manage to tie a whole bunch of ridiculously contrived continuities from the creators into something much more coherent than it originally was. It might slip past you if you don't care about the plot or aren't paying enough attention, but seriously, this game turns BAD (with a capital B!) episodes from the TV shows into something that makes sense and can actually form a long story that ties in with others. Play it for the episodes and very little else, and you'll find a fanfiction-style work that ties things together with amazing detail.My only real complaint is that literally nobody plays the PVP anymore, as far as I can tell. Want to use that amazing new ship you bought for more than your own personal masturbation in the latest quest line to be released? Well, tough. Apparently enough people ruined it early in the lifecycle of the game that you just can't find anyone to play with anymore. The PVE Queues the game has, where everyone defends against the Borg or whatnot, are full 24/7, and an excellent way to level (you can get 90% to the level cap within 12 hours if you just keep running them!). However, the PVP queues are at zero, zero, zero, zero, zero for every match type, all day and all night, with little to no flukes where there are suddenly more people in them. There's just nothing. I really wanted to try PVP even if it sucked, but I guess it's back to living through some pretty interesting Star Trek episodes for me. :) Which is both a blessing and a curse, as is most of this game.Accept STO as the flawed piece of semi-trash that it is, and you'll find plenty of treasures within, it just might be best to wait for enjoying them until you're in the mood to appreciate something that might not be perfect.",Tue Dec 21 15:53:24 EET 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

e606f02c-fcbf-4708-8599-dd4c2f556a6f,4,"Star Trek Online (STO) is a solid MMORPG with tons of customization option for those who are willing to work for it.  It is not, however, a good Star Trek game.  For me, the main draw of Star Trek isn't so much the science fiction, which let's face it, is on the silly side.  It is the characters, the dynamics between the crew that makes it interesting.  In-game, however, crew members are treated as little more than equipment, so that personal connection is gone.  You gain the ability to customize your officers however you want, true, but you lose what makes them characters.Another problem of the game is the randomly generated sidequests.  Sure, it's fun to pretend that you are the star of your own Star Trek show, routinely investigating strange species, artifacts, and negative space wedgies, but the mad-lib style of quest generation means that after a while, all these quests seem to blur together.  So aside from the story quests - which are well done, by the way - none of the other content is memorable.The saving grace for these sidequests is the Foundry, which allows users to create their own quests and stories.  Sturgeon's Law is in full effect here; 90% of the custom content is lackluster, but the other 10% makes it worthwhile.While the game has problems that prevent it from being truly great, I would still recommend it for MMO gamers.  The universe feels big, the ship-to-ship combat is frantic but tactical (although sometimes you fight with the UI more than the enemy), and the amount of reference to the Star Trek shows can make Star Trek enthusiasts giddy.  If these sound exciting, that this is the game for you.",Thu Jul 29 02:49:10 EEST 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

I mean, the graphics could use a tad bit of an overhaul, but other than that, it is absolutely amazing.Farming for levels to pass through the main storyline? Tch, forget that. Instead, they give you a whole freaking squad to support you in your endeavours, and each mission is specifically designed to level you up, so you need not worry too much about advancing levels. There are special ships, but they're not available straight off the bat, even with purchases, the ships and weapons are restricted by level, as are equipment and such, ensuring an almost always fair game (There are exceptions, but that's just because the other guy has a good weapon combo, not because they're OP.), and in group events, everyone gets a cut of the experience (Some less than others, either because the majority are high levels, or vice versa). You'll be so addicted to the storyline that you'll have a threatening dreanought before you know it!The storyline itself... It's just so addicting, anyone who's watched a Star Trek movie will feel like they're in one. You'll rise among the ranks relatively quickly, and getting through the main campaign is in no way a grind. There's always something new and interesting to it, and by the time you're done, you'll be begging for more. I've never experienced a more exhilirating storyline.

It consists of 6 missions if you choose to create a character from the Starfleet of the 23rd century, and also about 4 other missions towards the middle of the game whereby you become a Temporal Agent.The storyline takes you to various different locations and various timelines, most notably: the JJ Abrams Timeline (or the Kelvinverse) where the U.S.S Kelvin was destroyed in battle (presumably). In this timeline, you assist the U.S.S Yorktown against Na'Kuhl Raiders who are trying to destroy the timeline hence creating a weapon against the Federation. There are several ships added in his DLC, all of which, however, cost REAL MONEY. I have to say, however, that they are very unique and powerful although I am surprised at the lack of a Kelvin Timeline Constitution Class (T6). The DLC itself feels and looks very much like the TOS sounds and graphics I wanted but does not give me the option to change to the 2410 style later on when the TOS effects seemed to get slightly annoying, Other than this, it felt almost empty as the storyline ended abruptly.

and this whole process will cost you hundreds of dollars in real life money. now imagine you have to upgrade the warpcore, engine, deflector, shield of your ship and now even imagine you have 50 ships all with different gear. this will cost you thousands of dollar just to upgrade all your old stuff that you have already aquired and paid with real money. they let you pay again and again and again your stuff that you have already bought. sto is not worth the insane high costs, its maybe worth 10 bucks per month at all. you could fill a 1tb drive full with games for the money sto wants from you. i had a little trick i have used to avoid the insane high costs in form of real money. i had in the end 27 chars and 20 alts all level 50 that i have used to farm ec, dilithium, commodities, contraband and i was a heavy multibox user. because of this little trick i could aquire everything in the game, i had everything and all ships you could get. this means i have started sometimes up to 10 game clients and i was logged in with 10 different accounts at once. i did cycle though all 47 chars to get all the doffjobs done on all of my chars. i mainly used the refugee, prisoner, officer doff exchange assignments to get more very rare and rare doffs and sell them on the exchange. all i did was switch between the game windows and do doff assignments for doffs, contraband and commodities or i did path to 2409 or did mine dilithium with my 47 chars or did the cristalline entity event and idled with 10 chars at the startpoint lol. sometimes i have played more than 18 hours per weekend day! i made trillions of ec and millions of dilithium(trade 5 contraband for 2000 dil ore every 4 hours with my 20 alts chars plus 1 main char). i did not pay a dime for the new greed rising extension, i have farmed over 2,5 million dilithium and traded it for zen and bought the dr pack ingame for 12,5k zen. i was very dissapointed by the delta rising pack, the new t6 ship are ugly beyond imagination, the stats of the ships are horrible, everything is broken in delta rising nothing works. i couldnt even login more due to crashes and server timeout and game freezes every few minutes. sto has no beta testers, we the endgame customers are the alpha and beta testers. i said to myself enough is enough, screw that. i have deinstalled sto and sold my main account. i will never again play a mmo or sto. i bought now battlefield 4 with premium and all unlocks. now i play maybe every 2 or 3 days bf4 for 2 or 3 hours per day. i only play bf4 if i really have the time and nothing else to do. i have also no monthly followup costs like in sto. i bought bf4 once and have never again to pay anything and bf4 is now 99% gameplay and fun and only 1% grinding and for the first time in 3 years i have seen a real working game support, thanks for that. now after my horrible sto experience my whole life has changed to a very good life, i have now more sleep, more energy, more money, more time, more friends, more sun, more of everything, im so glad i stopped playing sto.",Mon Sep 14 06:20:48 EEST 2020,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

It's not the subtle intergallactic diplomacy styling of the TV shows; Star Trek Online takes more after the movies with more action and more conflict.This isn't a bad thing, the space combat has become more and more satisfying over the years and the complexity of situations improve every mission.The ground combat has improved enough to be fine, but isn't the most enjoyable part of the game. This is where the crew you bring on missions are helpful; they balance a lot of the quirks out and allow for some customization. In reality, if you take ground combat partially seriously it's alright and there's no real penalty for wiping on mission so the problems are ignorable.Since the game has been around for a few years, the ships available are many and wonderful. If you wanted to fly ships from the Dominion War perfect! Want to play a period-specific Enterprise from earlier shows and movies? They have that too.

7b16485f-5e36-442a-9fdd-300e75b5067e,0,"I would recommend this game to those who enjoy space battle games, MMOs, or specifically Star Trek! The game contains a lot of elements I enjoy, lacks in a few areas, but mostly is a great game! I tend to take my time, with my own method of how I play the game, making logs for every mission I do. Like an actual Starfleet Officer would do, as far as I know. The whole Star Trek franchise is my 3rd favorite (set of) show(s). The games story throws me off, the Federation allied or has a peace treaty with both the Klingons and the Romulans, I don't know why they are considered enemies. Especially when the 3 sides that you can be on, don't really fight one another. I haven't gotten much into the campaign yet to really know and understand the story, but as far as I can tell, I just enjoy being able to be a Starfleet Officer and having my own ship, and of course making my own logs.Issues I have with this game:1. You can't customize your ship fully. You can, somewhat, but I wish there was a more detailed way to modify your ship.2. You can't change your first officers information. This kind of bugged me, I wish I could change my first officers details just as I can change my first officers appearance, but the game doesn't allow it.3. You can't train your officers in like a holodeck program, which I wish you could build your own training programs and have access to a holodeck program. That way you can train your officers and even earn experience for yourself, maybe?4. You have to buy a lot of things with no free way really to earn a few Zen coins every now and then.Other than the issues I have with the game, the game is really fun and enjoyable! Even for a MMO. Although having it a single player game would have been cooler, that way they probably would of payed attention to how you build your ship, or design your character, and all of that rather than focusing on how the PVP system will work. Like with most MMO's, you can't really summarize the story without going through most of the game. So I can't summarize the story for this game.",Fri Feb 26 08:18:51 EET 2021,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

It has drastically changed over time, for the most part not positive.First of all, in my opinion, this game has little in common with the spirit of the original Star Trek series and films.It is a standard MMORPG on a generic engine that happens to be in a cartoonish colored version of the Star Trek Universe. You mainly run/fly around click on static dialogs and kill millions of enemies. SpaceAs the game reaches its 5th anniversary, Cryptic's Star Trek Online universe grew to an acceptable size. Unfortunately it is not an unlimited and contigous space. Instead this overall 2D universe is devided into 3D ""Sector Blocks"" (maps) with unpassable hard borders, so that you are hopping from one block to another beiing shown a loading screen as you are travaling through it.In addition, every map gets instanced, if a certain player limit (i tthink 20-40 players) is reached, so that you never will experience the massiveness of MMORPG.GroundI'll skip the ground part. I think, it does not differ much from every other game of this kind except that heavy ""instancing"" and ""zoning"".Revenue ModelIn theory, the Free to Play acccess grants access to the whole content, but you'll be disapointed rapidly. In fact the free access is restricted to storyline, all areas and basic equipment and few basic ships. Everything else has to be either bought or exchanged/upgraded in exchange for diverse in-game currencies. It is possible to earn them, but it is an endless, monotonous, boring and repetitive ""grinding"" and Cryptic did set a limit for a daily income of the main currency called refined dillithium, You are forced to came back and login every day to earn it and even then you will be always short of it. Or simply buy them for real money.Then you have the c-store where you can buy expansion packs, items, most ships and ""services"" which expand your account with real money or exchanges refined dillithium.Furthermore Cryptic invented a lottery/ casino system for special items and ships packed in boxes with unpublished win chances, but they are told to be very, very small. You can participate with using real money among others and can't be sure to ever win.With the latest Expansion ""Delta Rising"" the costs for high-rank equipment increased drastically. And you badly need it to successfully participate in the end-game elite content, where practically the only important ability is, to deal the most damage per second (dps) to the enemy.ConclusionSo if you don't want to stuck at easy difficulty in pre-endgame state, the game ends up being either a second job/chore to earn all currencies/materials/marks/... or a serious cash investment for virtual stuff and Cryptic's casino with equivalent nofun-factor.",Sun Apr 04 16:12:49 EEST 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

I got to max level with almost every character I made, and I can tell you this: It was fun, but once you reach level 50, even though there are ten more levels to go, you're done. Finished. There is an apalling lack of endgame content, and there probably won't ever be any. The devs don't care at all about this game. My opinion? If you want an MMO (regardless of genre) I recommend Elder Scrolls Online (or ESO for short). Even though it's not free, it's still exponentially better, and more content is being made all the time. You can also really tell that the devs enjoy their job and care about making a good game, unlike in Star Trek Online. Just never play a free MMO, even if it is Star Trek. Even if you can ignore all the obnoxious money grabbing from the crappy developers, in the long run, it's almost never worth it.",Tue Oct 26 08:21:57 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

You get the option to run about smacking Vulcans and Bolians with a bat'telh and then blow away some much heavier Federation ships in need of an attitude adjustment.  Even on Klingon side, after I smoked a Chimera dreadnaught (one of the biggest boats out there) in a B'rel Bird of Prey (the starter ship) I felt very much like I'd seen everything there was to see here.Playing Federation, on the other hand, was just insultingly silly.  Going from the academy to the captain's chair in the space of an afternoon, in the company of your bubbleheaded teenybopper classmates who all seem to think they're going to be captains too sometime soon, just wrecks all suspension of disbelief.  As does taking an old clunker of a training ship out, running into a Borg cube, and NOT getting owned in five seconds.  Sorry, I don't see how I'm supposed to take that seriously as either a Trek fan or a newcomer just looking to blow stuff up in space.A few very notable nice touches, though the memorial to the Star Trek actors and crew who have passed away was both touching and depressing (the list of names is really, really long...).

Everything that can be bought can be earned in game if you bother to look into it. Paying obscene amounts of money dulls out the game and makes it unplayable after a rather short curve. The community (with exception to the Starfleet faction; unconfirmed with the Original Series factions, I have not yet played deeply with them) is astounding and helpful, even at times being more helpful than gamemasters, though not extremely often. The dev team is wonderful, one of the best I've seen.Everything worth owning encourages you to play with a fleet or armada. The game itself is emersive and flexible to play styles, and many portions are done either alone or with a group if you take a minute to find one. The scaling difficulty means you can play anything any time and join your pals when it suits you.I'll admit, if you have/had a character who was between level 45 and 50 before the massive refit a long while back, the grind is tedious at times to build the crafting skills without help. The dev team did a fair job making up for a lot of that. You can communicate with people or guilds from other games by Perfect world using the default chat, meaning if you want to go play Neverwinter, you can chat up your fleet or vis versa. The first 50 levels are over rather quickly, especially if you aren't dunking your head in plasma coolant on Earth Space Dock (which I might add is the most immature region in the game), once you get past them you'll start exploring most or all of the new content. Any mission or quest task you don't want to play you can skip as long as you're properly leveled and provided it isn't also a campaign tree, which begin to be available after achieving level 50.I'd give the game a 9/10 average.And to finish, who doesn't like blowing stuff up on a massive scale with death rays and proto cannons?",Mon Feb 01 16:51:18 EET 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

By this time I had only one real space battle and it was easy.  It was during the tutorial and I was pretty sure to win.  This was my second space battle.  I had teamed up with three friends who had also just started to play as well.  We got the third wave of 7 Federation vessels before it was to much.  I spent the majority of the this space battle trying to keep pointed at a vessel to get the most of my weapons to fire at 1 target.  Yes I had my cannons/turrent/torpedos on repeat fire, no the enemy didn't go down easily.  I had to keep moving otherwise turning was stupid slow.  Then I had to mitigate my shields, coordinate with my teammates on which targets we were trying to take down, use my evasive maneuvers, and keep eyes on the enemy.  This is a lot to throw on to me as a new player.  There was nothing fun at dying that much in the first for real space battle.  The graphics were fine.  The dialog was fine.  The WOWesk game play was fine.  I stomach through a lot to get to that first battle and it taught me a valuable lesson.  Star Trek online is not for me because of it's space battle system.  Heck, take out the space battle system and Star Trek online is not for me because the rest of the game was fine.  Not good, not moderate, just fine.

I'm sure there are many people who consider this to be fun, but for me it has gotten quite tedious and has limited my ability to enjoy the gameplay. In addition, PvP is dead, if you want PvP, go somewhere else, it's all PvE in STO. If you like that, then great.I honestly started playing it because I was interested to see what they were doing with the prime universe. There's some great stuff in there, especially the New Romulus stuff. But I got to a point where I had to grind ceaselessly in order to unlock more missions and I stopped caring. Too much grinding for far too little reward. But that's the nature of F2P, hey? I don't doubt that it works, STO is going strong and is always full of people.

f3ed0d38-795c-4df2-b7d8-ebdc03f8c709,5,"Star Trek Online, on the very surface is a very enticing idea; which is appealing at first... and disappointing later.Basically, it's a 'mixed bag'. STO allows you to play as a lot of Star Trek races and use a variety of ships for free, but, annoyingly, it doesn't let you 'refit' ships directly for late-game play when you're up against the tougher enemies. Instead, you have to BUY (or, do LOTS and LOTS of grinding for) individual upgraded versions of ships, or some ships that are ONLY for late game play. The combat is okay but very repetitive and cares more about getting you to waste money on better gear than actually being fun. Sure, it feels like Star Trek, but at the same time either makes crap up outta nowhere or even completely defies canon, even though it's supposed to NOT be an alternate universe... Good job, guys...To make matters worse, the clothing and posture options are very frequently restricted by gender(every skirt, numerous tops, etc.) even though Star Trek is intended to promote full gender equality, and the TV show actually shows guys wearing skirts and skimpy tops and all those female-only(in STO) items and vice versa at times. Worf was even once told he looks good in a dress! Another point I'd like to make is that for a 'free to play' game, there is a TON, a TON of grinding and paywall nonsense; and many of it is even dependant on GAMBLING real money for a slim chance at getting something decent, while almost every time, you'll be getting garbage-equivalent. In conclusion, the voice acting is often terrible(or not even there, so you need to read dialogue...), many species cost money, ANY SHIP outside a select few 'free' ones(which are useless outside the early game) are expensive(from 25 to 250 dollars!)(not exaggerating), it violates canon on many occasions, it provides terrible fan service constantly, your character is frequently given false choices that all have THE SAME result, the story is lazy, the animations are awful, the gameplay is gimmicky at best, the whole game is constantly getting glitches that need patching, and perhaps most importantly, the so-called role-playing game is constantly taking away your chance to alter the course of events and doesn't make you feel like your character actually matters to the plot at all; in essence, it is a (bad) story 'happening around you'. Summary:Positive aspects: Star Trek -like appearance. Decent space combat. Good sound effects. Multiplayer is available. Good graphics(terrible animations)Negative aspects: Too many to count; some of the bad ones that came to mind this particular day are written above.",Wed Aug 18 07:21:34 EEST 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

The stories are meh imo, but the just flying around a Galaxy or an NX Class is pure joy.Getting to the end game is easy enough, but once there, I have found the game to have stalled. Unless you spend your entire life mining dilithium to transfer it to Zen, you can only get better stuff by spending money.The subscription for monthly Zen, or just buying Zen as and when you need it. The end game free ships, are to be honest... naff. You either need to spend ridiculous amounts of in-game money to buy keys from the Player Run Exchange/Auction House, or spend Zen to buy them.

fbb58ea2-8568-4004-bb7c-634b5799c38f,1,"Excellent game, in my opinion, despite it's flaws. Some Pros:- Beautiful vistas- Engaging Ship-to-Ship combat- extensive content, with no need to spend real money in the cash shop- active community- Missions can be skipped if high enough level- XP is easy to earn, via Duty Officer Assignments, which allow you to set up ""over night"" missions for experience and resource gain.- Well-Balanced gameplay and PVP combat.Some Cons:- Dilithium (used to buy ZEN coins for cash shop) rates are extremely high... 120-130 Dilithium = 1 ZEN Coin = $0.01 USD- Away Missions seem to take forever, and aren't nearly as engaging as the Space Combat.- For a game that takes place during a time of war, there isn't a lot of war going on... not even between players of opposing factions. A PvP Territory Control Wargame would easily fix this, and while there are unofficial versions made by fans, I'd rather have one that doesn't require me to keep track of updates on another, third-party website.- Fleets (Guilds) are difficult to get up and running when you're only a few members strong.

But the hilarious dichotomy between playing as the peace-loving Federation and the fact your throat is raw from screaming at your bridge officers to fire all the torpedoes aside the space combat is a fantastic amount of fun! Sure the difficulty spike post lvl 50 will have you choking on your own bile and other bodily fluids but... actually no that's about it. Good luck! It's totally possible to push past that barrier, but I won't lie it's difficult and if you do that's when you hit the real paywall.And now would be a good time to mention what you'll find in everybody else's negative reviews. They're right. Not little bits here and there. All of it. They nickel and dime you for every little thing. New characters, new bridge officers, duty officers, removal of cash limit, costumes, the benefits of the lifetime membership which you have to wait to unlock incrementally after you buy it, and last but literally the most important thing in a game about space: spaceships! Pay to Win? What? That's not a question. It's just rhetorical. Find your nearest STO player in real life. Chances are they don't do drugs! Because of instead of giving their money to a drug dealer they gave it to STO! ...I just ...I feel this fits somewhere in a morally grey area of what ends up being worse and the answer is ALWAYS zone chat. *shudders*Anything else you find in negative reviews? Like I said: totally true. Grind? Horrible. Fun? Absa-freakin-lutely. The combat is fun. Figuring out what works is fun. Working on your ship(s) is fun. Heck testing out your ships is the REALLY fun part. Shenanigans with your fleet is FUN. Teasing the randoms you meet in queued missions while you silently remember what you used to be is FUN. When the devs break the game after every update and you just keep finding things for like a week or more afterwards? Aggravating. But fun to complain about with your fleet members.I've gotten through this entire review really without mentioning that it's Star Trek. Because I do believe the gameplay stands up on it's own. Especially considering how old the engine for this game is. And that Star Trek veneer over this whole thing really sells it. It bleeds Star Trek, especially in the earlier campaigns. The more you look and know about the shows the more references and detail you see and in a way it makes the game more vibrant.So whatever half of this review appeals to you the most, like it hate it whatever, go for it.

5c8f9d10-4c91-404d-b729-f8795f325437,6,"This game is definately worth playing if you are a fan of the Star Trek Universe. The graphics are a little choppy and outdated, even on maximum settings it is not the greatest BUT it is also by no means the worst and you will quickly adjust to it and even forget about it due to the immersive and interesting nature of the Universe and the plotlines unless, of course, you are one of those people that cannot find joy in a game unless it is using the most recent graphic technology. The storylines are interesting, there are a myriad of options and a great deal of depth to the game when it comes to improving your ship, outfitting it with new equipment, training your officers, dispatching them on missions and so forth. The customisation for your ship and captain/officer uniforms are expansive and very detailled. Most of them do not require Zen to purchase.There is a LOT of complaining regarding this game when it comes to the lockboxes and Zen purchases. It is worth saying that there is absolutely NO need to purchase ANYTHING in order to experience and enjoy this game to the full unless you are an impatient person who objects to having to put some EFFORT in to the game in order to reap the best rewards. So, if you want to get the best things quickly and zerg your way through everything without having to actually work for it like some over priveliged snowflake then be prepared to pony up some cash or have your self indulgent whine about it and go play something else that better fulfills your need for instant gratification. However, if you appreciate rewards gained for time and effort leading to an actual feeling of ACHIEVEMENT when you finally get that top tier ship you always wanted then you won't have any problems with this game. In any case, you will be given a new ship of a type of your choosing every 10 levels and most things available via Zen can actually be purchased via the Exchange (Star Trek's version of the Auction House). There is NO NEED at any point EVER to open the many, many lockboxes you will be given or pick up during your gameplay unless you want to.** I did have one issue with Crytic when I first started up that is worth a special note! ** Basically their website refused to accept my card details when I tried to subscribe and so after two attempts I ended up subbing via Paypal. Now, the two attempts in which I tried to use my card actually resulted in Cryptic putting two ""hold"" transactions on my bank account for Â£1 each. Not a lot of money and not a problem for me financially, but it was unauthorised and without my being notified in any way, thus I had a huge problem with it! I contacted their customer support via email and received a response within 2hrs in which I was informed that this is standard procedure and their way of checking that the card details are, in fact, valid. They stated the money would be returned to me in 10 WORKING days, and it was. In fact it was never actually taken from my account. I confirmed with my bank directly that this was the case as I actually tried to reclaim the money at first thinking this was some sort of scam and they informed me they could not reverse the transactions as unauthorised until the money had actually been withdrawn by Cryptic, however the funds reappeared at the end of the 10 working day time frame. So, if this happens to you just bear in mind that despite the fact there is NOTHING on their subscription pages informing you this will happen, it will likely happen unless you have made a purchase with them before so don't panic like I did! They really should make it clear to customers that this is the case though as I was VERY angry when I noticed the two unauthorised transactions on my account and had my bank waiting to open a fraud case against Cryptic as they never informed me of this and I did not consent to it at any point. Use paypal. Trust me.",Mon Aug 17 02:39:24 EEST 2020,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c
5c8f9d10-4c91-404d-b729-f8795f325437,10,"I love Star Trek. I always have, and I'm pretty sure I always will. I loved this game for a long time, too.What I'm not a fan of, is the way things on this have turned recently within STO. The atmosphere of the game is wrong. When I first started playing, it was a happy, very lore-friendly place filed with lots of people trying to get their way into the TV screen we all watched our first episodes on. Recently, the lay of the land has become confusing. To say you have to grind a lot is the understatement of the milenium. EVERYTHING is a grind now, unless you want to pay for it. It has also become increasingly apparent that PWE is searching for money: In-game purchases are fine, but when you give us 3 new ships and 10 new costumes every other week, it gets ridiculous. I think one of the things I have been experiencing serves as a perfect explination. The game only launches on safe mode. In the time that this bug began to now, I count at least 19 new ships that have been added to the game (not including fleet model ships). The new way of grinding is... well, bad. Horrendous. An abomination. A lot of the new grinds require vast sums of dilithium, which is hard to farm for, and is quantity capped at 8000 units a day, which is a penny in the well of what you'll actually need. Now, dilitium is hard to farm for, but guess what PWE sells. Zen. Guess what you can by dilithium for, kiddies. Zen. All in all, this game is very good. I wouldn't have spent so much time on it otherwise, but I'm terrified that this will turn into Guitar Hero. A good game, a great idea, but driven into the ground harder than a Mack truck hitting a freight train because they produced too much new content too fast, and people got sick of it. Also: when you advertise an upgrade to your existing tier 5 ships to make them ""tier 5u"" ships, make them equal to the tier 6 ships. The imbalance is ridiculous. I have top-tier gear on my odyssey (including your $5 upgrade). It can't keep pace with anything on tier 6, and thats not okay.

If cryptic can stop sucking up the players' money for a month or so and genuinely patch the game, this may improve. PvE events are non-existent, the grind is still horrible. The tutorial sticks you with skills and abilities you may not want and doesnt even let you respecialize to your own liking. You have to buy a token which you can obtain without spending actual money, but it'll take weeks of grinding for Dilithium Crystals just to afford it. My overall rating on this bug-ridden distaster is a 2 out of 5. It seems Cryptic has lost its sense of gaming and just dove for the players' wallets.

55270f6d-c16a-43ed-b67d-96595b53afe2,9,"The space combat is great - especially early in the early game before you get a million different skills to put on your hot-bar and some of the game's more fun features like managing your fire arcs and your power are more important. In the late game, due to this being a 7 year old MMO, the feature creep has made it such that these things matter far less than your ship's build and ancillary power-ups. However, you can play all of the game's ample and fun story missions without ever getting into the endgame and if you enjoy crunch, there is a lot of fun to be had in creating an amazing ship build and earning a variety of crew skills, captain skills, reputation, and ship unlocks that take your prowess even further. This is further assisted by an interesting crafting system and fleet mechanics that make getting the ""perfect"" build achievable and fun - until they add a new set of toys to purchase and the process starts again.There is a lot to like about how this game's systems compliment one another and how it provides a great experience for free players while it also gives significant, but not overwhelming, advantage to the game's whales - especially as the more advanced players tend to play in the highest difficulty settings that are aimed at challenging those few players who have achieved ridiculously OP builds.Having said that, the game is aging and it definitely shows in the lackluster visuals and some game design choices that were once acceptable but are less than ideal in modern games (for example, they will often pause gameplay to have characters share dialogue instead of having them talk to you while you play - that makes sense sometimes because not all exposition occurs during action, but this actually happens in the middle of fights sometimes or immediately before or after them. My guess is that it is just an old engine that has events built based only on mission objective order and/or they get too many errors with sound prioritization. Finally, the ground game has always been water garbage and they never managed to fix it. They should have gutted it and replaced the ground game with a shooter because phasers are incredibly powerful in this IP's lore and almost all races should be taken down by one shot -  even with armor once their shields are depleted. Instead, the ground game is just really bad MMO design with a bunch of mechanics that don't really matter. I literally put Netflix on the other screen during ground levels and just pound buttons until I kill things or die. I can pay attention and be more successful, but not enough for it to matter. Still, at this point it is a lesson to learn for the next game - and wouldn't that be lovely. I'd be so excited if they announced they were working on a sequel with a modern game engine, modern game design, and the ground game being completely redesigned as a cover-shooter with frequent puzzles and story. I doubt this will happen though as the game's updates over the years tend to indicate that they are engineer light. ",Thu Dec 23 05:54:15 EET 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024
55270f6d-c16a-43ed-b67d-96595b53afe2,10,"Glad I waited for this to come out on PC to play, as the visuals were one of the games two strongest points IMO.

The other strong point is the combat, which I genuinely enjoyed and which ultimately lead to me complete the game twice. Fighting machines is fun, and I look forward to Forbidden West for this reason alone. I also LOVE the machines. I thought they were very well-designed and I loved reading up on their stats and weaknesses. The first time I encountered a Storm-Bird my heart dropped.

I have to also mentioned the campfire/quick-travel system, which I thought was excellent due to the sheer number of campfires on the map. I also enjoyed hunting collectibles. Normally hunting down these things is my least favorite part of a game, but HZD did a good job of making it fun. Not sure what it was exactly, but being able to buy maps from merchants in-game makes it much more tolerable and the being able to fast-travel basically right next to them helps. Also great that when you're done collecting them you can trade them for actual equipment. 

The story was a bit pretentious and if it weren't for the character Sylens, I woulda' hated every single character. Including Aloy. I don't like being hand-holded through a story and boy does this bitch think out loud. Every two steps I take she'd start mumbling some wishy-washy shit about the story. The writing is kinda cringe, but worse than that is it isn't consistent. I was doing a side mission in the DLC where the main bandit boss-guy was yelling at his grunts that their weakness was why he doesn't pay them a retainer... Just doesn't sound like something that would be said in a post-apocalyptic world in an age of tribes. There are many such examples of this. 

There's also a character named Three-Toe Huadiv... Just stahp. 

Water in the game is so awkward, Aloy can walk on it just to a certain point before dropping completely, and then it takes forever to climb back out of it. It isn't automatic either, and you have to stop swimming to be able to climb back onto shore. Just didn't feel user-friendly, and many times I was attacked by a machine and tossed into the water. It took enough time to get out that on the Ultra Hard difficulty, I'd be dead before it was possible. If I suck, that's fine, but if its cause of a mechanical issue with the game it just ended up being frustrating. 

There's something really terrible about the climbing system as well, as many times instead of walking or jumping onto a rope or a ledge, Aloy ends up jumping to the chasm and dying. Again, if this were a rare thing or something that happened due to my n00biness, that would've been fine. But it just happened way too much and at many points in the main missions it would force me to replay almost 20 whole minutes.

The inventory wasn't a great system either, and halfway through the game I realized it didn't even make a difference. Harvesting parts does nothing outside of trading, and even then there are so few things to trade for. I stopped looting machines very early on in the game, and I just think there was a lot of missed potential there. Meat? Useless, you'd think with the 5 or so different kinds you'd be able to cook yourself some items to use in your quest. Nope, just potions, which even on Ultra Rare are in abundant quantity among bandits and soldiers you kill. 

There's a skill that lets you break down items into the in-game currency, but without a mass-disassemble option it's just too tedious for me to bother. It also REALLY doesn't help that when your inventory is filled, an annoying pop-up appears that blocks off your screen telling you that the Shard Salvager skill lets you break them up. Like, I know game, I have the skill. The mechanic is just fucking useless. (Seriously, devs, have y'all ever played a game in your life? You think a pop-up like this is useful? It shows up during combat sometimes, I kinda need the screen real-estate...) 

All that being said, it's a fun game, and I poured 130 hours into it. It's just nothing special.

While I do continue to play it, it has a few issues that are worth mentioning to anyone considering trying out this game.-Firstly, the game has a decent Star-Trek story continuing after the destruction of Romulus that ocurred in the 2009 Star Trek movie, and takes place in the ""Prime"" (AKA the same timeline as TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT, and now DSC) and not the new movies' ""Kelvin"" timeline (Although it is mentioned and lockbox ships of Kelvin timeline starships are present). -Secondly, once you reach level 50, you're introduced to the end-game, although the max level is 60. The end-game consists of reputation grinding and essentially outfitting your ship and captain to perform better in ground or space combat. This is where one of the problems I mentioned earlier comes in, the only real way to play this game is DPS. There is no ""MMO-Trinity"" style of gameplay, well, on paper there is but not in actuallity. While there are 3 career paths (Tactical - DPS, Science - Control/Healer, Engineer - Tank/Pets), DPS is king, and power-creep is to the point of where one high level ship can destroy several borg tactical cubes and a transwarp gateway in ISA (Infected Space Elite - Space Queued Instance), in about 3-5 minutes, which has only gotten shorter over the years. -Going off of the DPS problem mentioned earlier, the power-creep essentially means that PvP in this game, is dead, and has been dead ever since around 2012. Therefore, if you want to PvP, know that it will be near impossible to find a game, and if you do, you will most likely get hit by a player who uncloaks and alpha-strikes you into oblivion within 3 seconds. -The game isn't ""Pay-To-Win"" per say, it's more ""Pay-To-Get-X-Faster"", as everything, even stuff in the cash shop, can be acquired for free (Through the Dilithium exchange, which allows you to convert Dilithium, a time gated currency you earn, into zen, the premium cash currency, by ""buying"" it from other players who ""sell"" their zen for dilithium). As such, the exchange is player-driven and the price raises/lowers as the need for dilithium grows/wanes (Basically if an event rewards a ton of dilithium, exchange prices go up, if a crafting event or phoenix box run comes, dilithium is needed so the price goes down). However, getting zen this way takes quite a while, and if you don't have more than the basic 3 character slots, with high level characters, then you will grind at an abyssmal rate, although, as a guy that has several characters, it's still a grind, although possible to manage 100 zen per day (most ships cost 2,000-3,000). Even the lockbox ships are available for free as well, as most players sell them on the EC Exchange, with EC being the ""gold"" of the game that you earn fairly easilly. The catch is lockbox ships go for at least 20,000,000 ec (those being the old T5 ships from 4-5 years ago, new ones go for 150,000,000+), and this amount means you'll be grinding ec from either crafting, Tour The Galaxy (Mission that rewards ec daily), or other means, and this method will still take around a month or 2 to earn said ship. -The Canon and Lore, don't even get me started. If you expect to find a ""Canon"" - esque Star Trek game, this is not for you. This is a game where captains of the Federation, Klingon Empire, and New Romulan Republic all fly whatever ship they want, except ships from each other's faction. For example, we can have a human or klingon pilotting a ""salvaged"" Jem-Hadar Dreadnaught, or a ""Captured"" Voth Dreadnaught, or ""Recovered"" Kelvin Timeline Dreadnaught. My point is, the game doesn't really care for being lore-friendly, or canon, outside of the story-missions. Although from a technical standpoint I suppose having so many admiral rank captains running around is also not lore-friendly, but necessary for the whole MMO thing to work, so in some sense, I can understand this.-The game can be fun at times, but at least for me, I get burned out every so often, and leave for a couple months, only to come back later.Ok, so if you don't mind those issues, then you may like this game, if you take issue with grinding, or the Star Trek Canon being somewhat violated, then steer clear from this game, and find another Star Trek game (I'd recommend Stellaris with the New Horizons Mod, or Bridge Commander if you can find it).Oh and if you do decide to play, here are a few tips-Make sure to get the free event ships and stuff, even if you don't fly them, admiralty cards come from them-Join a fleet (guild), they provide access to high-end gear-If you want to make dilithium fast, try going to a battlezone and using admiralty missions-If you want to make EC fast, do tour the galaxy as much as possible with high speed warp cores/engines. Also sell lootbox/lockbox keys on the exchange for EC, they go for 4 mil each at the time of writing thisOther than that, have fun if you decide to stay and play, and if this isn't your cup of tea, there are other star trek games / mods out there, some of which you may find more enjoyable. This game still gets a mixed from me though.",Sun May 09 18:46:18 EEST 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

But just cause after hundreds, if not thousands of hours of gameplay (I never really launched through Steam, so don't look at that) I walked away (cause everything wasn't going my way and my obsession with building a starbase had taken on sickening proportions) doesn't mean it's not a good game.My rule of thumb is generally that if you get at least 1 hour of fun out of a game for every 1 dollar you've spent on it, it's a good game.

From what I've gathered is the Delta Update broke pretty much everything that wasn't broken and made what already was much worse. PVP is dead. Ship balance is all ♥♥♥♥ed up end-game. Before Tier 5 was the best, they were expensive but it made sense for them to be. Tier 6 however, ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. From what I've gathered the pilot spec on a ship with a tank build is broken as all hell in PVP. The game is loosely Pay-to-Win, I say loosely because you go through a process to get zen coins which are needed to buy top tier items, but the process is painfully slow and on a single accout, you'll never see a profit. It takes up two two months across multiple accounts just to make enough Zen to buy a tier 6 ship. Constant lag spikes and random rubber-banding that shows no sign of being fixed anytime soon.Ground combat is awful, hands down one of the worst I've ever seen. Again, no sign's of that changing any time soon. Many of the planets are bland and boring with no point behind being able to go to them. Worst contender is Andoria, outside of what I think is melee PVP, there's nothing there. No Top tier melee shops, no nothing. No one ever goes there. Upgrading your gear seems to make game shops pointless, at least to me. Why waste 5,000 EC on a plasma array when you can make a better one for free?.Upgrading later on can be extremely slow. Only 3% of the game is voiced, which is fine if it wasn't.. All over the place? You could be having a scripted conversation with your First officer, they have a voice that covers the first three lines of the script then the rest of the paragraph has no voice over, it's just odd is all. All that is forgiveable if it wasn't for my last point, THE GAME IS BUSTED!!. For many users the game wont even load up anymore. It's always crashing, can't even get to log-in screen without it crashing, there are no long-term fixes. Re-starting the game only works a few times, after that not even Verifiying files or re-installing the game will fix it. In short, this game was once a great game, then delta came along and ruined it all. If I was in charge, delta would of been a update that revamps ground combat, squash bugs and glitches, offered up more Voice-over and improved PVP.",Sat May 08 11:18:24 EEST 2021,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

Liked:
- The graphics are pure eye candy, while lower res than C1 they look nice and shiny and give great performance across most all systems.
- The gameplay is vastly refined while some say ""simplified"" I find it has more depth and more possibilities for you as a gamer to use and just enjoy.
- The campaign has its highs and lows. The highs can be pretty epic and the lows can be extremely boring. In the middle you have walking, walk from point a to point z, rince wash repeat.

You need to invest hundreds of dollars to PVP.- PVE is a DPS race. You need to invest a lot of time to grind out gear for obscure game breaking exploits.- Ground combat was abandoned. I like it more than space, but I am a huge minority.- NOBODY does stuff via the LFG queue.- The Story is really, really ♥♥♥♥ing good.===I wanted to update this based on a writeup I posted on /r/StarTrek on 2018/01/22:I am one of the biggest haters of this game, having put around 2000 hours and several hundred dollars into the game over 5 years (2012-2016). I will not suggest against playing it, however I will suggest against playing only the story content and leaving it at that.If you treat STO like an MMO you will get burned out. and get throw threw the mud, it will destroy you as a person and you will end up hating yourself for it. The microtransactions in this game are greedy, and the community is a mix between ignorance and apathy when it comes to this.Also, anything negative about sto the game gets vote brigaded by the community. I Have witnessed this first hand on many occasions though the years as all that's left in the community are the most dedicated, most worn players that will lie cheat and deceive you that STO is a land of milk and honey, when all of that milk and honey dried up around the time of Delta Rising - and the players loved it.",Thu Dec 02 16:08:45 EET 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a
a8f71484-bd7a-446b-9f66-895971041207,10,"This game at it's current state is pretty darn good. And I say this because of many reasons like:1. The story is intriguing and it has that little something that keeps you going through it. They reward very good loot(some of them) when you replay them at max level, which is 60. Yes, you can replay almost every episode(missions). New episodes are added regularly. The story captures the feel of the Star Trek universe pretty well.2. The combat is good at the start, but it can get boring if you don't have a good build. There are many builds out there and there is one for you for sure. Ground combat is not the best, but not the worst either. IMPORTANT!  The game relies on DPS a lot. It is possible to be a healer/tank, but you won't influence the battles that much.3. The game is massive. Sector Space is huge with a lot of Systems including Sol System, Qo'Nos, DS9, Drozana Station and the new Delta Quadrant is awesome. There are tons of things to do in the game, from crafting to grinding Energy Credits(in-game currency) to building your Fleet Space Station and other Fleet buildings. 4. One of the best things with this game is that you can get Zen(the most important currency) in two ways:a. Buy Zen with money. ORb. Grind Dilithium, which is made from quite a lot of activities in-game. There is a Dilithium exchange market controlled entirely by players like a stock market or a bank. You buy Zen for Dilithium or vice-versa. That makes Dilithium a very important currency. You are capped at making 8.000 dilithium per day per character though. But you can make other characters and transfer the dilithium to the character you want. Zen is the only currency account-wide.",Sun Jan 02 10:31:36 EET 2022,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

Just facing down one keldon (if you ever happen to find one) on elite difficulty is a tough battle for any engineer in a normal cruiser. AI (npc) ships are or were capable of doing anything a player ship can do, aside from cloaking, pathing used to be enemy ships moving in a straight line only firing back at players in the line of fire arcs, now enemies react follow, even boost and use abilities they never used before. Enemies are not fitted with better equipment, but hopefully one day they will be.Ground npcs are still mostly the same, there were always pathing issues in ground instances where corridors are involved, so making them able to do whatever they want would cause even more chaos. Basically npcs on the ground instances can do things a player can't do, like fit through impossibly tight gaps between a door and blocking shield eventually.The visuals on the game can be adjusted to suit almost every gaming computer on the planet!! those with lower end can turn down shadows and particle settings and turn all other things up to get the most beauty out of the game, those with high end systems can simply turn up everything and see the heavens during a full warzone, good luck with your random crash depending on how it goes ^^i recommend this to anyone looking for npc's that are not completely locked down by code, they have more free will than defiance and firefall npcs put together.please do list any other games apart from champions online that have unlocked AI if anyone replies to this. :)oh and i mention champions online only because npcs in the game have full amazing control of their actions when they are broken.the future is superior",Thu Mar 25 21:58:44 EET 2021,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

There are some bugs, and that could be just to it being a bit of an older game (as well as the PC port maybe not being as optimized as it could be), but I found that for the most part it didn't affect my gameplay experience. The one thing that did was how animations were hardly smooth, and dialogue segments (where you talk to other characters and get to choose your response) are really choppy and feel awkward. If there was one thing I hope they will improve in the second game (as this one clearly has set up for a sequel) is that they improve the min cut scenes when you interact with characters in dialogue (think Mass Effect). There were times where, due to the outfit I was wearing, the over the shoulder shots of other characters talking were blocked by the headdress.

The Klingon Empire, only has about 30.  And the Romulans, have only like 15.

As a fan, Star Trek Online is a trekkie's wet dream come true. The creators have gone through great lengths to honor the Star Trek franchise. Each mission feels like you're playing a tv episode! Fans will notice throughout the game plenty of references to all the various television series as well as many well-known characters like Worf, Spock, etc. Lots of the voice acting done in the game is supported by many of the actors that played various characters throughout Star Trek, so you know this game is legit. For those who aren't exactly Star Trek fans, you'll most likely see this is simply a themed MMO with a typical MMO experience. Plenty of grinding, reputations, and raids which come in the form of ""STFs"". Although there are plenty of quests and things to do, if one gets bored, there's always one of the more under-utlized features: the Foundry. This is a place where players submit custom-made quests for others to play. That's right, user-created missions! This is what I love most about STO.

Essentially, be prepaired to pay real money at the higher levels, and don't buy anyhting less than a T6 ship because it's a waste of money - and in the future expect to pay again, and again as they release increasingly high-level content and your current ship won't be able to do it.---original first impressions-----TL;DR: It's FREE, so give it a go if you're even slightly into Trek. IT's surprisingly good, and the paid for store items are good value for what you get. one of the better PVE MMO's I've ever played.(52 hours played at this point)  I was immediately surprised by how much detail the game makers have gone into in terms of creating a very 'Star Trek' feel to the game, and successfully translating a TV/Film franchise to not only a computer game, but a (relatively) free-roaming MMO.All the Trek bits aside, the game itself plays nicely, the interface on the ground I found a tiny bit clunky, but I adapted fairly quicky and there's certainly a lot of scope for customisation and individual play styles. The ground game reminds me a lot of a party-rpg style game because you have your away team of NPC crew members, all of whom have skills and equipment that you can customise and level up, so it's mostly about creating a 'team' that works well rather than just making one character that can do everything.The space combat is where the game shines in many ways. It's a healthy mix of tactical positioning and phaser-blasting, and the control system is nicely done. Combat is well paced and feels solid, though there are other things to do in space other than shoot stuff.The mission system is robust and fairly varied, with good stories and they feel very much like episodes in a TV series for the most part. There's a lot of repeatable missions and side missions as you'd expect from a MMO. There's a welcome mix of mini-games and small puzzle-solving elements to many of the missions which add some variety.The game is still being actively developed with expansions and content, there seems to be events very frequently that get you bonuses or involve special storylines, the community is active and the players seem on the whole a good bunch of people.My major complaint is that it's too easy (even on the hardest setting). I'm not a power gamer and I wouldn't consider myself to be any sort of expert or anything, but it's basically impossible to fail any mission. There's no way that I've found of losing anything, there's no possiblity of any of your main bridge crew dying, your ship can never be destroyed. If you get 'killed' or blown up on a mission you just repawn (the mission doesn't even reset to the start).The up-sde of this is that it actually adds to the feeling of Trek universe (where there's always a way out even when crew seemingly dies, etc.).So that's it really.-----end original------Latest feeling:Generally, what I said still stands. However there are some important considerations to make. The PVE space game gets less tactical as you get higher up and as usual the DPS-heavy options are infinitely better than any other play-style. Which is sad since at lower levels there's quite a lot of tactics involved and it's viable playing other roles. At lv50+ it's just ""activate all the special abilities and keep firing"", I spend more time watching the cooldown timers on my hotbar than I do the actual 'ships-in-space' bit. Ironically the ground-game has levelled perfectly and remained consitent throughout.The game ***IS*** Pay-to-win. Up to lv50 you can do fine on the 'free' version, although I did make some (very optional and fun) purchases from the C-store because I wanted to support a game I enjoyed. I purchased a couple of ships and a few other things, spending around £40 or so - for me, the purchase price of a good game. My plan was to make a small (£5-£10)purchase every month or so as I played or les frequent larger ones (the subscription options don't offer much IMO, but there's plenty you can buy).When I hit lv51 I found my ship (which cost me £25+ which I was using since I didn't like the equivalent-in-power free ones) suddenly struggling. It seems to me that to play in a comfortable way after lv50 you really need to pay for a Tier 6 ship - therefore it's pay-to-win since you can't realistically do all the content avaialble without paying.I'm OK with this model, except for one fact. I've already purchased three ships at this point, unfortunately they are all now essentially useless since the content auto-levells with you. One (a Tier 5) did have the option to upgrade ""to bring it up to standard at lv50+"". Which I did using a paid-for upgrade kit, making it not a T6, but a T5U. We were told that this was as close to a T6 as this ship class could get.7 days later...They have just released the same ship class with a slight stat boost and a new skin as a T6 ship. Unfortunately to use it I have pay full price for it - despite it being 95% identical to a ship I've already puprchased (it's even advertised as being the T6 version of the ship). Because of the nature of the game my existing ship (the T5U) version will be useless and honeslty I'll just delete it from my ship hangar. I would feel much better if they offered an upgrade from T5, or T5U to T6 rather than making me pay full price again. I'm not alone (according to the forums) in feeling slightly cheated/misinformed by this. It seems like this is the plan for new ships, so essentially, just be aware that when you play this game, you'll be expected to pay (between about £7 at lower levels and £35 for highest levels) for ships, and that realistically you need to buy at least one or more at the top levels to play, in addition to any vanity purchases or optional choices you make. Again, not necessarily a critisism of the game or the pay model, but a definite criticism of the communications between the company developing the game and the players regarding real-money-investments. Knowing what I do now, I would not waste my money buying any 'lower' class ship, since they are useless, and I would have just waited until now and spent that money on a T6 instead.",Fri Sep 11 06:36:33 EEST 2020,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

The ship desings and mechanics are sound, They're fun to play for a few hours every now and then, but by god dont get me started on the ground combat.

In the begining, it was fun, with the 2 main segments, Ground and Starship, allowing for the game to change what you do, so as to not get bored. But after this initial euphoria, I sadly have to admit, the game is mind-numbingly boring. Every mission has the same basic structure; Warp in, alternate between space and ground combat, then warp out again. It becomes a grind during the mid-game, and dispite attempts to make you solve puzzles or resolve issues, it becomes a mashing ""F"" contest, as you don't have to do anything other than that 99% of the time. On the rare occasion a genuine puzzle comes along, its solution is either highlighted in a text box, or told to you when you begin. And then the cash-grabbery. I would overlook moderate cash-grabbing in a F2P game; servers are not free, but the preposterous extent of the cash-grabbing in this game is unforgivable. You are capped at 10.000.000 Credits, unless you buy an upgrade. This would be fine, were it not for the fact that the majority of good late-game equipment costs much more than this. The vast majority of ships are locked behind their own paywalls, as are the more iconic outfits, such as the TOS uniforms, just to ring every possible penny out of the playerbase. However, worst of all is that the best, endgame ships are in lockboxes, which you have to buy keys for. But with these ships having an ~0.4% droprate from these crates, to get them you must either waste far too much money, or be very lucky. This guts the endgame, as if you dont pay into the system, you become obselete. Even at endgame the missions are boring and repetitive. Don't play this alone, get a friend who owes you a favour to go through it with you. Its comunity made missions can be fun, but the creator for theses missions is difficult at best.

b0992ab9-a3fb-4655-9c5b-209013146e68,3,"Early Access ReviewI very STRONGY advise you to stay away from Paladins. You will understand why by reading this review.I'll start with the pros, to give you an idea of why i chose to play this game (non-steam client) for more than a thousand hours. I've started a bit before Mal Damba was released, and seen a quantity of the many aspects this game took.Pros+ The game, at it's core, is fun. Visual feedback is great, and certain champions are incredibly fun to play (Mal Damba! But also kinessa, lian, etc.)+ Lively game (for the moment!) so matchmaking often takes almost no time.+ Currently no pay 2 win mechanics+ Great art direction especially on the environment. Coherent and really readable visuals (I insist on its readability. It really ticks, unlike a certain game it is rather... inspired from). Some really great character designs (but some others being terrible in equal measure).+ Grohk the blue orc.Cons- Clearly one of the worst game balances I've ever seen. A few top tier champions are always picked, so much that a good third of the champion cast are never present. As I am writing this review the game is in OB67, and ranked matches are grounds for only the same faces all the time: Makoa/Moji/Talus permaban in almost all ranks, and every match having Seris, Inara, Zhin, Tyra, Ash, Fernando, BK, Lian, Lex and Jenos. Casuals are even worse since there are no bans and the triad of doom is always taken, ending up in very frustrating, imbalanced matches.- Generally very bad design decisions. The game is constantly fighting against itself and every countermeasure introduced to fix a problem becomes another, bigger problem by itself. Healers are too strong? Buff Cauterize (healing reduction on hit item, buyable in-match) to 90% at a cheap lvl3. 90% yes, and it is the same for Resilience (CC reduction) which is one of the cheapest items in the game. Bam, almost full invulnerability to cc's, giving cc-reliant champions a very hard time even surviving, and dumbing down lategame to a brainless shootfest without strategy.Combine very small maps with low respawn times and mounts, and you have a game that is very hostile to flanking and doesn't leave breathing room if you pull off multiple kills by yourself as a damage/flanker, also adding to the frustration because whenever you flank you have a very high chance of being suddenly ambushed by a newly respawned opponent without having enough time to react to their sudden apparition, gotta watch these respawn timers closely :^). How did they ""fix"" this? By making flankers unbearably strong against their supposed targets, and thus extremely difficult to balance (one single fix can make a champion useless, cf Skye, or completely broken, cf Talus.)Patch after patch, they also continually lowered the skill floor for champions by enlarging the size and raising the speed of projectiles by absurd amounts (what would have been a typical quake 3 rocket launcher speed on evie's staff for instance, has simply become an instant-hit from a reasonable distance. This has been the case for all projectile-based champions).They also introduced auto-aim skills on certain characters, lowering the skill requirements even further. While I don't mind accessibility, constant decisions like these make the game especially frustrating, as many shots are simply unavoidable (moji flames, bk royal subjects explosions, zhin/maeve/evie/ash/willo shots, drogoz spitspam,...) without using skills that grant iframes (which not everyone has) even between the hands of novice or very bad players.All this leads to a meta where the only thing that really works is a 2tanks team with a very strong healer with great survivability (seris/jenos), an unkillable flank (talus/zhin) and a tank wrecker (tyra/bk). No room for creativity, or you get utterly destroyed simply because the opponent had a better composition.Paladins also inherits from the bad aspects MOBAs have, as in, if you perform badly, your whole team will suffer. And the chances to lose just because of one single player not doing their job are immense. This, also, is very frustrating (and actually the reason why I am rewriting this review: Just went out of a losing streak of 6 matches, in which I performed unusually well, but lost because of another mute, illiterate player ego-picking a damage champion (thus forcing a teammate to play something they are bad at), and then flanking alone to evidently die.)- HiRez has a history of constantly disrespecting their playerbase if not even showing contempt to them, by not listening to player feedback, introducing pay2win mechanics destroying the whole game (infamous OB64 patch from which, hopefully, they backpedaled. Dig the controversy around this patch if you want a good laugh, or to facepalm yourself through the ground), exploiting early access state to excuse an unstable client, game-breaking bugs and performance issues, which they left as-is up until now. If you need more evidence look at what happened with Tribes: Ascend, Global Agenda and Smite.Paladins has been in Open Beta since around... 4 years now? Yes, 4 years of beta.- Easy Anti Cheat. This should be a huge red flag. Their client also installs two almost useless but mandatory bloatware services on your machine (hipatchservice). If you are concerned about privacy, be prepared for a proctology exam.- As much as I hate using this term there is no other way around this time: the community is insanely toxic (LoL/Dota2/csgo levels of cancer). Diamond players are the worst offenders in general. In parallel, a ♥♥♥♥♥on of ragequitters (even in ranked, doing this on purpose to ruin their comrades' ladder climbing) and cheaters (teleporting payload, mounting mid-fight with infinite CDs, aimbotting, wallhacking, you name it).Reports don't seem to work also, and the penalty for leaving a match is a joke.- Insanely bad matchmaking. In ranked you'll often see silver/gold players being matched up against diamonds, lots of people with ranks they are not supposed to have (diamonds playing like total newbies, and gold players that play superbly well). There are also rumors of matchmaking forcing players who paid for skins against much worse players, preferably free2play.From a gamedev standpoint, they have awesome artists, contributors and dev staff, whose work is being ruined by the greedy, unethical mentality and business practices applied by HiRez's higher ups.That's all I can think of right now. If you're still not convinced (you masochist :p), try it out by yourself since it is free. Just please do not give them your money, they do not deserve it as they are currently.",Sun Dec 19 18:40:02 EET 2021,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

Then suddenly Queue times in OCE stop working alltogether overnight, and queue times during the day instead of taking 10-30 seconds you can wait for upwards of 5 minutes EASY every game. CAN WE NOT? Splitting the playerbase is killing smaller regions, and we aint even that small but your queue times have more than quadrupled. The matches you DO get are full of complete saltiness instead of the prior mild salt, probably due to long term players being unhappy with the state of the game. The future looks like you want to head into pay to win, and you guys at Hi-rez know how quickly two of your games died out after you patched for pay to win schemes. Those patches were pretty much the heat death of your universe in that game, and you obliterated your player bases. This gunna be the 3rd or you gunna listen to community feedback and FIX IT.The game ontop of that, is further pushing people into playing their mains because thats what they have all their cards for further decreasing the amount of support players and frontlines because half of your playerbase are angry 12 year olds who all want to play DPS and expect the next person to hold the torch.All bar ONE thing you said the OB64 was brought here for, is actually doing and will continue to do the exact opposite you hoped for.

e672a938-58a8-4756-8eb8-c73c655f9922,8,"Early Access ReviewThis rant is regarding OB64 and all of the problems it introduced such as the new card system. If by chance they scrap this system entirely in future updates, this review may not be as relevant.OB64 is here and Hi-Rez continues to disappoint with what I think is actually the worst update Paladins has ever seen. The card system is complete trash and pay to win for casuals (most people play casual/quickplay). Getting your cards to their max level takes so many duplicates and chests that even players who spend hundreds of hours on the game will have a very hard time doing it. On top of that, the game's balance was destroyed even further with new broken legendary cards (Makoas new legendary, Kinessa's new legendary) and broken loadout cards. New Players will have a much more difficult time now than ever before against players that spend some money or those that have played for a while. Another variable will be introduced to matches outside of individual skill level, strategy or teamwork, and it’s not one that needed to be there. Your “wallet” size shouldn’t determine the outcome of a match, but it’s something you will see in quickplay/casual. With that being said, Paladins now feels even more broken, buggy and unbalanced with horrible design decisions to loadout cards and lack of testing. It baffles me that so many bugs and problems get through when new patches (and this update in particular) are implemented. It’s a complete mess to say the least. It’s unfortunate, I really do like Paladins (at least I did before OB64) but Hi-Rez can't be trusted to make sound decisions based on what the community wants. I understand that an audience may not always know what it/they want, but there is no way that Hi-Rez didn't see the backlash and skepticism people had about this update weeks before it was released. On top of that, Hi-Rez’s only concern seems to be sh*tting out new costumes and cosmetics rather than fix their own game. Their management clearly doesn’t have their priorities straight. With all that said, this update will definitely hurt Paladins more than it will help it. It does so much wrong and it seems like a slap in the face to their players. I will not whine or complain any longer though, as that doesn’t seem to be effective at all. If Hi-Rez ever learns from their mistakes, it will be when their player base completely dies off. As a long time player of Paladins, I am going on a “hiatus” from this game until at least some of these problems I listed are properly addressed in future updates. If that means that Hi-Rez never fixes these problems, then I see no reason to continue playing. Anybody reading this who feels the same should also DO the same. Actions speak louder than words, and nothing grabs the attention of a company more than losing their consumers. No consumers, no money, and in turn, no company.

Changing it from ""get a card through RNG/buy it directly"" to ""a get the same card through RNG a billion times to level it up to a decent level"". Also the difference between a level 1 and a level 5 card is massive(like lvl.1 is useless and lvl.5 lets you kill anyone with a single click). It basically forces you to pay your way to victory(as of writting this it costs around 2500-3500 dolars to unlock everything). THESE ARE NOT COSMETICS BUT GAME CHANGING ITEMS GIVING SOMETIMES OVER 100% DAMAGE BOOSTS!And on top of that Hi-rez has been ignoring a ton of bugs, poor matchmaking and glaring balance issues. But instead of addressing any of them the roll out this pay to win system(basically the same as Battlefront 2 by EA).

ae4958e9-d63a-44c1-9618-99e97d1513f4,6,"Early Access ReviewThey finally seperated team death match from onslaught but sadly there's literally only 3 team death match maps to play. Why did you guys remove the previous maps? It gets very repetiive way too soon. And now the main problem I see is aimbotters playing this game.3/10Still a shi.tty game. After the most recent updates they have done nothing to fix the problems mentioned below. Instead they remove more from the game and made the characters way to expensive to even want to grind for gold now. They got rid of their battle royale mode and still haven't seperated the TDM mode from the Onslaught mode. And I'm not alone... the 3 other people I played this with already stopped because of what these stupid developers did to the game.These as.swipes at Hi-Rez reset my ""daily login bonus"" from 11+ days to 0 as well as the ""Champion Quest"" where you need to complete 40 daily quests to get a purple chest. So now both of those are on 0 and here I am wondering why? Apparently they did the same thing to my friend so I don't recommend this game. It doesn't seem worth the effort... (Apparently after googling it... it turns out it's a known bug that's never been fixed. Go figure. I've already encountered several bugs now with this launcher even though this is supposed to be a ""beta"" and it's been out for years now... Also like I said a lot of these bugs are known/reported and never fixed for years. Seems to me the dev's just don't care and use the game as a cash grab off the morons that pay to play it.)I'm sick of queuing up for ""Team death match"" and being put in a fu.cking ""Onslaught"" game. And the game is clearly unbalanced where some champions just dominate an entire team solo. I do not recommend playing it at all. The dev's don't know how to balance s.hit and with their patches they just ruin the game more and more. I'm at the point where I'm ready to uninstall this piece of s.hit and hope the company goes bankrupt as well.At first it may seem fun but the more you play it the less likely you'll like it. The balancing issues, horrible matchmaking, long queue timers as well as in game timers, try hards, afks, noobs on your team, the grind for card/account/character leveling, laggers, no ping cap limit/region locking, perma stuns/crowd control effects, perma ""reveal"" trash where people know where you're at 24/7, daily gold cap limit, daily champion chest limit, slow leveling, etc seriously take their toll on the gaming experience. This game could have been amazing but as of right now it's trash in my opinion. There's too much wrong with it which you'll find out for yourself if you try it out.Old Review:6/10Yes and no...I only recommend it if you're playing with ""friends"" and have your own party going where there's actually real teamwork going on/communication. Then it's a lot of fun aside from the few retar.ds you may be paired up with on your team. If you're not playing with friends then good luck... you'll have 0 team work going on and most of the time people just feeding and playing the game like it's a Call of Duty shooter.Over all it's seemed like a decent game but as I mentioned before be prepared to grind those card levels up, have afks on your team, feeders, hardcore noobs that don't know what they're doing, being put up against try hards, a lame daily gold cap limit (free currency), daily limit of 5 free chests (so the grind is real), long queue times (worse when retar.ds don't click ready), long starting times because laggers joining the wrong servers, long starting game times because of too many different timers they have implemented for choosing different c.rap, horrible in game chat menu/commands, and the launcher is pretty buggy (where some of these bugs have been reported 2 years + ago and still not fixed). The launcher sure is bugged. When ever I minimize or use the steam overlay (Shift + Tab) the game gets all bugged where my cursor dissapears.The more I play it the less I like it. I thought the whole ""unbalanced"" thing was a joke. But after playing it longer and longer you can see how badly the game needs to be balanced. When healer classes are out doing damage classes in damage then something is wrong. That explains why people always play the same op usual characters. And playing solo is generally no fun in this game at all. Also the matchmaking is bad where sometimes you have a 0 chance of winning against the try hards that have all their cards maxed out and only play the most op characters. It makes the game really boring and at times I feel like I'm ready to hit that ""uninstall"" button.After this recent update (2/21/18 patch) they got rid of my favorite mode ""team death match."" Apparently they merged the team death match queue with the onslaught queue. Why the f.uck would you do that? And the new battlegrounds mode just feels so empty/boring. I don't want to play no f.ucking ""king of the hill"" (onslaught) s.hit when I dont give a fu.ck about holding a point. So now when I queue up for ""Death Match"" (the only mode similiar to team death match) it puts me in other retar.ded game modes I don't want to play. Hi-rez sure has some retar.ded developers that don't know what they're doing. It didn't even help with the queue times either instead it's taking twice as long or longer to get into a game now. This game is defintely going downhill. It's starting to look more and more like a mobile game where it's a hardcore grind and microtransactions determine whether or not you have fun. I guess this explains why it's definitely not as popular as it once was several years ago...",Sat May 09 16:40:57 EEST 2020,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

It has amazing graphics and physics (In Black Ops the only thing you could do that involves physics is shoot a bottle from the table. You can't even compare that to this amazing game). You have so many different ways to fight your enemy (or even sneak past them all together in stealth mode) and the AI is very smart aswell. The Multiplayer is way better than the one of Black Ops in my opinion since it simply has the nanosuit. You have to take care of multiple things at once. Your nanosuit's energy, the people you are facing and the objective you have to execute. My favourite gamemode would be ""Assault"" it's basicly like Call of Duty's Search and Destroy (round based) but with hacking terminals.

ae4958e9-d63a-44c1-9618-99e97d1513f4,2,"Early Access ReviewMany people try to stick to the idea that this is an Overwatch clone. Yes, this borrows many things, even character inspiration from Overwatch, but that is just about where it ends. I have spent about 300~ hours on Overwatch. I have dont it all from casual to ranked, dicking around in some of the terrible brawls. While Overwatch is a well polished game, it just does not compare to Paladins at all. I would firstly like to talk about the whole ""ripoff"" aspect people seem to take on when looking at this game. Overwatch did not invent most of the content in their game, they borrowed a lot from other games. What is a game but a collaboration of other ideas taken from others?Not every game is unique. You will find in almost every genre, in almost every title, they borrow a majority of elements from other games and put their own spin on it. This is exactly what Paladins has done here. This game is in depth character building via the card system and distrubuting points among 5 different cards, which you can pick from a pool of 16 different cards. It is not the same 16 cards for every character, they all have 16 DIFFERENT cards especially made for that character only. With 17 characters at the time of this writing, that is 272 different cards, that can not only be assigned to a hero, but leveled up with the 12 points given to boost their effects even further. Neat!Then, while in game, similar to how you gained ""fire"" on Overwatch, you gain credits instead. These credits can be used to purchase temporary buffs in game that only last until that one game ends, and can also be upgraded into 3 different tiers further boosting their effects. You can change up the buffs you buy every game depending on the enemy team to help further counter their character choice. Do they have Skye (stealth character)? Buy illuminate to help see he cloaked at a longer range, and upgrade that to extend the range, making it much harder to sneak up and get easy kills. The list goes on, that is just a very minor example.The game modes right now are just your basic payload/siege (siege is capture a point, then push payload). I am sure they have more modes in the work, this game is in beta after all. While on the subject of beta, you may be first turned away by the unpolished visuals/maps/audio. I was even turned off by it at first, but the more I played the more it grew on me and I could see that this game has a long way to go. In its current state, this is by far one of the most enjoyable FPS I have played in a long time.So my advice to you: do not come into this expecting Overwatch. That would be like loading up Call of Duty and expecting Counter Strike. Look past the hate and treat yourself to this.

c9a59f9b-8830-489c-ad29-e12d3e460e9e,0,"TL;DR:As a TF2 and Overwatch fanatic, I definetely recommend this game to any fans of the MOBA or FPS genreSo in order to review this properly I must give some context.I've been a TF2 fanatic since 2009. I loved Overwatch to death for a year or 2 before the Loot Box grind became far too much for me. So yeah, I was kinda an OW fanatic too, thus instantly hating on the look of Paladins and refusing to try it (same with Smite when I played a lot of DOTA 2 and LoL, but I DID try that game and it wasn't my style at all).After the Dark Tides update, I decided to give it a try. After all, TF2 grew slightly stale with no content updates, and OW just doesn't nearly have the spark it once had. I tried it despite all the complaints, being too unbalanced and too ""pay 2 win""Honestly, this game is pretty damn fun. It's not perfect, it's not even the greatest, but the amount of detail, heart and soul put into the characters and skins. As I've witnessed, Hi-Rez is notorious for leaving games in the dust in search of a new trend. However, they seem to be, even though moving towards trends, aren't leaving Paladins in the dust.Pros:-Movement feels smooth and fine (until you hit a wall, which stops you for some dumb reason)-The characters are cute and likeable, albeit a little basic (at least it doesn't have the pretensiousness of OW's writing)-Its world and design is super fun to look at. I like how it really bends the whole ""gun slinging + fantasy"" style that it has going on-A lot of the game is focussed on it being FUN. Not necessarily being ""the best"" or ""the most complicated"". It seems to focus on an aspect that you're just having a good time.-It has this really nice mix between a MOBA and a FPS. Overwatch leans very heavily in the FPS range much more so than a FPS+MOBA should.-No longer has pay-to-win elements with the cards. Im a huge Battlerite fan and I love the Card system it has that gives life to the game-A lot of the Champs have pretty cool and original designs, even if some are directly based off Overwatch or TF2 champs.-IS THAT GRANT GOODEVE VOICING THE TF2 ENGINEER SKIN FOR BARIK?!?! Even if not, it's hella convincing and I love it.-It's minor but I noticed a lot of effort put into the 3rd Person models for most of the characters. Only Roadhog from Overwatch has an interesting move pace in his actual model since most of it was only focussed for FPS. I like how Paladins pays attention to detail in both aspects.-The way it deals with new skins is actually pretty interesting and much more fair compared to OW. It has a semi-direct-to-purchase method which lets you get some high quality skins, Vault Keys granting you an old and exclusive item set is also a nice touch!Cons:-Balancing seems to be a mess. Champs like Ruckus, Drogoz (who I played the most before reviewing), Lex and Tyras seeming to deal a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of damage with hardly any real counters. Ruckus having a massive shield boost, Drogoz having an abundance of health and an easy escape, and Lex and Tyras doing such an incredible amount of damage in just a few shots.-Hitting a wall stops you instantly. In most other games, you can move sideways or forwards without a 1 second stop. It's a minor issue but when it happens, it's incredibly frusturating and ruins the movement. Especially when you're trying to quickly escape a risky situation-Chests and loot are a complete maze to get through and understand. I know that TF2 has this exact issue, but TF2 has strange weapons, most of which have little-to-no value on the community, especially as far as any new player is concerned. In Paladins: Want the skin? Well let's look at the 50 billion chests that are in the store, all of which are $5 each. Good luck getting a skin you want!                  (BUT HONESTLY, it's a Free to Play game, so this doesn't make too much of a big deal.)For now, Paladins is a blast to play in. Will it be after a couple hundred hours? Who knows? Maybe I'll get too frusturated and end up leaving. But honestly, the characters, art style and its smooth and fun environment are too good to leave behind willy nilly.

Overwatch's flaw truly show where this game shines in comparison. This game, while lacking the polish of Overwatch, is vastly more engaging and fun. The world is edgier and has a riskier element to it Blizzard can't pull off. People might say some elements are similar to OW, but I concur. There are so many interesting original champions in this game, that require a lot more skill than those in Overwatch. Each character can be played in multiple ways, and their skill ceilings feel higher. The healers are actually fun to play in this game, with Ying and Mal'Damba being super interesting to play and play against. Overwatch constains you severely on how you can play.

bf98dcae-dbcf-4bcb-90f3-cc54e3410f6f,5,"you're looking at this game thinking ""Oh huh, an Overwatch knockoff"", I strongly advise not letting that idea convince you not to try this game. While there undoubtedly similarities (and even direct inspirations) to many of the Overwatch heroes, this game is pretty different when you get down to the technical side of things.The way I see it, this game is a more approachable game than Overwatch. Not only that, but the Ability selections, Loadout cards and in-game credit shop allow for a more customizable experience in terms of finding characters and playstyles you enjoy. Want more sustain? Equipt health and healing oriented cards. Want an ability more readily available? Equipt cooldown reduction cards. The cards are often low percentages, but you can invest points in a card that you like and increase the impact it has.On top of this, gamemodes are manually chosen and queued for, so you aren't forced to play a mode that you don't particularly enjoy. The option to swap between first and third person on the fly is also a nice touch.That being said, if you were looking to play the Ranked draft mode, I strongly recommend you stay away from it. Currently, the results of your placements can toss you anywhere between Bronze and Diamond, just based on your win/loss rate and the rank of the players you win/lose against. Even once you have placed, you will gain/lose points based on your win/loss ratio. With no consideration for personal performance, you are looking at a system that will punish you the second you go on a losing streak.All in all, if you are looking for a fun, MOBA-style shooter to play casually with friends, I strongly recommend you give this game a try. Just stay away from Ranked for the time being.",Sat Aug 01 05:24:38 EEST 2020,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

Well personally I do play both and I would say I enjoy paladins a bit more latelyI played paladins for a bit when it first launched, tbh I didn't like it that much back then since it was full of bugs and lack of servers. But recently I gave it a try again and now I'm absolutely obsessed with it. (The fact that I bought the founder's pack...)I came back and I am really surprised by how much effort the developers are putting into the game. The game is now so much more optimized, haven't encounter any major bugs so far. Another aspect is the diversity and the amount of champions, they really amused me.

No pay to win model, diverse characters and nice ways to optimise your character via load outs (small skill boost deck).The amount of free content is impressive. A handful of heroes are available from the start and others can be unlocked via ingame gold which is earned by simply playing the game. The cash part is only for those that really like cosmetics or gamers with less patience.The gameplay is smooth, each character plays differently. Some heal or have great mobility via fly or teleport, others use shields and swallow loads of damage and some just apply raw damage. Winning depends on the team effort not the individual effort.The diversity of playgrounds is lacking, this game needs double the amount of arenas to stay interesting in the long run. And often you get kills while actually missing, so that needs optimisation. Cant say anything about ranked play, its locked until you got a whole bunch of champions on lvl 5.

Hes a tank, he moves slowly, and has one ranged attack with a cool down. Now from my experience playing af Fernando, hes weak af, I mean, there are some charecters who moves away at the damn speed of light compared to Fernando. So like, these speedygonzaled charecters jump in your face and take a good amount of your HP, and you deal a great bit of damage on them, but here is the issue, they run away, and all you can do is shoot a fairly weak fireball at them and hope they die? Now lets just assume that fireball misses or whatever, doesnt really matter, but then another one of these fast charecters jump in your face and finishies you off? idk, this really feels unfair, Im playing as a tank, 2 light charecters shouldnt be able to just kill me like that without me having much of a chance of ""getting revenge"" or just getting a kill.TL;DR The fireball attack Fernando has is weak as hell (in my experience), and I suggest you maybe get like a 3 shots or somthing with it before it starts a cooldown.Besides that this game is pretty cool, and you should check it out if you havnt.",Thu Jul 08 23:58:41 EEST 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

c8f3fb79-86d8-4b0d-8f13-1bb5f15a09b8,8,"Early Access Reviewtl,dr: Yes, give it a try.----The fact that the glut of negative reviews come from Overwatch fans angry that their game got ""ripped off"" should tell you a lot about this game. Fun fact: Not only has this game been playable for like a year and in development for probably twice that but you are an idiot if perceived copying is your main argument about the quality of a product (especially when you come out in defense of Blizzard).Pros: - Gameplay is solid, with a lot of different weapons and character skills. Depending on your character you will find everything from assault rifles to shotguns, bows, wands that fire rocket-launcher style projectiles and more; all with a few quirks and character abilities that aid you towards different playstyles.-Fast and entertaining matches. You will seldom have any downtime before you get back into the action and the game is reasonably balanced in attacker vs defender.- Gameplay customization. An interesting card system that lets you specialize your character even more or go in completely different directions, providing bonuses to specific skills or in certain situations. Cards must be acquired with ingame currency so there's no buying your way to the top with real money.- Expanding on the above: very sensible payment model. Champions, a fair amount of skins and cards can all be purchased with ingame currency. Daily log in bonuses can award you a handful of premium currency as well so it's not a stretch to say even the odd premium skin can be acquired for free.Cons:- Sound and art design are a bit weak. Weapons ARE powerful but a lot of the time they don't really sound like it. Mundane character design might be a turn off for some even if nowhere near the worst in genre.- Maps can often be labyrinthine for little reason. Defense and attack can be complicated when there's 5 venues of approach.- Any player's first few matches will be exclusively against bots and in what seems to be only one map. This is not mentioned anywhere (although it's fairly obvious) and might dissuade some players.- The grind for ingame currency can be laborious if you want to unlock a lot of skins and cards.",Wed Mar 10 17:49:19 EET 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

But now that the game is a year old Hi-Rez, in their common fashion, is trying to kill it just like they did with Tribes. This decline started when the essense currency was released. Paladins already had 2 currencies, so adding a third was just unneeded and added more grind. Then Hi Rez started nerfing mobility in almost every champ. Then they decided to add Vivian, who not only is horrifically broken, but also boring and poorly designed. The most recent issue is the new patch OB64. This patch pretty much makes the player have to grind for chests and duplicates to get better at the game. Yup giving an in game advantage to players who have good luck, and money. Amazing. Lets also not forget how instead of fixing the thousands of bugs and issues with the game, HiRez insteads just continuously adding unwanted champs, systems (Cards Unbound), and more bugs with this content. If I were reviewing Paladins on release, I would 100% recommend it for anyone. But now HiRez are making the game worse with every patch. From P2W systems, and unbalanced garbage.

7b8a73b3-1470-40bd-81ba-7e7c69f4b02d,10,"a lot of people say that paladins is just a cheap version of overwatch it kinda is but not really. You've probably seen thousands of videos explaining why its different but im here to tell a story. The first time i installed paladins i was amazed to how much this game is like overwatch but not as polished, but only when i got overwatch i realised that the two games are completly different overwatch is more toxic and has a lot of salt in it while paladins doesn't have that at least not that much as overwatch. Of course there are some things that I'd like to be in paladins that are in overwatch like herochanging but that would take away the fun and experience you get when playing paladins. So when i got overwatch I stoped playing paladins because i thought overwatch was more fun, but now a few months later i realised that paladins is a way more fun to play and just because of salt and toxicness. And as a bonus paladins is free, I would play it even if it were pay to play. And overwatch is 30 bucks last time I checked. It also doesnt have voice chat so little children dont scream in your face. Now im not saying paladins is better then overwatch, to me they're both great games, if you prefer one over another that is completly fine and i respect that just as long as you're having fun and enjoying you life in any game",Sat Nov 27 19:35:06 EET 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

cc8a3658-2b09-4b6f-899f-a774b4d0a44c,1,"As much as I like and even LOVE this game, the new OB68 kills the game for meI really like Paladins, people like to call it the ""poor-man's Overwatch"", but in my opinion it's really not a clone of OW, and it's a standalone and a fun game.But the new OB68 ruined everything I like about the game, and I'm here to say why.First up, ""Quest""We get to do a ""quest"" everyday, we get money for logging in, and rewards for playing. BUT, if you're a poor and broke player like me, who doesn't want to spend IRL money on game, you'll probably agree to what I'm gonna say,The old quest system,2 easy quest with money and VIP as rewards, and 1 big quest with Crystals and VIP as reward.Alot of us probably did the big quest just to get those crystals, I think we can all agree to that.But the new OB68 removed that, and replaced all of them with normal and easy quests.That just ruined it for me, cause I've to spend that long, that whole week just to get some crystals from daily logging rewards.Second of all, the cosmetics systemOne of the reasons why I like this game alot is because you can mix and match cosmetics like TF2.You can have great cosmetics combos, like Jenos' Jason Mask and the Millenium makes up a badass looking god character. You can have Viktor with the DOOM outfit and wears an eyepatch to look like somesort of menacing looking leader guy.But the new OB68 removed that feature, and you can only wear 1, JUST 1 COSMETICS AT A TIMEThe Jason Mask looks bland now, just a default Jenos with a different mask.Not only that, everytime you play a match, the items you have for your Champions will reset, meaning you'll have to equip them again on match everytime you want to use it, or you'll stuck with the default guns and stuff.Third, the menuAscension Peak is great, but the old menuJust the old menu brings and makes the game unique, but the new loading screen makes me sick.I know this game wants to be successful like Overwatch, but do you really have to go as far as making the ALMOST SAME MENU SCREEN FROM OVERWATCH?Really Hi-Rez? If you want to be successful and better, make something unique of your own.Fourth, the voice packsThe old voice packs, you can just get em for a few golds, but nowNOW YOU'VE TO SPEND 200 CRYSTALS JUST TO GET A SINGLE VOICE PACK FOR A SINGLE CHAMPION!What the ♥♥♥♥? Did you know how hard 200 crystals is to get them?I would've just spent them on skins like Tribalman for Grohk and Justice for Lex.The only thing I like about this ♥♥♥♥ing update is you can now get common items back.I'm trying to save up to get the Justice skin for Lex, and probably one for Skye, the Pilot.Common's are great, and they're sometimes better than Epic and Legendary skins.So Hi-rez, if you would please bring the good♥♥♥♥♥♥back, me and some of my friends, or possibly the community would be happy.--{UPDATE OB70}--Oh boy oh boy, where do I start with this...Ah yes, V I K T O ROne sentence, I HATED ITGOD HI-REZ, WHY DO YOU DO THIS?!Viktor is supposed to be a old war veteran soldier type of guy, not somesort of sort of chinese bootleg version of it. Viktor's got the typical ""I lost all my comrade in a mission and I take the blame"" cliche type of backstory, but the new Viktor doesn't seems to have that type of ""look and feel"" to it. The gun is nice, grenade is odd and the skin is♥♥♥♥♥♥ done.The new Viktor should be a skin instead in my opinion, like Young Viktor or something.The new Viktor just doesn't work, in my and alot of my friends opinion.Battle Pass, couldn't care less about it. The new skins for Jenos, Ruckus, Androxus and Grohk are absolutely fantastic and wonderful, they are really good and badass looking.The Mobile skins are also okay, ish. Covert Ops Lex is definitely a yes, Paladins Strike Maeve is just plain lazy, just give Dreamhack Maeve their mobile logo and some recolors and WALAH! A new ""skin"", although it's pretty lazy, I still like it and I appriciate their effort and time they spent on making these skins. But please make voice packs purchasable with gold instead of crystals, which is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in my, or everyones opinion.Also, rip VIP, rest in potatoAlso this game's got hella bugs in it, which is SO TERRIBLEThe game won't even render Terminus' ult properly, and I end up losing my 20 killstreak.",Sun Aug 09 11:34:25 EEST 2020,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

cc8a3658-2b09-4b6f-899f-a774b4d0a44c,6,"Early Access ReviewI started to play this game only because my friend asked me to try it, so that he can get a special skin through a referral. Initially, I was repelled:- by the fact that it is MOBA (I thought only kids and neckbeards play MOBAs)- by the cartoonish art style (the kind of sh-1-t you see all over deviantART)- by the fact that in every aspect this game tries to appeal to the teenager audience- by the generic character design that doesn't make any sense (for example, Lex - a black policeman-knight with two pistols and ridiculous blonde hairstyle from the 80's; Fernando - a wannabe knight with a flamethrower, Pip - an overconfident scientist in a racoon's (?) body that can turn enemies into chickens; Bomb King - his father was a tin can and his mother was a bomb)But, eventually, my friend persuaded me and I gave it a try, because there were no other MP games that we could play together at that time. At first, it was a bit hard for me, because everything was happening too fast and I didn't know which cards to select and how to play with each class. But I learned it quickly and soon became quite good at this game.It's very dynamic and despite it's numerous flaws, sometimes I enjoy it. There's enough strategy in it and there are plenty of characters to choose from for different play styles. There's something in it both for casual and competitive players. Also, it's not P2W and all you need you can unlock just by playing it – unfortunately, after last few updates it takes a lot of grinding.However, I should mention that matchmaking in this game is not balanced and quite often you get teamed up with complete 1d10ts. And Casual game is just random chaos with no solid teamplay.Anyway, this game is for free. So, there's no harm to trying it out. It's much better to play it with friends who are good at it than on a random queue. My overall rating: 6/10.I have given this game a negative review, because it doesn't isolate bad players from good players well enough.I play it only because, my friend can't play Overwatch on his potato machine.",Fri Dec 31 00:09:03 EET 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

This seems more balanced and smooth to me, and I really like the wide variety of heroes as well as their abilities. Of course, I haven't played it without all the new updates, so I can't really compare it from when it first came out till now.Once you find a hero you like and get comfortable with, it will become very fun to play. The heroes are on a rotation if you don't buy the $20 pack to all the heroes and future heroes. That doesn't bother me, as I have already found a hero I like to play with which you can unlock with gold coins. Usually 30000 coins to 60000 coins per hero. 30000 would take you a couple of days of casual-play to acquire. It's not bad, as in that time you can get familiar with the game, the mechanics, and what hero you really like and want to invest your time in.Some people are complaining about playing with bots.

Just because of the efforts Hi Rez is doing to defend its essence idea, I'm going with an impartial analysis, despite not liking this system at all.https://www.reddit.com/r/Paladins/comments/5vy7zd/essence_legendary_updates_thanks_for_all_the/If you want to read about the original essence clustermadness that happened with patch OB44, read at the end of the review from the Chapter ""The OB44 Patch: the essence cluster"". Now, let's proceed with a full review""PALADINS: A NEW-AGE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER""Many people are wondering what Paladins is. Is it a First Person Shooter? A MOBA? The copy of Overwatch for the poor guys? No, it's just a genre on its own. Paladins is firstly a First Person Shooter, but with elements that lead it to a new generation.In this game you'll play one of the available Champions, characters with their own abilities. Each one of them has got a ranged attack, 3 basic abilities with a variable cooldown (like in a MOBA, but fast-paced due to the nature of the game) and a powerful final ability with a way longer cooldown called Ultimate.Considering the fact that each hero has got a defined set of skills, they're inserted in roles, categories that enhance their efforts in certain tasks. So we have characters in the healing field, someone in dealing tons of damage points and others by defending the team with their bodies and lives.Once you picked up the suitable Champion for you, you'll fight to the death in the battlefield in different gamemodes, both against other players (Payload and Siege) and CPU (PvE and the brand-new Survival). At the end of the clash, you'll receive a reward in gold (used to buy some cosmetics, radiant chests that contains cards, essences and other cosmetics/emotes and moreover important stuff like the Champions) and in experience points (both for the Mastery, the level of the current Hero you're using, and the General Experience, the level of your profile).""CARDS LOADOUT: NOT YOUR OVERWATCH COPY, BABE""Reading the first chapter, somebody (or better, more than somebody) would say that Paladins is a copy of Overwatch: both are FPS, both have champions/hero with unique skills, both have different gamemodes, both have classes. But what are the differences in Paladins that brought it to be one of the most played Free-to-play games on Steam? What are its sex appeals?Paladins has introduced a system that might change your gameplay with a specific champion from match to match: the CARDS LOADOUTS.In this game each character has got 16 basic cards (divided in common, rare and epic à la HearthStone) and 3 legendary cards (Hearthstone inspired inc.). These cards are affecting the gameplay someway, changing general statistics (movements speed, basic health, reload speed, etc...) or the behavior of a certain basic ability (cooldown reduction, improved bonus, extra additional buffs, etc...). The basic cards can be put in a deck with a maximum of 5 and can be improved up to 4 times their original value. Those decks are the loadouts. When you insert a card, you spend 1 point. To improve a card, you spend 1 point. Considering this, you have to make a deck of 5 cards and spending a total of 12 points, no more no less. In few words, saving different loadouts, you can play a support as an utility, as a semi-flank or simply in its original role, but more efficiently.But what about legendaries, instead? The legendaries affect the gameplay way heavily than their basic counterparts, usually providing strong bonuses. Before the beginning of each match, you're allowed to choose only one of the legendaries you've got for a specific champion.Let's make a practical example: Fernando, a Spanish tank-defender knight, has got 3 legendaries that provide respectively an infinite shield duration with a reduced cooldown, the opportunity of healing himself up to a certain percentage during his shield relocation or improved damage by the launch of a fireball. Depending on the opponents you're facing and on your loadout, you might choose the infinite shield or another legendary.THE GAME ITSELFYeah, we talked about burocracy here: genre, card, boring stuff. But what about the game itself? Is it funny? Enjoyable? Of course it is, expecially with friends.Paladins is granting fun thanks to the fast-paced matches, sometimes facing opponents that would make clashes longer, but still enjoyable, at the pact you're playing casual. Because in competitive there aren't grains of salt, but entire salty oceans. If you know how to play, however, you'll be granted glady moments, but it's not always guaranteed, expecially if you meet the usual ""idiotic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" guy of the turn that flames and insults. But this happens in every game.That's why Paladins has 2 main Game Experience Walls: one related to the general experience level, the other related to the champions' mastery. You're playing against BOTS till level 5 and, to access competitive, you need to master 12 champions at level 4.FINAL CONSIDERATIONDespite the disappointment in the recent OB44 patch that made the game way more grindy, I enjoyed Paladins so far and I'm changing my original review from ""No, don't play"" to ""Yes, give it a try"" because Hi Rez is trying hard to encounter our esigences. So, in trust, I'll recommend this game. For now.***Here's the original review. You can read it for information, but not valid anymore***THE OB44 PATCH: THE ESSENCE CLUSTERHi-Rez introduced a new currency in game to buy cards which is called ESSENCE. In order to get this currency, you need to spend gold (or crystals, the real cash currency) on radiant chests and hope to find a duplicate card. If you want to craft a certain card, you need a huge amount of essence, expecially if we're talking about legendaries. But what are these cards?The cards are special modifiers that change your gameplay. Before the OB44 patch, you could buy any single card for an amount of 1200 gold each(consistently, below 50% of the actual cost of a radiant chest, where you find these cards). Now, if you want a card, you're forced to buy a chest and to pray the Random Generator Number to get the card you want. If you don't find it, you need to wait for ages before being able to get it.Despite the vast majority of Paladins Players said this system was only deletery and the worst idea to implement (because, if you consider you can buy these chests with real cash and you can get the cards only via these chests, the more you spend more powerful you get), Hi-Rez developers decided to insert this system anyway. But the worst thing of all is about news that transpired from some people playing the Closed Beta of Paladins and avalaible on Reddit Page.This system had been implemented once already during Closed Beta despite the complaints of the playerbase and has been removed only after few weeks later, because the players were tired of that crap and left the game. So, in few words...this mistake has been made once and has been corrected because the game was dying.Unless the devs wake up for a second time and decide to remove this disgraceful stuff (we're in a FPS game, not a MMORPG neither a MOBA), I won't suggest you to play this game because it will only contribute to the P2W campaign of some people, if not everyone of them, of the Hi-Rez HQ. However, in case the headers are going to change that stuff, my final review will change, of course, for the better. I'll wait for the next patch before deciding to leave this game or not, considering Hi - Rez so far managed to listen the community.",Sun Aug 09 13:48:44 EEST 2020,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

The characters are fresh, the maps are interesting, the abilities are decently balanced, there is almost nothing I can say that is not positive about this game. The fatal flaw is simply that this game suffers from the beta syndrome so many new exciting games suffer from. It started as a finished product, and then the developers decided to change it... over... and over... and over again. I liked this game a lot, and with every update I decided I would give it a good shot before deciding the update made the game play worse, but the truth is, every update makes the game play more dull. When you have a game with many characters, they tend to become less and less balanced over time, making it difficult for anyone to play a character that isn't in the meta. The skins are getting a little out of hand, I enjoy content in a game, but all of it is just paid cosmetics, making opening crates feel almost empty... Well, it would feel empty if it weren't for the fact that all of the ability upgrades and actually interesting mechanics in this game are tethered to micro-transactions. While you can technically own everything in the game just by playing for a long time, this would take thousands of hours, and it really does encourage you to buy things in order to enjoy them, there simply isn't enough gold and elixir for everything, at least not in an easily accessible fashion. The game is still fun, and it is definitely worth at least exploring because of the price (nothing), but it just isn't reaching its full potential.

Most people run off and do nothing or have no idea what they are doing. The characters used to be pretty equal and play thier roles well, but lack of thought into the new characters have made the game very uneven. You can have Evie to 1 health, she iceblocks, heals up, and then flys off. Zhin is a new character that can block ALL incomming attacks with his sword. Then when thats over if he is about to die, he can turn into smoke and fly away from you...he also takes no damage in this form. The game needs more work now than when it came out. I do not recommend this game to play for two reseaons:1: The player base is terrible. I have never played a game that has this many bad players. I have played allot of games! I can enter a game with two of my friends, and still lose easy because of the other two players that join. It seems like a game of trolls more then anything.2: The characters have become very unequal. This needs allot of attention. A flank should not be able to kill a damage or frontline character one-on-one unless they get the drop on them.

Champions are very diverse and a blast to play (especially Evie)There sure are problems and bugs that haven't been fixed for more than a year, and they really need to attend these.Some of these bugs are very frustrating and sometimes game breaking, and have a major impact on the overall impression the game leaves on new players.Especially the UI bugs need to be fixed ASAP if you want people to be taking this game seriously. Brilliant game, incredible gameplay - Lacks the polish and presentation of OW but in my opinion better in every other way.Suggestions to Hi-Rez:  prioritize bug fixing rather than skin releasing, fix hitboxes, increase TTK (the current snipefest meta is NOT appropriate - people play the game because it is NOT CS:GO), lag compensation, polishing, refining the presentation of the game. Personal request: Please add ultrawide resolution support (most games have that nowadays)Your competition (OW) is very tough, but your game has potential to become so much better,  so don't lose focus, keep working hard guys and keep on improving Paladins :D !",Sat Feb 13 01:10:32 EET 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051
a96d92c5-8342-4dbc-83eb-65b3598e294d,1,"Early Access ReviewThis is my first review that I have actually tried on but I hope to improve over time. This is my honest opinion of the game and information about the game. *PLEASE LEAVE SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IN THE COMMENTS SO I CAN IMPROVE*INTRODUCTIONPaladins, a game made by ""Hi-Rez Studios"". Hi-Rez Studios has experience in the MOBA business as this shows in there newest game, Paladins. Paladins is still in beta and also an Early Access game so of course the game is not fully complete. There will probably have been lots of updates and changes since I wrote this but I will try to update this as Hi-Rez Studios updates the game. Hi-Rez Studios are working hard on this game and consistently releasing quality updates. Paladins usually reaches a peak at around 40k players in 24 hours (as of the I am writing this review). This game is doing very well in player wise and it is no trouble finding a game.CLASSES/CHARACTERSPaladins is a game which looks a lot like Overwatch, the 2 games however play differently. If you have played either Overwatch or Team Fortress 2 you will see similarities in the characters you can play as. There are 4 different class types in Paladins: Front Line, Damage Dealer, Support and Flanker. In Paladins the Front Line is the objective player of the team, if you pick to play as a front line character your team will rely on you to be able to jump on the objective and win the game for your team. Secondly we have Damage Dealer. Damage Dealers... Deal a lot of damage! If you play as Damage Dealer you sit back behind your team and help out your Front Liners so they do not die on the objective. This is an important role in the team. Next we have Support. Support classes do not usually have a lot of health and they are not the best at dealing damage to the other team. If you play as support your best bet is to stay behind cover and heal your teammates who are playing the objective. Lastly we have Flanker. The flanker class is the class that I see being used the least. This may be because the players around my skill level can not use the Flanker characters properly. The Flankers job is to obviously flank around the other team to deal damage where they aren't looking.ITEMS/ABILITIESIn Paladins there is a skills store where you can buy skills to make your character stronger. An example of this is on a character that has a slow reload time you would buy the skill that decreases reload time. You get in game credits to buy skills by killing opponents, playing the objective etc. I think that Hi-Rez Studios could add a few more skills that are made towards certain characters as there is not much variety of items. I think that the rate you can buy more skills is perfect and Hi-Rez Studios has done a great job on it.There are also abilities in this game like there is in DOTA 2 or League Of Legends. Each character has their unique abilities that could change a whole game around at the click of a key. Each character also has an ultimate ability which you can not use as frequently as the other abilities but your ultimate ability is your strongest ability and you should only use it in situations which you really need it.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay in Paladins seems reasonably smooth. Currently there are only 2 game modes Siege and Payload. Siege is a game mode which is first to 4 wins. When the game starts your team will have to try capture a capture point while the other team also tries to capture it. Which ever team is victorious with the capture point will have to move a payload to the other teams base while the other team tries to stop the payload from moving. Secondly, Payload is a game mode where the one team tries to push a cart to the other teams base while the other team tries to stop this from happening. If the attackers are victorious then the sides switch and then the new attackers have to push the cart to the other teams side quicker than the previous attackers did.Paladins plays very well however, most of the maps look the same. Most of the maps are either in a temple or in a snowy area. I think that Hi-Rez Studios should add more variety to their maps.CARDSThere are certain card decks which come with every character. These are different to items but they basically to the same thing and give your character an advantage to the opponent if you have a good card build. The card system is reasonably complicated to explain in a review but you will eventually get the idea of how to use them correctly. For new players I would recommend using the standard card build which Hi-Rez Studios has already built for you.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCEPaladins is not a game with breathtaking graphics, sure if you play at maximum graphics then the game will look great but the graphics do not compare to games like Battlefield etc. I am pretty sure that having amazing graphics was not a priority for Hi-Rez Studios but I think that the graphics are more than acceptable for a game like this.For performance, this game runs pretty well. Paladins is optimised well enough and my friends who play Paladins frequently and I haven't encountered any problems with performance so I think that Hi-Rez Studios have done well.PAY TO WIN?Paladins is a free game so the company that made the game have to make money somehow. Hi-Rez Studios have made a good balance between making money and making the game pay to win. Paladins is not pay to win at all, the micro transactions that you can buy will not make you any stronger on the battlefield. CONCLUSIONPaladins is an overall well made game, it definitely is a fun game and I think that this game will not die anytime soon. You should download it and give it a go, if you don't like it... Try again in a few months after Hi-Rez Studios has made improvements to the game!OVERALL SCORE8/10-marra",Fri Jun 19 10:02:13 EEST 2020,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

But I don't like argument like that, because it basically allow you to compare anything to everything.Characters Kits are very different from Overwatch, even when they serve the same role.Paladis is a really fast paced game thanks to the horses (And also more chaotic), and got slightly more depth in character customisations thanks to the cards and in-game buyables.It's free, in Open Beta, and got a lot of potential. I feel like the only reason people spit on this game without giving it a chance is because Overwatch is a really really, really polished game so you don't really have worse than paladins in Hero Arena Shooter genre (Battleborn does not count, it's more of a Moba.)TL;DR Paladins is a Hero Shooter Arena with a lot of similarities with the only other Hero Shooter Arena available, yet it got potential to be a great game on its own, even if it won't surpass the other behemoth.",Mon Sep 06 04:22:29 EEST 2021,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0
bd83ca3e-931e-4120-9ea1-3bbaebf1419a,3,"Early Access ReviewTL;DR this game was good, now it sucks because Hi-Rez cares more about profit than its playerbase.I have been playing this game for over a year, and I have over 1.5k hours on it. In the beginning, this game was super fun, there were a lot of different champs with different playstyles. There were different ways you can play each champ, so basically just a lot of customization. The game was relatively skill-based where a good player would be able to win most of his/her games. Having said all this, the direction this game is heading in is absolutely the wrong direction. The next update that is meant to come out at the time I am writing this is OB 64, and with this update, the game has spelled its end. I say this because the game has become too reliant on microtransactions.Each champion in this game has a set of cards that define his/her playstyle, and you can guess that these cards are vital to the playstyle of the champ. Before OB 64, players were able to unlock any card customize its level within the specific loadout. What Hi-Rez has done now is make it so that all these cards are unlocked for you already but the individual levels of these cards can only be increased by getting duplicates of these cards.To obtain duplicates, unsurprisingly, you must open loot boxes. According to a source on reddit, it would talk you AT LEAST 984,000 gold to upgrade a set of cards to their max level for ONE champion, and there are a total of 34 champions in the game as of now. To put this into perspective, you earn around 300-500 gold per match, so yeah, calling it a grind is an understatement. You could expect this level of grind in an MMORPG, but not in a hero shooter.But, if you're willing to pay for crystals to unlock these chests, then you can get a quick headstart on other players. The reason for this is Hi-Rez is marketing this game in China. The Chinese playerbase love microtransactions, and so Hi-Rez has made this patch in anticipation of the influx of Chinese players. To be fair, there is a competitive mode where everyone has the same level cards, but this only means that you are not bale to practice your champions in a casual mode, and there is also the fact that players are used to having some cards at different levels. All in all, this game is dying, Hi-Rez does not care about its playerbase, and don't play this game. Also, check out these reviews of Hi-Rez, makes it look like a pretty good company, huh?

The combat is fast and fluid and by keeping the powers to a minimum, it's easy to pick up and learn. I did not even need to go watch the tutorials. A single round in-game and I knew how to play. As a free to play game, not once have I felt pressured into buying anything. This is not pay to win and it is not pay to win faster.Things I dislike... I guess there are 2 issues for me at time of writing. It seems like most players struggle to shake the Deathmatch instincts and are too scared to take risks and play the objectives. This is an objective-based game. The mission always comes first.My second issue is that the servers seem to be having a hard time keeping up wih all the players that joined since the steam launch. Finding issues where I can't login or the game gets stuck on authenticating.

df96495d-cf6e-4468-aee7-44f2a2c734b4,4,"Early Access ReviewPaladins WAS an amazing FPS MOBA game that gave you Overwatch-esc gameplay, with a twist.The best part of Paladins was you could customize the champions to YOUR play style using cards and loadouts. I always hated how Overwatch made you bend to the style of the character you were playing.Paladins was a game I would consider my personal favorite, It was my goto game to play with friends. It was free to play without any pay to win garbage thrown in....Notice how I said was.OB64 is a way for Hi-rez to give Paladins the Star Wars BattleFront 2 treatment, except Disney isn't here to slap Hi-rez on the wrist for screwing up.OB64 Takes the customization I praised so highly before and asks ""How can we earn more money from that?"" Prior to OB64 loadouts had a limited number of points you could give to your cards per loadout. Cards had a maximum of 5 levels and you had 5 cards per loadout. It was easy and fair, everyone had the same amount of points to dedicate to a loadout and no loadouts were objectively better just because you gave Hi-rez a little more ca$h.Cards were obtained using Essence which you got by logging in, completing quests and getting duplicates which was a very easy task.In OB64 each card has a Max level of 10 and the level is no longer determined on a per-loadout basis, now cards are always the same level nomatter what loadout they're in. How do you level up cards? Why duplicates ofcourse! How do you get duplicates? by opening radiant chests (Lootboxes), which you obtain by playing the game...or by paying some extra $$$ for some chest keys to speed up the process. The grind is rediculous and it's very unbalanced. Radiant chests contain 3 items per chest (4 if you purchase a boost...ofcourse) there are over 20 champions each of them having an equal amount of cards so it'd impossible to focus on leveling up a specific champion...well sorta.Champion chests are a thing, which are chests that will only give you items for 1 specific champion which decreases the grind..slightly, you can purchase these chests with gold or by playing a bunch with one champion in the UNBOUND mode.Paladins now has 2 modes Unbound (Pay 2 Win) and Classic (The old game but stripped to it's core.)Unbound mode gives you 3 gamemode options Seige, Onslaught and Payload.Unbound players can have card levels ranging from level 1 - 10 (fair right?)Classic Mode gives you 1 gamemode with 2 flavors. Siege, Competitive Seige.Forces all cards to Level 4.Competitive mode is ranked..obviously.It's sad that Hi-rez has gone down this Pay-To-Win road.Hi-rez doesn't listen to the community backlash and overall would sacrifice fan loyalty for a few extra dollars.This game is now a game for the whales. The only thing we can hope for now is for Paladins to recieve a ""Mostly Negative"" on steam and let it die.Honestly If Hi-rez came to me and said they reverted back all the changes they made in OB64 and begged me to come back, I wouldn't. If they'll do this once they'll do it again, thats the end of that.It pains me to give what once was my favorite game a bad review, but I have to try and spread the word to potential new players. If you're new and looking for a good fun game to play with your mates, Paladins is not the game for you.",Mon Aug 30 17:21:31 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

7249ea50-b281-4d7a-aa66-6c70d54434c5,1,"Early Access ReviewMarch 16th, 2018:I'll get the first thing out of the way:  the game is fun again...somewhat, not quite perfect like it was pre OB-44 (yes, I'm going back to Essence system, the first sign of trouble.)  I am also reviewing based on what I've known and not about the unknown future.  I hear good things about the current exec, but I never played the game he saved, so I wouldn't know...other than the game is the only game that HiRez has had running for more than a year and a half.That's the problem:  I love this game, it's a great game, but I can't trust HiRez.The way I see it, HiRez has done what Coke-Cola did in 1985: completely change their formula and using some what half-baked, low amount of positive results to push the change....and then slap a price on it (at least New Coke was the same price as old Coke....)That backfired...hard....forcing the company back to the original design after a few months.With that, I cannot reccomend this to people full heartedly.  I say: ""give it a taste,"" and that's about it.====December 7th, 2017 Rage:Avoid this company and its fetish for self canibalizing its games.====September 17, 2016 Review: Firstly I am going to get my elephant out of the room.I am still butthurt at HiRez for what they did to my favourite childhood series: Tribes. They took it, stole its money, dressed it up as something else, and then abandonded it in a gutter in Detroit....So I really, REALLY want to hate everything they make.This game, I can't.Now I'll get the other elephant in the room out.Yes this game has similarities to Overwatch....or BattleBorn...whatever you want to call that, BUT, if I were to make a negative review based on that, then I'd have to make a negative review on Overwatch for Ripping off Firefall / Super Monday Night Combat. All those games have classes that use skills based around, except this game, Overwatch--BattleBorn I guess if you played it--and FireFall have ""ultimates.""So. There I said it. Overwatch sucks because it ripped off FireFall, and this game sucks because it Ripped off BattleWatch Guns of FortQuake 4 Tournament 2142.Yet I thumb it up because I find it fun and charming in its own little way. The customization you can get--not cosmetics, the cards--can make just about each champion a different play out. I'll take my man, Drogoz, for example. Make one deck of cards to make him an AoE nightmare, or another set to make him a 1v1 murderer...can't quite do that with my Lady, Pharah (though her Ult is so much easier to use..)Each ""Skill"" combos into each other. I'll say...Viktor's Grenade into his Fully Loaded rifle...is a scary thing to encounter when you fight someone who can do that well. Cassie can get a loadout that makes her super lethal if you can land every shot...And so on.Really, just give the game a try...play around a bit...you can always uninstall it later for no cost.===And Seriously HiRez, give us the damn Thundersword Bomber in Tribes: Ascend already...maybe I'll hate you less after that.

I didn't find that the loss of the sandbox navigation of the first game detracts from gameplay at all, which I've heard was a common complaint; personally, I felt it made things easier because Crysis 1 always had me wondering if I was going in the right direction.

I disliked the change to a silent protagonist and I was disappointed that the story wasn't continued as Nomad, which I think could have been accomplished. I also think that the story felt just a tad too silly with character reactions and revelations throughout the game.

Finally, I'm sad to say that using the stealth suit is still the most overpowered way to finish the entire game because enemies suddenly lose track of you when you stealth,  and I had multiple occasions where they would shoot straight at me and every bullet/shotgun pellet would pass straight around me.

333ffd90-5e67-4fad-83c3-99f398df33d6,6,"Early Access ReviewPut down the game after a long break from playing it and came back to some half baked utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 'cards unbound' system which took away the customization of player cards in the game that has existed ever since release(and I've been playing ever since the game was released). This might not seem like a big thing but it takes away one of the big factors that has always been fun in Paladins: you can customize your champion to your playstyle by use of cards that upgrade certain abilities. You can take a tank and have them become more of a flank or stay in the tank role and keep defending your teammates. There were different ways to play but everything had a set limit, you could only upgrade a card in your loadout to a level 4 and had a limit of how many upgraded cards you could use in a loadout, that way you're not too overpowered. This system made sense and it made for great gameplay in the few moments when the game was ridiculously unbalanced with some champions.However, with what seems to be a new thing in the most recent update, this system is now gone, with people now starting at square 1 again and having to put either gold or $$ towards buying lootboxes for specific heroes just for the chance that they can level up cards again. Each champion has over 20 cards and some cards need to be leveled up more than once in order to actually gain a level. i.e. you will have to get a duplicate of a card 4 times, in some cases, in order to level it up once, and then get more duplicates to upgrade it again. It's a cash grab and a way to make the game unbalanced, yet again. Now, this might not seem like a big thing to a new player, and I can understand that. But I've been playing for awhile now when the only currency you needed was gold and gems if you wanted to buy cosmetics. Both are still around, but through the updates 3 different types of currencies have been added to the game. There was essence, something you gained through cards and duplicate cards, and were then used to unlock cards in the first system mentioned up above. Nothing too bad, a welcome addition. Next was VIP tokens which, to this day, I still don't understand because it's so obviously another cash grab because you can get 'premium cosmetics' for a subscription based price or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. And then... lootboxes. They've been around, sure, but with each patch, more and more lootboxes were created. Lootboxes for only getting a weapon, only getting an event skin, only getting this that and the other thing. Oh, did you really want this cosmetic item? Too bad. Use real money to but a lootbox and see if you have the chance to win it. If not, thanks for the money. Paladins used to be a free to play hero shooter, but through the updates and time that this game has been out, it's dissolved into an obvious cash grab, Pay to Win, and an unbalanced game where the devs barely know what they're doing half the time and ignoring the playerbase while doing so. tl;dr don't get the game, it's a greedy product that now introduced pay to win mechanics",Tue Sep 28 02:56:34 EEST 2021,7538609a-a5e1-47e9-9b84-f27b650d683c

It is not as much of a overwatch ""clone"" as people claim, as it has a variety of game modes, more focus on team play, then solo play, and a lot more champion variety. Rather than healers being boring as heck, they can actually be insanely challenging and fun, along with tanks. Also, a large shining feature is the mobility you get in game. Rather then being slow and stuck in one general area, you can quickly move around the map, getting where you need to go in seconds.",Thu Aug 05 19:39:41 EEST 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051
333ffd90-5e67-4fad-83c3-99f398df33d6,10,"Overall, I think the story and big reveal of this game was quite fascinating. I like how this game merges a lot of historical/fantasy themes with science fiction. There are some bugs, and that could be just to it being a bit of an older game (as well as the PC port maybe not being as optimized as it could be), but I found that for the most part it didn't affect my gameplay experience. The one thing that did was how animations were hardly smooth, and dialogue segments (where you talk to other characters and get to choose your response) are really choppy and feel awkward. If there was one thing I hope they will improve in the second game (as this one clearly has set up for a sequel) is that they improve the min cut scenes when you interact with characters in dialogue (think Mass Effect). There were times where, due to the outfit I was wearing, the over the shoulder shots of other characters talking were blocked by the headdress. Overall, though, I recommend it to anyone who's into doomsday, post apocalypse, sci-fi, adventure games.",Thu Oct 07 05:46:14 EEST 2021,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

Also I prefer the healers in Paladins, when in ow I mainly play dps and sometimes healer.

If you want a hero team based shooter that takes actual SKILL and has actual DEPTH then Paladins is the game for you. Paladins has the card system which can change how a character plays entirely to enhancing it. It also has itemization like in MOBA. Overwatch looks good, but it plays like a f2p title. Ranked isn't about skill, it's about who gets the worst team comp or the worst players on team. In Overwatch you could be the best player in the world vs 5 average players with at least a brain and you can't do much. In Paladins you can actually carry your team thanks to the moba aspects with the abilities and items. The downvotes that have to do with Paladins performance how ever is true. The game has a lot of bugs sadly. You will encounter at least one a match at the very least. If you want to play a fun but casual hero based shooter that looks good, then get overwatch. If you want to play a fun & more in-depth hero shooter that looks ehhh, then play Paladins. Also you overwatch fanboys are ignorant. Stop saying Paladins ripped overwatch off when Paladins was in the making before OW announcement. Only difference is Paladins had the cards and it was closer to a tribes map instead of typical hero shooter maps/gamemodes. But the internal testing wasn't that great. OW was also Titan at first then changed. If you want to say Paladins is a rip off, then OW is a rip off of the TF series easily. It adds nothing new mechanic wise, yet Paladins does. Blizzard hasn't made a single unique product since It's WoW & Diablo 1 & 2, Starcraft days. Diablo 3 is a horrible noob friendly ARPG that took away everything great about Diablo. Hearthstone is a noob friendly p2w mtg wannabe card game. HoTS is a horrible attempt at ripping off a MOBA.

By example, imagine the enemy team has a lot of heroes with shields, then you can upgrade you character to inflict more damage on shields, therefore youÂ´ll be able to carry your team easily. These kind of things are what give Paladins a great strategic feel, and I liked it. You could also decide to upgrade your reloading speed, etc... that can be a vital change in the battleground.On the other hand, there is one thing I didnÂ´t like, but ItÂ´s normal due to it being a Free to Play and Overwatch a Paid game, IÂ´m talking about microtransactions. Yes, Overwatch has microtransaction, but itÂ´s totally optional, as IÂ´ve gotten a ton of Legendaries without having to buy crates, but in Paladins you got those crates that can almost only be purchased via real money, and thatÂ´s a shame because the skins that can be got by normal crates are kinda lame (just same skin with diferent colors)In conclusion, I think this game is great, (I still prefer Overwatch due to characters, etc...) and ItÂ´s totally not P2W, something positive looking at nowadays F2P shooters, and if you want to give it a try, do it, itÂ´s free!",Tue Sep 14 08:42:45 EEST 2021,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103

I've had my share of game time, and this game is really really really poorly managed, and slowly becoming a pay-to-win and money sucking, and here are the reasons why:1-First of all, the bugs, my goodness the amount of bugs in this game is insane. For example, ShaLin's Knockback doesn't work half the time (damage goes through but not the knocknack), or Zin's ult (with the damage immunity card) and you guessed it, you take damage and die. Or maybe the fact that I can't see my mouse 80% of the time, no matter what I do (good luck trying to select cards and items). I could make a list of the insane amount of bugs there are, but it's not worth it. You're gonna tell me ""this is early access, so bugs are expected"". No, even in an early access game, when there are bugs, when they are reported, they should be fixed. Meanwhile, instead of doing that, Hi-Rez is making skins and champions, and making premium currencies to suck up money, along with other money grabbing stuff, meanwhile the bugs increase with each patch.2-The ranking system, holy. Why in the world would you have a ranking queue separate of the normal gamemodes ? What's the point of the ranked queues if you're gonna get matched with unranked and bronze players all the time ? The whole point of having ranking queues in a game is to get matched with people the same level as you. Proof that this sytem is pretty much stupid, look at other game's ranking system, all of them have linked ranked and normals, yet no one is complaining there, but are complaining here. But no, you have a hidden MMR for ranked and another one for normal games, meaning that in normals you get matched with bronze and unranked players, which means that you will lose a lot of games, your MMR goes down, and you're stuck with bronze and unranked players for the rest of your normal games. Meanwhile, you're gold or higher on your ranked queues (I was Platinum IV a month ago or so, but I stopped playing, so I got dropped to Gold V). Don't even get me started on the ranked queues matchmaking system.3-Cards have now made the game a pay-to-win, and it will slowly become one fully. Cards used to be static stats that everyone had identical, all you had to do is unlock them. Now what are they ? they're level restricted, which means that the level of the cards influences the power of the card. And how do I level up my cards ? You guessed it, you buy chests. Let's take a scenario: You have 2 Kinessa's aiming at each other's heads, 70% health, they both shoot at the same time, except that unfortunately for you, one of the 2 spent a lot of money on chests, and has level 10 cards, where the other Kinessa has level 4 cards. You guessed it, the Kinessa that spent money on the game had an advantage over the other, leaving one of the two alive instead of both dying on that shot. I seriously despise pay-to-win, and I thought this game wouldn't become one, but I can see that it is gonna be one.",Sun May 24 03:57:38 EEST 2020,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

They copied Battlefront 2's failed P2W progression system. Casual is now based on how much you can spend or how much crazy time you can grind to earn options you had easier and sometimes direct access to before this patch. Legendary cards (the choice that most defined your playstyle with a character) is now tiered the same way, forcing you to pull out the wallet, and take a chance. Everything i had done and learned was just ripped away. Now it's the pay-way or the highway. They used to ask you to buy lootboxes. Now they are demanding it. Hirez went from beggars to Loansharks.

Card system adds some twist to it: you can configure your character to abuse your favorite tactics or ability. No way to make it imbalanced though. Plus you can buy items for credits you earn in match (like in Dota) So: + Nice core gameplay+ Card system that allows for some customisation+/- Simple shop (no complex item combos)+ Pip and Bomb King are cute and positive- Only one game mode for now (now 2, but its all about pushing the payload)- Team chat only, you can't talk to your enemyAnd since I played other Hi-Rez products:+ No ""premium accounts"", ""XP boosters"" and other crap you're encouraged to buy every single second (looking mostly at Global Agenda here). Game doesn't remind you of microtransactions at all, which is great.+ Fast progression. You get 500 gold for leveling a hero up and about 200 gold per match, while all but one heroes cost 5000. You may need to farm a little for cards though.I don't usually write reviews after just 12 hours in the game, but you should play it now, while microtransactions don't bite and community seems pretty friendly (all those ""clone wars"" and such only affect forums).",Mon Apr 12 21:29:06 EEST 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

By example, imagine the enemy team has a lot of heroes with shields, then you can upgrade you character to inflict more damage on shields, therefore you´ll be able to carry your team easily. These kind of things are what give Paladins a great strategic feel, and I liked it. You could also decide to upgrade your reloading speed, etc... that can be a vital change in the battleground.On the other hand, there is one thing I didn´t like, but It´s normal due to it being a Free to Play and Overwatch a Paid game, I´m talking about microtransactions. Yes, Overwatch has microtransaction, but it´s totally optional, as I´ve gotten a ton of Legendaries without having to buy crates, but in Paladins you got those crates that can almost only be purchased via real money, and that´s a shame because the skins that can be got by normal crates are kinda lame (just same skin with diferent colors)In conclusion, I think this game is great, (I still prefer Overwatch due to characters, etc...) and It´s totally not P2W, something positive looking at nowadays F2P shooters, and if you want to give it a try, do it, it´s free!",Sat Feb 13 19:34:50 EET 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

7a93cabf-c575-4ebc-9a7e-e9c8bfe86773,7,"It's hard not to recommend this game. I've finished it once on PS4 and now I have the pleasure of giving it another go on PC. With an RTX 2080 S, this game runs very smooth and the visuals are absolutely stunning. I've encountered a few instances of stuttering and some dopey bugs, but nothing that's really kept my experience so far from being a fun one.

Beyond graphics, this is a brilliant piece of science fiction writing (that I will spoil NONE of for you) with a well voiced cast of characters to drive the narrative forward. The main character Alloy is played wonderfully by the often hilarious Ashley Burch. Her performance emphasizes the idea of her character being an outcast in that she speaks so differently from all the others of her homeland. While the common tribesmen and women speak as though they are of a relatively ancient culture, she sounds like a modern woman. It's hard not to fall in love with the occasional cheesy one liners she throws out.

Gameplay wise, Horizon draws from the traditional open world playbook. There are plenty of locations to find, fog of war clearing towers to climb, ruins to pillage for crafting supplies and gear, merchants who sell you gear, unique towns, bandit camps. It's all there and waiting for you to tackle. It's not necessarily new, but the world building and vistas you encounter are so tantalizing, it makes it all worth the while. Where the game truly shines is in it's hunting loop. It's not often that I find a game where every gear piece, weapon, and armor set actually have a meaningful impact. They all play into a system that, as our good buddy Todd Howard likes to proclaim, ""Just works!"" Every tool at your disposal and component that you rip from dead enemies' bodies will aid you in hunting the many varied machines that roam the massive landscape.

The only negative comment I can make about Horizon is that its save system kinda sucks. You find campfires around the world, and though there are many, death reverts you and the world back to the last save you made. So, if you leveled up twice and forgot to save after an hour and a half, well, you're SOL. You'll be grinding back up to that lost level for as long as it takes.

Overall, this is one of the finest games to come out on the last generation of consoles. One that PC gamers now have the pleasure of experiencing on their overly expensive machines!",Sat Jan 16 16:23:51 EET 2021,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

Ok, but seriously, this game is good. It's considered one of the best superhero games ever made for a reason, and it definitely deserves its reputation. I do have some issues with it, though. Combat feels mashy, and it never really grows out of that despite adding different enemy types as the game goes on. You really just mash your way through the basic enemies and then press TWO buttons instead of ONE to get rid of the special enemies. Game design! But the combat is fun, if basic, so it gets a pass. The most interesting gameplay definitely comes from the stealth sections. You can get super creative in how you handle them, and they're by far the most fun part of the game. The story is pretty good. Kevin Conroy does an amazing job as Batman, and of course, Mark Hamill as Joker is incredible. Those two actors make this game that much more immersive with how well they portray Batman and Joker. The world is incredibly detailed, with tons of references and easter eggs scattered throughout the map that really flesh out Arkham City in the Batman universe. Speaking of the Batman universe, Batman's Rogues Gallery is on full force. So many cool villains are here. Two Face, Joker, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, even lesser known characters like Victor Zsasz and Calendar Man. I might be a little biased reviewing this game because of how much I love Batman and all the characters in Batman stories, but this game is great, despite some parts falling a tad short.

42bd0d93-f909-4819-b4fe-0e7eed72009d,9,"I'm writing this at a time where I'm very...let down..by Paladins. OB64.Anyway, the pros... yeah, this was a fun kinda casual competetive hero shooter/moba. Overwatch clone? Sort of, but with enough identity to make it fun. Also the card system allowed for customization of your characters, much like the talent trees do in Heroes of the Storm.The grind was there, but overall I earned enough gold and essence to get the stuff I wanted. I also spent some real money on a few packs, and a few cosmetics. It was worth it.With OB64, they're essentially getting rid of casual queue, the one that most players play. They are changing the card system to introduce a *huge* grind wall, or you're forced to pay literally $1000+ to level your cards up to 5 by getting a crazy amount of duplicates from lootboxes.If your cards aren't level 5, you're screwed. You'll get stomped without any real chance to fight back. An example:Your Bob, his punch deals 500 damage with the level 1 card.The enemy Bob, his punch deals 2500 damage with a level 5 card.You struggle to deal damage. Enemy hits you twice and you're dead.Bob has 2000 health by default with a level 1 card.Enemy Bob has the card at level 5, boosting his health to 5000.In short: There's no more balance. It's ruined. They created an unfair playing field. Casual/Quick Play queue is extremely crap and frustrating to play now. Ranked isn't for everyone, and even if you play it, all cards are level 3, no exception. More fair, but doesn't really offer any balance either.Devs have said they *will* push this patch on december 13th.My thoughts? With the extremely negative reception of this patch, I foresee many players leaving, or playing less. It looks to me like they want to end this game, and make as much last ditch effort money off it as they can, right near the holidays. Overall, Paladins seems to be going the way of Tribes: Ascend and Global Agenda, two other now-dead HiRez games. They registered a new IP for a sort of PUBG clone. We'll see if that'll work, I guess.I dunno if the devs really want this change, or if the management is pushing this through. Either way, it's going to happen. Also, it's useless to voice your concern about it to the devs. It usually gets ignored. Heck, my post offering constructive criticism and suggestions on alternative ways to handle these changes were deleted for no reason at all. It was not offensive, not one bit. And yet, that gets deleted. I made a post about my post getting deleted: Also removed within 5 minutes. -.- If that's how kind concerned players are being treated, then forget it. Let your game die, then. >.>My advice: Don't spend money on Paladins. Don't even bother playing it. It's sad, because I genuinely enjoyed the game, despite the many bugs. I would recommend you at least try it, if it wasn't going in this direction. I'd say..wait at least 'till summer 2018 to see how it has survived. I myself will be keeping an eye on it from a distance. But the Paladins team has lost my trust, and my respect, with both the game changes and their treatment of my offered assistance.If you *really* want to play a PvP focused MOBA-ish game by HiRez, play Smite. It's been out of beta for years and relatively stable and played by millions. I've certainly enjoyed it since I started playing, and I'm nearing my third year of playing Smite. It's not perfect, but it's heading in a better direction than Paladins.So sadly, no, I can't recommend this game to anyone. Not unless they fix all the crap they're breaking with OB64. No more lootboxes. No more grind2win or pay2win. No more unfair playing field. Fix the bugs. The random ending of matches, to name one. Or the voice/chat mute buttons no longer working. And a plethora of others.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update July 2018:Well, they sort of saw OB64's negative impact and changed it. Reverted back to the old card system. That's good. They removed Payload maps. Now you can only play Siege and Deathmatch. Wait wat? Where's Onslaught, the king-of-the-hill mode? Oh, it's *in* the Deathmatch queue. Yeah. The two modes are combined in one queue. So over half the time you'll play Deathmatch (on the only DM map available) when you really wanted Onslaught. Why? This is such a stupid decision.I've tried out some practice stuff after this and...I guess it's fine. The only match I played went horribly so I can't really comment too much on the state of the game. But I'll say this:Don't be fooled by Paladins suddenly no longer being in beta. The game is still very much beta. They had to remove the beta tag for the Nintendo Switch release since Nintendo doesn't allow beta games on their platform. There's so much they still have to fix, and they never really do, anytime soon or at all. They changed the main screen to mimic Overwatch's quite directly. They haven't finished all the loading screen cards, to mimic Smite's loading screen.I dunno, there's so much wrong...I'm sure it's playable to a degree, but.. sigh.. this game's already lost my trust and my respect. I could technically play a little here and there, but I'm no longer motivated to invest as much time in it as I used to. Or at all, really.I'll just stick with Smite. It's far from perfect, but I have more faith in it, as well as its continued evolution. So far it hasn't pulled a horrible move like OB64.",Fri Dec 31 20:59:34 EET 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef
d9399ff5-69c7-4bbb-b518-15387b689527,10,"Early Access ReviewThis game was fun, for sure. It used to have an interesting deck customization system that allowed you to choose different play styles.But with OB64 this is going to change in a few minutes now (game has been down for 9 hours because of update deployment). No more free deck customization, introduction of a P2W mode for what used to be casual (a place to chill and train). Ranked games won't allow customization anymore. Every decision made for this patch is messed up.If you are still considering downloading this game here are a few other points where Hi-Rez lost this game and failed this community:- Matchmaking is terrible (not based on your skills or rank).- Power Creep is live with new champs always making more dmg than the older ones.- Balance is completely inconsistent with changes that can kill your champ in one single update. Just for reasons that won't ever be explained (say hi to Ash for me).- Bugs everywhere that made us call this game Palabugs (true story).- Support team will never really help you if you loose points based on techical bugs. At the end of the day, it is always unclear if it is on their side, so they consider it's your fault (presumption of innocence anyone?).- Community has never been shaped well. They do not listen to their players.- They release more and more heroes that require no skill (auto aim or crazy area dmg).Anyway, if you are still going to hit that ""play now"" button, good luck, have fun.

From 20 cards, you pick 5 which enhance certain abilities and aspects of champion. So you can play chosen champion how you see fit. Go full shield tank or trade tankiness for choice to be more aggressive, be supreme healer or add mobility, etc.Also big plus is that it looks great and runs great on lower-end machines.

And it's free-to-play, so that's saying a lot!It's not as polished as OW, but most of the subtle differences in gameplay make it more suited to my tastes. It's slower, has WAY less one-hit-kill situations, the Ultimates are not as impactful in the team fights, and has way more hitscan weapons. The matches have way less crazy, over-the-top stuff going on than OW, but at the same time I rarely feel frustrated at cheap deaths or extremely lucky plays from my opponents. Items seem like they could be this super deep and interesting system, but they're really not. Once the match starts you pretty much know what are the optimal items to buy. They do affect the strategy in hero picks, though. And the hero-picking is PERFECT. I wish OW had hero-picking in Competitive like Paladins does!Speaking of Comp, the competitive scene in LatAm is pretty much non-existant, though, so unless you want to just hang around Casual mode and have fun, like I do, it is not worth the time investment.Finally, the game is very much alive.

The story is top notch, world is beautiful, enemies are interesting, mechanically it's pretty good.  The devs really let their imaginations out of the cage with this game.  The fact that it's grounded in the real world made the story and landscapes just connected enough to IRL to be cool.

A couple things in particular started to sour my experience toward the end, though.  The open world here is not like Skyrim where you could potentially wander for hours and only run into a couple wolves and a bear unless you entered a POI.  There are enemies absolutely everywhere, just waiting to harass you at every turn.  That was unbelievably tiresome after a while, and the only way to fix it is a specific type of gear.  One of the other negatives is that the story gets so data heavy toward the end that I eventually just started skipping all of it- a neverending deluge of information when you just want the story to peak is not great.

Overall, if you like story driven, open world (ish) games, you'll enjoy this.",Tue Mar 31 22:42:05 EEST 2020,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

I played the game far more in its earlier stages when it was balanced, and actually good.That's before ammunition was added to the gameBefore rolesWhen everyone was a dpsAnd you fought in a moba-style map.Paladins has gone nowhere but completely downhill. If you're thinking ""Oh the reviews are getting bombed, must just be some salty players about some random nerf."" Do not shrug these off. Paladins has reworked their entire system to be fully pay-to-win. Not just Pay to Win, but the current design murders the fun for every veteran of the game.The only way to physically win in this game is to pay horrid amounts of real money for chests. Let me summarize this massive update: When Star Wars: BattleFront 2 (2017) was ruined by its loot box system, Hi-Rez literally (and I mean literally) took inspiration and applied the exact same system into Paladins. This game is exactly the same as Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (2017)'s progression.Veteran players who had every single item in the game (For example: Me)Veteran players who dumped hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game (For example: Me)These players had their collections destroyed.

Fernando was a thing long before Overwatch was a pipe dream. I own both games, and I have no bias towards either company, I like both companies' past works. I prefered Paladins over Overwatch for many, many reasons. Main reason was Paladins required decent skill and knowlege of the game to do well. Now I play neither.

It's one of those unspoken type principals nobody really says out loud but many think it. The most popular game of a genre and its fanbase for some magical reason become the template/standard or judge for any other game of same or similar content that comes out.

78a1a805-e903-4028-ae96-e74e49ef5d0c,6,"Early Access ReviewRating: bad (4/10) Introduction Paladins is a First/Third Person Shooter in a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena setting, where with a team of mates you have to push an objective towards the enemy base to win points in a round. Gameplay & Story: 3/10 I waited with my review for the last big patch to hit to see the progress of the game and sadly, if before the patch I would have recommended this game, after the patch I sadly can not. The gameplay consisting of you hitting the enemy quicker than he hits you, using abilities at the right time and individualising your character the way you enjoy it most, has been quite ""broken"" by the patch. Getting Master rank in competetive in just few weeks, I can tell, that even though Hi-Rez states they are knowing what they are doing with the game, the feedback they receive from players after this patch definetely shows they do not. Introducing card levels also introduced ""Pay2Win"" elements to the game (outside of ranked mode), the last patch hit tons of bugs effecting all the modes, like players disappearing under the floor, objectives no getting counted while you stand on the payload or the point, players doing damage after they died, cards not working properly, etc. Most of my friends and clan members quit the game and I trying to wait for fixes, there is nothing left but follow them. Combat & Challenge : 3/10 The competetive side of the game being playing ranked in team of 5 players or alone has been also destroyed by the patch. The balance shifted heavily in favour of some champions, but the real problem of ranked is more the bugs and cheats currently abused in even high ranked matches. And even though the combat itself still stayed fun, there is no purpose behind it anymore, so if you are only for a quick fun shooting some people in the faces, you might enjoy it but long term the drive for becoming high ranked is destroyed since it is all about which side gets most game-breaking bugs and champions. Graphic & Interface : 6/10 The graphic in Paladins is definetely likable and is not effected by the negative touch for the last patch brought live. The characters are fun, animations fluid and all abilities are recognisable. What still is on a level of a year 2010 multiplayer game is the interface in main menu and game mode selection. The whole interface is looking clunky and takes a while getting used to aswell the store feels clunky. The game selection mode hides behind multiple buttons, while in ranked the champion selection could be improved by a lot, even if they would take examples on competitor games like LoL. Progress & Mini-Games : 2/10 The progress of buying more champions and unlocking the cards has also been broken by the patch. Now you have to either farm months to get the cards leveled up on a champion you want to play, or you will get stomped in unranked matches. Obviously, there is a possibility to buy them through the cash shop...The progress in ranked has been destroyed by the bugs and at the moment not good balance. There are no mini-games in Paladins, so not much to value more in this section besides the summary: unranked = P2W or grind for months, while ranked = broken due to bugs and unbalance. Audio & Immersion : 7/10 The audio is something well done in this game, since every hero has a recognisable ability sounds and especially ultimates let you hear who is using theirs. The voice packs give a nice touch to the character and the emotes are sounding fun. Some random chatter the champions are doing is fun to listen to. Audio was and definetely is currently the more qualitatively made part of this game. Side-Notes This game offers multiplayer experience in unranked games with different modes, a dominiation (push payload to enemy base) mode in ranked.This game contains steam achievements and steam trading cards.This game contains Cash Shop items and with last patch, can be considered PayToWin in unranked modes since you can directly buy chests containing cards, that make the abilities of your champion stronger compared to person not having the cards. Summary Paladins, that was a decent alternative to Blizzards Overwatch, being a fun MOBA with nice competetive scene has been ""broken"" by Hi-Rez last patch. Sadly, most players were warning the developer not to bring out the patch to live servers but they still did and it shows their attitude towards their players base. As you can see on recent ratings and reviews, such attitude should be the death of an online game developer/publisher. If the player base starts to dwindle to a matter where they start to listen to a community again remains to be seen.In the current state I can not recommend Paladins to anyone due to technical issues the game experiences, disbalancing in terms of cash shop in unranked modes aswell the attitude of the publisher towards its customers.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game.

Others I play with crash during gameplay and sometimes even sitting in the menu.Prepare to do a lot of fapping while you wait for the deserter countdown.It's free 2 play, so you really have nothing to lose trying it out.

78a1a805-e903-4028-ae96-e74e49ef5d0c,4,"Early Access ReviewSo, as far as the gameplay is concerned Paladins is actually pretty great. Fast-paced, great hero roster, almost all of them have cool kits and are fun adn easy to play. It's relatively balanced and succeeding requires skill. The OB64 update actually isn't as bad as people say it is. It's only hillariously unbalanced and a little pay-to-win if you play Unbound game modes where your character's card levels go from 1-10. You can just play Bound game modes where everyone's card level is set to a maximum and minimum of 4 and it's fine. However, that's where my praise ends.Don't let it's Free to Play status fool you. It's technically free, but realistically $20 if you want to play all the heroes from the get-go. You start with a small number of them unlocked permanantly and a few in ""rotation"" that you can play for a bit and keep your progress for later before they get locked again when heroes rotate. You can buy all of them with ingame gold, but you'll average about 100-200 a match when most of them are 7,000-12,500, which is a lot of grinding. Unlocking them all would take hundreds of hours. Just hope you don't see a hero you like that's not in rotation, spend your hard earned gold on it, then immediately find out you hate it (I did that with my first unlock, Evie). By the time you've bought one or two that $20 pack is going to start feeling like a good investment versus GRIND GRIND GRIND.Speaking of grinding, the wait times between games is much longer than any other online FPS I've ever played. Parts of their matching system is pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Entire games will be dropped regularly becasue some moron forgets to ready up or pick a hero and you have to go back to searching for a game.But here is where my main crticism lies: cosmetics and the ""loot box"" buisness model. I love the cosmetics they make. When they're good they're great, a lot of them are pop culture refrences like turning a tank hero into an anime mecha or turning a sniper hero into bounty hunter Leia from Return of the Jedi. But Hi Rez handles them horribly. First off, pretty much all the cosmetics you can earn through normal play are terrible for how rarely  they drop. Most of them are just minor recolors that you can barely notice. You can technically earn some good ones through spending 'VIP', an alternate currency earned like gold at a MUCH slower rate. Let's say you earn something like 20 a match and 25 more from a daily quest, then some of the skins bought for that cost in the tens of thousands. You'll never realistically get them without spending real money. Their paid currency, ""Crystals"" sometimes drops for quests, but 4 at a time once a day if you even get one. So an uncommon skin that really isn't that good takes about 15 days to grind for, and one of their paid chests takes 75-100 days for a single random set for a single random character.And don't spend real money on chests. Ever. Instead of just simply being able to directly buy a cool skin for a hero you play a lot, you have to pay $5-8 on a chest that with a random chance of dropping a set. So you drop your money on one and you get a skin for a character you don't play or might not even have unlocked. You're paying real money for something you don't want or may not even be able to use. And those chests do drop duplicates, so you may be paying real money for something you already have. Why does Hi Rez do this? Money of course. Keep paying money for a tiny chance at getting something you actually want. There is a reason some European countries are having talks on wheter or not business practices from games like this, Overwatch, and Battlefront II is considered legit gambling.Edit: They are making progress. Some skins CAN be purchased directly, but not all of them. Not even a majority of them. The lootbox system remain FIRMLY in place.The gumball machine loot box system is a cancer on the gaming industry. I cannot in good consience give good reviews to a company that employs such an awful buisness practice. If you don't care about all that, go ahead. Download it and get the hero pack and never look back. You'll still have fun, one way or another. My reccomendation is still overall a ""No"", just not a super-hard never play this game ever kind of no.",Tue Dec 28 23:42:59 EET 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469
9ee474c8-3ee7-4cff-abaa-a1d06fed65f3,6,"Early Access ReviewAll thought the resemblance to Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch is still pretty big, the game itself is so unique that we can't consider it a spinoff. It's amazing how tactical strategies created using cards to buff yourself/allies or debuff enemies is used to make you stronger or sneakier. It's one those rare shooter games in which strategies can really turn the tide of battle. Yes, other games you can *act* strategically, but with all the customisation in this game, there's a massive difference between shoot everything without a second thought and think before you act. What's more, the characters all have their own unique personalities, some more humoristic than others. My favorite character, Pip, is even more powerful than he is funny. This game is a HUGE recommandation to people who enjoy humour, liked TF2/Overwatch, or don't want to get either games but looking for something similar.

Since before you needed to grind to lvl your champion (and you) now you can grind to lvl your cards too, Join the ""grind"" Family on Paladins! I'm sorry but I dont have the time or the money for it, I'm a bit disapointed that I waste 20â‚¬ on the founder's pack, to end up stop playing, dont get me wrong, I loved and enjoyed the game even with some stupid bugs that even now its not fixed. I still think that this new OB64 was a way for them not to fix the previous bugs and glitches. ""Why bother fixing the previous bugs, if you can create a new and ""better"" mechanic for the game that may or may not fix them and end up being with even more bugs?"" Not to mention that the game is in Beta and isnt that supost to be to fix glitches and add new stuff, not re-design a new game mechanic, if you wanna to add this you should do it on Alpha, thats why its called alpha...Ok, I'm all over the place... long story short.

Avoid like the plague, boycot their company, uninstall everything Hi-Rez, and demand refunds for any in game purchases, not even No Man's Sky can compete with this.The wall of text begins here:On a bored lonely evening shortly after getting out of the hospital last christmas from nearly dying I stumbled upon Paladins as a ""Recently added to steam"" suggestion, bored and tired of all my current games I said ""Why not?"" and downloaded it. Lo and Behold, I was instantly hooked, SO HOOKED in fact that I played it every day, morning to till night while I was in post-surgery recovery, and even developed a website for the game that aided players in gaining useful information about champions and loadouts. I played this game religiously and it quickly soared past Arma and DayZ in my ""hours played"" list.Slowly along the way I purchased the founders pack, realm pack, and VIP because I loved this game so much I felt Hi-Rez truly deserved it for giving me the greatest blend of all of my interests, a shooter game, an objective game, and a fantasy spellcaster style game in an arena. It truly was the perfect concoction to me. Slowly I started playing less here and there as I would get burnt out as one always does, but then even still I regarded this game as one of the best things to EVER be put on steam.Then came the news of OB64...No longer would your card loadouts be selected and you would be able to distribute points to upgrade the effects of the card you apply those points to, instead you'd get every single card for free, but the catch is, each card would have individual levels that you don't get to choose to apply upgrades to, instead, you'd have to pay in game money to purchase a chest and get a chance for that chest to drop a duplicate of that champions card to apply levels to that randomly selected card. You literally cannot even spend gold to level up a specific card of your choosing, it's all entirely random. You can also pay real world currency to purchase in game chests which gives literally anyone willing to drop a couple hundred dollars into the game the most unfair advantage imaginable.No longer is this game free to play. If you don't want to get absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing decimated, you have to either have been such a long time player (like myself) that you have obscene amounts of in game currency on standby, or you have to buy into the game to level up a champions loadout and hope that you even get the things that you need leveled in the first place.I am absolutely ashamed that I ever spent a single dollar on this game. I'm even more ashamed I devoted time outside of the game to developing things for the game and it's community who is equally as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as I am.

You could experiment with various loadouts using 12 point system building loadout and it was fairly balanced, there wasn't big or small disatvantage. Depending how you built your loadout, the only thing that could make you overpowered is that you outsmart your opponent with that loadout. Nevertheless, the game lost it's customization now. I palyed it a lot, sometimes few games a fay just to lash out. Now I don't have all the cards leveled up max and I don't plan to play against someone who does in unbound more or on other modes where cards are locked on lv4 because it's not much. If I wrote this review before OB64 came out, I woul've strongly recommended you to play this game because it was very customizable with it's cards. For f2p player I don't have time to grind whole day just to get chests so I can level up my cards. If you are new f2p player in this game I recommend you to not play it because it's gonna be extremely hard for you to progress. You won't have all champions unlocked and it may force you to buy that founders pack, which is their goal now, I guess, and you won't have coins to level up all those cards. It'll just take too long.The game was super fine up until now and I don't think the game needed this change.

07fe7ed1-c56b-459d-b1d9-ee8c437f93bb,10,"Early Access ReviewWith the introduction of Cards Unbound, this game has immedietly went straight down into the toilet. Nothing feels fun, anymore, as this game slowly becomes a game for damage mains, and nearly no one else. Every character now feels like a damage dealer, if you can't do good DPS, get out of the way. New champions are starting to make themselves feel less and less unique, and less and less fantasy like; almost feeling like they belong in your generic shooter, in addition to many champions feeling extremely lack-luster now. Nerfs feel like they're done haphazzardly, and buffs are bland and generic. Most nerfs are the reduction of mobility and nothing else, whilst buffs are nothing but increased damage.The game used to rely on good positioning and strategy, now it's starting to feel like the game is slowly becoming a game of who can do the most damage first. And this, gets really old, really fast. The addition of the fourth legendary card only helps to enforce this. Most of them go for making a character deal more damage, or making it even easier for them to do damage. While some of them are unique, most of them are really bland, and can easily go. The whole thing of Cards Unbound feels heavily rushed, and feels like there was no care going into the production of this update. Cards Unbound is only splitting the community further than it already is, if ther was a split to begin with, and no one even asked for these changes to the game.EVERYTHING AFTER THIS WAS WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING THE GAME IN LATE APRIL! IT WAS HEAVILY DIFFERERNT THAN WHAT THE GAME IS NOW. THIS IS BEING LEFT JUST IN CASE HI-REZ CAN CLEAN UP THEIR GIANT MESSBeing a lot like Overwatch, this game still holds its place with where it stands, but from what I've seen from playing it, a lot of things still seem to feel rather un balanced and, most of the times, almost cheap. I can't really give this game a positive score or a negative one, as, while it is rather fun, it's almost always infurating to play at times due to not being able to switch the character that you are playing during the match. While some may say that this is a good feature to be having, I think that it's, in all honesty, not that great, due to how unbalanced some teams may end up feeling within the first minute of actually playing.Much like TF2, this game can easily leave you with a sour taste in your mouth. There's no actual voice chat, from what I've seen, and the ingame voice commands feel as if they'd take a good week to learn to begin with. In addition to all of this, the menu itself just feels kinda off, and definitely takes some getting used toIn the end, I still can't really give this game a good review, or a bad review. With the 5 on 5 matches you have, teams can really be unbalanced in the roles of the characters, and with the skill level in general sometime, although, that can still apply to anything. If you've yet to play this game, with what I mean about the unbalanced factors, is that your team may end up feeling like a game of TF2, where you have 8 or more spies on your team. And if you haven't played TF2 enough to experience something like that, I'm honestly rather surprised to say the least. If I were to give this game a score, it'd have to be a 7/10. Mainly due to the balancing that has been put in place, and how unfair it can be. Most games end up being a one-sided match, and that's not fun. I've only played a handful of matches that felt fair for both teams, those were fun.One flaw I definitely see with this game, is character balancing, and hitboxes in some cases. Some characters in this game, in my opinion, ruin the game and only make it fair for the person playing them. These tend to be the flankers from what I've seen. In addition to this, some characters, in general, just seem to be a lot better than others, and make some characters in the game useless, as they can easily counter many characters the game has, and don't really have counters to them.The game is free, and I recomend playing it if you want a fun experience, but you'll probably grow to have a love-hate relation with this game. As some things kill you before you can respond, and some ults don't seem to work the way that they're intended to, which is rather silly (much like the flankers, which I've found one of; in my opinion of course.) This is, again, all my opinion however, so you can feel free to feel however you want about this, and the game itself.",Thu Aug 05 23:07:02 EEST 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

47d8e697-81ef-455f-a6a4-b682c294a01e,2,"Early Access ReviewI played 35 hours ,unlocked ranked and then ran out of steam ( bored of the gameplay ). I will say the game runs awesome, if you have a low end PC it will run pretty dam good. It's free so there is absolutly no excuse not to try it out for yourself. I think the reviews are a little inflated, the game is not groundbreaking and does not bring anything new to the table.The card system which allows you to customize very slightly how you want to play a character is very underwhelming, might aswell not exsist in the first place. Along with that the way this differs from games such as TF2 is that before the round starts you can look at the opposing teams line up and pick items that you believe might counter their picks/items. Unfortunatly this also falls very short, the items are boring flat bonus's to damage, healing, mitigation, reduced cooldowns or stealth detection, there are more but really all are very mind numbingly simple which might excite a new player. PRO's + The Matchmaking worked pretty well for the time i tried it, everything went smoothly.+ Game runs really well, they did a really good job at making this game available for everyone!+ The game play is simple and easy to pickup.+ Some interesting characters like Grover, but most are very average. + Play with friends and group up if you like. + Ranked play is unlocked after you gain hours playing 12 characters upto level 4 which teaches people how to play.FIRSTLY - The game uses a Third party launcher, i installed BEFORE i knew this. If i had known it had a third party launcher i probably would not have installed it in the first place. CON's - Unfortunatly the gameplay is too simple, lacks depth. If you like the complexity of games such at DOTA2 this is the complete opposite.  I'm not comparing those games, just putting it into perspective in how shallow the game actually is. - The characters are bland and uninspired, cheap. They are so generic you really don't like any of them, so unlikable. - The maps are very basic. TF2 even has some roller doors that go up and down and some effort here and there, the best way to describe the maps is like playing an FPS inside World of Warcraft style graphics.- The card system needs huge sweeping changes, more risk reward and less passive dribble. - The items you actually spend money on are so ugly. They need more appealing models.- Cant communicate with other team i don't want to be hand held. - Character abilities are also average. Yes, it's not like we haven't seen a bomb go down and everyone needs to run away a million times before.Actually the list goes on, but i will simplfy it for you.Download and try it if you don't mind installing yet another installer and account, you have no reason not to, it is in BETA and things will probably change, but unless it gains depth i wouldn't waste time here. Go play some TF2 if you crave action in a 16/16 server which plays all day with no matchmaking, no waiting and lots of players.I will make sure to edit this review as i play more and as the game changes / grows in time.",Fri Mar 20 10:46:43 EET 2020,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

Also, the game has been in beta for over two years, and its likely that they wont drop the beta tag due to using it as an excuse for the MANY bugs in the game, which they refuse to fix. But who cares about fixing bugs when you can have an insane amount of microtransactions, am I right? Like, I have watched countless pro tournaments for this game, and I am not joking when I say that literally every non LAN tournament ( and even some AT LAN TOURNAMENTS) have had game crashing bugs, which makes it awkward for the casters so they have to find some way to play it off.It's such a shame, this game was fun.

26a73e65-e41b-4cf0-9152-e2e6bfbe24b3,6,"Early Access ReviewYeah, this is definitely a poor man's Overwatch. Since it's early access, it's still very lacking in many things. Currently, there's only one game mode that's basically Overwatch's hybrid mode with control point instead of assault. There's also builds and boosts here, so that's a slightly different addition compared to Overwatch. But again, there's still so few things here, so it might get dull once you've unlocked 2-3 characters and got a bunch of stuff that seems already half of the game's contents.Do give a try. It might feel like a ""bootleg Overwatch"" at first, but once you've played a few games and tried out the characters, you'd realize it's quite different from Overwatch. Really, just try it, it's free. That's a good point, isn't it? Being a f2p game?EDIT :Oh, and I forgot to add a little bit about the game. I don't find it appealing to have a launcher launches a launcher that asks you to login into another. Robocraft have a ""login with Steam"" choice, but it doesn't exist here. There's login with Google and Facebook, but when you disconnected, there's no choice to login with Google and Facebook, just ""login with your Hi-Rez account"", which is kinda annoying because you'd have to close the game and reopen the launcher again.EDIT 29/01/2017 :It's been awhile since I last played this game. I can't play it anymore because their EAC blocked me away with that error 10011. I looked around for solutions, and there's so many solutions that I'm not so sure if there's any of them that can work on my PC, or it might destroy it instead. It sounds so technical that I decided to just sit here and wait until they fixed it. Because logically, if there's some sort of settings or files that need to be or not to be there, they should put it along in their package to begin with. Or at least give a notice as to what might cause this happening, but since there's nothing at all, my patience is getting weary.

815d2e9a-4213-46bd-996a-0ccc4d9f8b35,7,"Early Access ReviewUPDATE: Post OB44OB44 introduced a new game mechanic called community hate. Basically the developers tried something new with the games current BETA status and unlocked a new deadly adversary, hate. So what was new to the formula of Paladins? Legendaries: To newbies this introduced a slim learning curve, I would not say that this posed a great threat, and especially how people made such a big deal out of it. It just alters the base play style of your champion, be it easier to push in, deal more damage, get around faster. This is not harming the game but tailoring it more to how we play. Maybe someone play aggressively with Drogoz, so they get the 50 % more damage card, or prefers to use their spit ability to push the enemy off the point. For veterans of the game, there was no need to get upset, most of us had the gold to buy chests and get enough essence to buy the legendary cards we wanted. For new players, this poses no threat and introduces no Pay to Win model, you still rely on skill and team communication. It's as if one person complained and without thinking majority got on the bandwagon and joined in with their pitchforks. Hi Rez even rectified the new currency and made adjustments to the cost of legendaries and upped the gain of essence, bottom line Hi Rez listen and are active with their community, don't take that for granted. I wrote a review very early into my playtime, and by far this is one of the best FPS Free to Play games out there. So lets break it down.Free to Play:No, you can't pay to win, to be honest you can play this game without every spending a dime. You can unlock all the champions with very little grinding, if you even call just playing the game grinding. Comparing to Overwatch:Those people who compare this to Overwatch and call it a cheap knock off have not played this game at all. This is no where near Overwatch there are so many key fundemental differences. This game is in fact more fun, more broken(at times) than Overwtach. Hi-Rez constantly pushes out updates which in most cases improve the game, and best of all this is still a free title.Graphics:Man this game can run on anything, no matter your specs it will push this title. Hook up your moms favourite potato to some live current, hook that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up to an external monitor install steam.exe and you will enjoy Paladins.Mac can run this, and by run I mean you would get 30FPS+ on mostly low settings 720p on a MacBook Air, which lets all be honest should not even be able to run Solitaire on Ultra Low settings. A decent Mid Range PC build will push this game to High with 100FPS, not bad. The overall graphics is nice and clean, nothing spectacular, but nor is it as ugly as my aunt. Sound:Well what do you expect, you can hear it all, everything is clear, and chaotic, just listen closely to hear when someone is using their Ultimate and you are about to be the next victim. General Gameplay:This is a nice game, I like nice things, it is fun, a lot of fun. It just does not loose its appeal that fast, make sure to drag a buddy into this one, as this makes for a much more enjoyable experience.The game is about to launch its Season 1 of compettive, and boy oh boy Paladins is about to chnage again, however a gripe is, where is the in game voice chat, I dont want to type my life story out before every match. Where is the love?Community:You will always get those try hards, you know, those guys and gals who have been founders of this game since the first sprite made, ignore them enjoy the game. But word of advice maybe play against AI for the first 4 to 5 levels of a champion just to get the hang of them. All in all, this is a nice game, we all like nice things, you would be silly to pass up on this amazing deal of 0.00, it's a steal right now.The game gets a out of .",Sat Oct 23 15:10:09 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

815d2e9a-4213-46bd-996a-0ccc4d9f8b35,4,"So. I loved this game when it started. Now, however, the devs have changed around multiple times the way the payment system works. Items that I bought with real currency are no longer in the game, things that I grinded to unlock are now available for a few euros and the card system I built up was completely changed around as well.The devs don't seem to set their sights on something. They added different in game currency twice, switched things around gameplay wise multiple times and now try to sell you both a VIP account as well as various season passes. I ""bought"" this game by paying to have all current and future characters unlocked but now sit on a pile of gold that only serves to unlock characters.The game itself suffers from major optimization issues. A GTX 1050 4gb, albeit modest, doesn't run it ""smoothly"" when I play some AAA titles with graphics on high. Controls are clunky, servers get slow, it simply feels un polished.Having spent over 30€ on a game I actually liked, only to see it developped in a terrible way, is infuriating. I keep getting back to it, playing a bit more, and instantly regretting my choice. Old champions are now useless compared to some new ones, some are unplayable due to reworked mechanics, and newer champions always seem more OP.I wish I could just permanently delete my account to stop going back to it for a few hours of deception.But, hey, I knew the publisher was Hi-Rez and I knew they don't care about their player's feedback. Perhaps that's why the multiple emails I sent to their customer support went unanswered.Steer clear, go play Overwatch. I liked the card system in Paladins and the fact that you can't change champions in the middle of a game. But, it really does feel like a poorly developped game now.Edit: after months of emails and so on, I only get radio silence from the devs. I will not get a refund. Take this as a warning.

Let's take a look at the final version of their take on the burgeoning FPS genre.Screw the establishment, man! Oversized publishers that don't move with the times are so old hat. The cool way to publish games is to be a lean operation of a couple of guys who haven't been able to afford a YCMA shower in a week who release games like Paladins for almost free and grow beards and hang out at coffee shops and have documentaries made about them. Fight the power, unless they don't give me a freebie review code, in which case they're a bunch of pompous asses.Hey, this is different. It's nice to see a solid, well presented and very playable game of this type appear without the usual hype and fanfare, and get plenty of attention for its gameplay rather than its sexy heroine or Hollywood guest stars. The Indie team have have made it work.Set in a wartorn part of the game's fantasy world, the game hands you the task of shooting all the nazis before they shoot you. Some of them are tougher than others. Some need to be shot in the head or the leg before they die, and some cutscenes show you feeling bad about it. Over the course of the game you will have the choice of over 4 weapons and your character has a great rack.Paladins tries to seperate itself from the pack with interesting features.Paladins was designed mainly as an online experience and it's pretty easy to set up and play. The game automatically logs in to the required server and all you need to do is find some other like minded players to join in the fun with. Enemy AI is strong, but come on, who plays solo these days? Multiplayer is a breeze to get going, and playing against another human is always a far sight more challenging than your PC could ever be.From the moment the impressively lit intro scenes start you know you're in for something special, and the actual game doesn't disappoint at all.Additionally, there is no faulting the character animation on display.It's a testament to the graphical prowress of that hot new graphics card you bought for an exhorbitant amount when its in the hands of the experienced team at Indie.The 3D world of Paladins comes to life in a Anime way, which is nice if you're a fan of the genre. The animation-quality visuals are a wonder to behold which I wholeheartily recommend to all..Game of the Year contender?

4414beef-989a-4634-939a-46381fa6f973,9,"Early Access Review Opening Paladins, a more skillful alternative to overwatch. Paladins is a great game that is action packed and will make you want to come back for more. At first glance I too was a skeptic of this game, merely writing it off as an ""overwatch coattail rider"". Despite that I decided to try it out and see the appeal of the game itself. I was not disappointed at all. The game seemed much more fresh, the movement better, and the characters much more hilarious. The game felt more balanced to me as it doesn't justify characters being overpowered / too good for being brainless because they have counters. While there are characters in this game that are better at taking down certain other characters than others, The characters are balanced around one another pretty well without having the game feel like an endless rock paper scissors match. My only real love for overwatch was induced due to the hype. I went into this game having low expectations, and I continue to love this game and prefer it. I now rarely touch overwatch unless a friend asks to play. Opinion I feel that this game has a lot more potential in it than  overwatch  has. In  overwatch  you can die over and over to no fault of your own, or you can carry a team on your own. In  Paladins  you are much less likely to die to bs, and more deaths in the game are due to something you may have been able to do better, or something you just did wrong. I much more like  Paladins  having existant challenge in it when going against people, where instead of switching character to counter the enemies you're having trouble with, you can't swap and have to rely off of your own skills, and character to beat them. In  Overwatch  Knowing a pool of characters well is important, but in  Paladins  it feels more rewarding to do so, as you have more time to get used to using a character, thus allowing to have more familiarity with a character and their playstyle throughout a whole match. Reasons I like  Paladins   Community is better and generally less cancerous than  overwatch   mainly due to it being smaller. The  Paladins  developers listen to the community more for balance changes. More reliant on skill and higher skill ceiling due to the lack of character swapping. Gameplay is slower paced than that of  Overwatch  , but comebacks can still happen in an instant. Better in game movement, and more usage of movement abilities, as well as much more focus on movement itself. ",Wed Aug 18 06:53:59 EEST 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a
4414beef-989a-4634-939a-46381fa6f973,7,"Early Access ReviewI enjoyed this game for quite few hours, but I just can't take it anymore, nor recommand it.This game had a great start. It got popular when it went to early access and recieved generally positive feedback.Even though champions and maps were somehow limited ,( well, it was ealy access anyway ), the gameplay was exciting and fun.Now, what happened. As many other games ( free ones mostly ), the developers focused their attention on ingame micro transcations, floeded the game with skins ( A lot which are ugly or just a recolor) . Don't get me wrong, they have done many bug fixing but it was obivious that they want to grind the game with more and more skins. Note* : skins are only cosmectic, and therefore has no effect on gameplay.Now to a more serious part. The high rez app is totally trash. They force you to install when downloading paladins. (why the hell does steam exist ? ) .The more funny thing is that  it leaves services active in your pc after uninstall (hilarous).Not to forget they are using now Easy Anti-Cheat.

Paladins already had you fighting uphill in the beginning (if you didnt have a Founder's Pack) and this patch has just made it worse. HR has taken away a necessary stream of gold by removing it from the Chest's, gold earned through matches just isnt enough to allow free players to catch up (locked Champions cost 5000-7500 gold a piece). Theyve made Champions considerably less versitile and killed what little semblance of balance the game had with Legendary Cards. Add this onto one of my poorer PUG experiences in a game and I can no longer justify giving it my time. It was fun enough that Ill check back to see if its playable again but right now I cant recommend it. ",Mon Aug 30 00:02:46 EEST 2021,7538609a-a5e1-47e9-9b84-f27b650d683c

3394eb98-29e3-4e56-9585-9d50314b440d,8,"Early Access ReviewPaladins is a hero shooter like Overwatch. There are a lot of people accusing Paladins of being a clone and inferior to Overwatch (OW). Well from a guy that played both a lot (in overwatch I have around 150 hours maybe?) they are different, and this is gonna hurt a lot of people, i find Paladins better than OW and here's my humble opinion.-First of all one thing that i dislike in a lot of games and I am sure others do is the meta. Overwatch follows a strict meta that gives little to no room for diversity. In Paladins it feels like every hero is balanced and none lacks anything. You have a much bigger choice of what is considered viable here.- With this statement above comes in mind the updates. Overwatch sees a meaningful patch every 3-6 months and maybe even longer. I moved to OW around 7-8 months ago. In the period up until now there have been 2 new heroes so not a lot to shake the meta out of its stagnant waters, whereas paladins has seen around 6-7 new champions from that time up until now.-Another thing that bothers me a lot is the community. In OW it seems that every player either think he is pro and always right or he doesn't care about team communication rather insta locking his favourite role. You may think ""OW had a system that let's you change champ on the fly"". Well yes it has, and that makes it all the more worse. In Paladins you have the traditional ban a hero and each player waits his turn to pick. That makes it so player have to at least communicate with each other or at least complete the roles ( this paragraph comes from my experience playing 80% of my matches in OW as a support cause I had the courtesy to wait during picks).-And lastly about the gameplay. Paladins has a shop and a card system whereas OW has nothing like this. That means you can change, to an extent, the playstyle of a hero.Don't get me wrong, I like both games but it seems that to me imho Paladins is better. I would say it is more player friendly that OW. The other thing I would like to make clear is that this comparison doesn't come from the need to prove which one is better. One cannot deny that a lot of people compare the two games as they are pretty close in gameplay. This is mostly a review/answer to the whole debate from another point of view rather than explaining the mechanincs and the gameplay as people seem to have a rough idea about this. My focus on meta is linked to the quality of fun I will have as a player. For me, the meta in these kind of games seem to shackle/narrow the potential of that game.",Sat Jun 26 02:51:31 EEST 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c

c9e7b13f-a8e9-479f-975f-88c09f5585e9,1,"Early Access ReviewI do not get how people can enjoy this game. Really, I don't. I usually do not say it like that, but: This game is bad. Really bad. And nobody know where it is heading or what it will be in the future.The balance is probably the biggest issue this game has. Some champions are always ultra strong, some are useless on certain maps and so on. The way the champions work has been changed several times and no system seems to make any kind of sense. Why can I just craft rare cards? Why can I craft every card?The maps are always the same. The modes are always the same. It is always 3 ways that are seperated by 10 metres. That's it. The servers are horrible. I had so many games now where sudden lags and even freezes appeared. And every player had these freezes. But one has to ask oneself: How do they make money? I mean, if you take a look at the skins, you gotta ask yourself: does anybody buy them? Do I really need to buy a skin that turns a glove from slightly olive to slightly brown? Hair that turns from black to red? Those are not skins. Colors should always be free. Nobody should charge anybody for a slightly darker rubberband in the champions hair. The overall gameplay itself is pure hectic and most of the time: chaos. But that can easily be explained. The matchmaking is to blame. In most games, you choose a champion and enter the matchmaking. In this game, you enter the matchmaking and when the pre-game starts, most players simply click on their favourite champion as fast as they can so that nobody else can take him or her. That is utter bullcrap. This way, most of the matches you will join will have horrible comps. You rarely see support classes and when you see them, the enemy has 3 of them. That is no matchmaking. It is a randomization system that creates chaos in the game.The gamemodes itself are boring and always the same way. Push a payload here, push a payload there. What is most annoying is the winstate situation. Your team can win by capturing the point, that actually spawns the payload, 4 times. You don't have to push it to the end. You can just start it first and you will win. That means, the team that has a tank will most likely cap the point and win. While the other team, that needed 4 DDs and one support, won't cap at all. I mean, how lame is that? If implement objectives into the game, the players should be rewarded for finishing them. Not for starting them first. All you get is more chaos in the beginning, when everybody rushes to the point.The champions, not speaking about the balance, are lame as well. They are not innovative, not original and not interesting. They are just cartoonish, trying-to-be-funny characters you have seen somewhere else. You will not only think of Overwatch, but Team Fortress, Jak and Daxter and other ""sources of inspiration"". The part that stinks the most is that at some point, the ""new"" characters became rip off's of other Paladin characters. 2 characters with assault rifles. One male, one female. The same for the hunters. Everything looks and feels like an old sandwich. It is not special, not interesting and not funny, even though it tries to be all of that.Why is that? I asked myself. And I believe the answer is: Because the devs do not know what they are doing. If you look at old videos of Paladins, you will see that the siege mode was interesting once. But they changed it. And now it feels like they took several steps backwards. And that keeps happening. They had a half-decent card and skill system. But they changed it. Now they have a new currency, just like in Hearthstone and the same craft/disenchant system. Why? Why do they keep adding stuff that is clearly taken from other games instead of rather creating what they had in mind when they first started to work on this game? Everything in this game is flawed. Everything. Even the countdown timer when the match starts is flawed. I do not understand how people can actually play this game more than an hour. Only because it is free? Well, come to think about it: It is not free. You pay with your time. Every time you look at the ""press ready"" window and witness that one - always one - player does not press ready, you lose another minute of your life. Only because the matchmaking is flawed. Every time you start a match and suddenly get a crash that brings you back to the login screen, you waste time. Don't waste your time on this. And if you do, don't waste your money on this one.Edit: Even the uninstaller is flawed. After uninstalling the game, the HiRez updater stays on my system. Nothing in this software works as intended. Nothing.",Mon May 24 02:43:00 EEST 2021,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

There are 4 types of champions to choose and each champion has his / her unique special skills or abilities. You can also buy special ability like increasing damage or life steal etc. with the credit you've earned that match (starting with 400 credits at the beginning of the match). To win the game, you have to push or resist the payload which will give you points. The team with 4 points win the match. Eazy breezy!Anyway, the only problem I've been facing almost every day is that the game kicked me out so often (some days not at all) due to unstable server, I guess.

The point is if a game, any game, keeps introducing new premium mechanics (not to be confused with premium cosmetics), not for long they will run out of space for 'premium mechanics', therefore, they would have to rewrite the whole mechanics for more money (which Hi-rez did).And from the fact that Hi-rez prioritises on making money out of premium mechanics, we can see that we won't be able to play the game we'd installed 3 or 6 or 9 months ago. Of course, you could say it's in BETA, it has to be developing, but no, it would not work like that since Hi-rez will be pushing updates that do not concern with the development of the game but rather just for the sake of 'developing' and money. And there is an example of this; the OB64 which majority of the player disagreed with update (roughly 74.28% of the player) but Hi-rez was still pushing out the update, because it's on Christmas period so if Hi-rez didn't push this update they would gain little to no money.tldr; I'll just leave it like this, there are lots of things to be explained. But if you like the game just try not to invest on it that much because Hi-rez would just force another new mechanics anyways, which may or may not look like a premium one, but it is a premium one because no one wouldn't be updating something that doesn't make them money.",Sat Apr 17 23:55:22 EEST 2021,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

It's all pretty standard.Some time ago there was also a survival mode where everyone had just one life, but they removed it for some reason. What it already has is decent enough, but it could use some more varied ways to play and have fun.There's no real lore or story here, unlike other popular Hero Shooter/Moba games, just some one-liners and jokes to give the colorful cast some character.But it doesn't need any, in this type of game, it's all about characters and gameplay.The characters are hit and miss, but that's just my opinion. They all offer something unique to the table and are fun to play with (Unique in regards to this game and its characters. You will find a lot of parallels between Paladins and Overwatch or TF2.)There are also plenty of maps to play with and much more to come (with the being available to players for testing, which is a nice idea, involving the playerbase into some part of the creation of the game.) all of them being colorful and generally well designed.Of course, there are still a lot of glitches and broken elements present, but it's understandable as it is still in the Open Beta, and the developers are constantly working on it, throwing in patches after patches, changes, and new content.It's amazing to see. Especially recently, when they were introducing new Champion every single month.But then, Cards Unbound happened...A new patch that basically threw away the unique loadout system that differentiated it from the other Hero Shooters, allowing the player a lot of customization of Hero's abilities to suit their playstyles while still being balanced, which was easily the best part of this game...And instead they put in a system that not only removed all the balance from the game modes where the vast majority of players are, but also turned the grind up to eleven, making it really annoying for the old players, horrible for the new ones, and more Pay-to-Win than it was ever before (and the funny thing is, they've decided it was a good idea to announce it right after the StarWars Battlefront 2 afair,) pretty much forcing the players to use what they get from lootboxes rather than building the loadout they want... so they wouldn't get destroyed all the time by players that have all their cards maxed out without any limits.To be fair... I didn't really test those changes for myself, so it may be that I misunderstood some mechanics of it, but in any way, it's blatantly obvious what they're trying to do.It's really sad and disappointing, which is why I won't be giving it any more of my time, despite the game being fun.

The game play is pretty great with a lot of different classes of champions. I personally like the different skins that each champion has, but for one thing that Hi-Rez change on an update was that took out the head or hair feature of the avatars. Hi-Rez is always changing Paladins to fit the needs of their users. Some of the UI can be change around if you need be, but I do have one gripe about the HUD is that you cannot place where you want it to be. For instance I would like my health bar at the top left corner rather on the bottom left corner.There are 2 things that can be improve with the game. First, it seems that the doesn't update as fast after a match. It noticeable if you are grinding for gold and it doesn't update correctly. The game is pretty small, so reinstalling helped out.

They have their similarities but are two quite distinct games.Positive:- Lots of different champions to choose from.- Champions loadouts are customizable, essentially changing how you play the same champion.- I like the inclusion of items. Allows you to react to your enemies better.- I enjoy the addition of mounts -> it changes game dynamics and you can force people off their mounts.- Games are fairly short (5-20 minutes).- Team interactions and combinations is exciting and fulfilling when properly executed.- Frequent updates and new content (maps, champions, skins).- I like that games cannot be won by simply defending the payload. You must capture the objective to win (allows for comebacks).- Different game modes and you can play on test maps.Negative:- No 'undo' button when buying items. Made a mistake? Too bad.- Occassional hacker (haven't spotted one in a while)- Like any online game, uncooperative teammates can be frustrating to deal with.- Matchmaking is not always fair.- Occassional bugs, lag-spikes, and downed servers.- Requires some grinding (like any other MOBA)Conclusion:Remember, Paladins is still in open-beta. It still has a lot of flaws, but I believe the developers are working hard to improve this game. In the end it comes down to this: do I enjoy playing Paladins? Yes. It's free, so why not give it a try?If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my curator page and group. Your time and support is greatly appreciated!

4bd4917e-8292-4c4e-aa64-89a11b14aa70,7,"Early Access ReviewThe game turned out to be surprisingly good. So far I'm enjoying it much more than Overwatch.First of all, Paladins seems much more skill based. There's more actual shooting and less ability spam (all cooldowns are pretty long, and you won't be able to use heroic abilities more than 2-3 times in a match). The enemy hitboxes feel like they are the same as the character model, so you need to actually aim instead of randomly firing at the enemy team.Moreover, while the game is certainly team based, a lot depends on each of the players. Going 1 vs 5 is usually a suicide, of course, but it's quite possible to deal with 2-3 enemies solo. Sometimes I even managed to defend a point solo against the whole team, but I believe this is because people still learning what different champions can do.In regards to the heroes, they do seem similar to Overwatch, but again, many of them remind about TF2 and other shooters. Thankfully, not a single hero is exactly like in other games. Yes, the abilities are the same, but they spread out across different champions. For instance, sniper in Paladins has basically the same weapon as Widowmaker, but the rest of her kit is different. Instead of mines she has mini-turrets similar to Symmetra's ones. She also has a teleport, and her heroic ability increases damage to the upper body (including headshots). On the other hand, Victor here is basically the same as Soldier 76, but doesn't have auto-aim ult (again, more skill based) and heal.Technically the game is pretty good for an early-access/beta. I had a couple disconnects, but all of those were before a match, not during it. And there were a few mini lags in matches, but nothing game breaking or infuriating. Optimization is also pretty good: getting stable 60 fps on maximum settings with GTX 760. Which is very important since the game is very fast paced.I played only a few hours, but overall Paladins feel like one of the best online team-based shooters out there (and I am not talking about f2p trash).Anyway, if you wanna try the game, you can add me as a referral so we both get bonuses for playing Paladins. Steam doesn't allow publishing links, so another way to do it:Social > Referrals tab > Add Referrer > Log in > Type referrer's nickname (mine is Esmer).",Mon Nov 22 03:38:37 EET 2021,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051
4d1243e6-9836-45a1-87d3-7911fbc1806e,4,"Early Access ReviewHi-Rez Studios new game Paladins joins the convoy of modern combo games called hero shooters. Its most well known representative is Overwatch. The review system is full of reviews stating Paladins are ""poor man's Overwatch"" mainly due to its free-to-play nature, but I will focus comparing this game to some other games. My Overwatch playing experience is VERY LIMITED and you may haven't played Overwatch as well, so you wouldn't know what I am comparing the game to.Paladins is free-to-play title available in open beta (currently in Early Access) since September 16th. It pits team of five in small arenas. Game is played in rounds, with the score limit of four. Rounds are timed and during one, you have two phases - first one is to capture the single checkpoint which is being done by standing on it. Once the point has been captured, the payload will appear and you need to push it (stand next to it) to other team's base. Whatever you do in game awards you score points - capturing the checkpoint, successfully pushing the payload within time limit and stopping the payload from being delivered. The rules are as simple as they can be and you're gonna learn them in one game round time. The game starts with players choosing their heroes. There's a variety of different heroes with different abilities. Just as with MOBA games, some of these are rather easy to control and some require dedication and practice. By default, current version of Paladins unlocks 7 out of 16 available heroes for players to use. After choosing the one that shall kill and die, you have several seconds to pick any optional skins and customizations for your hero. These are all cosmetics and they don't influence the game mechanics in any way. Each character, beside its primary close range / long range weapon, has  different set of abilities which must cool off before you can use them again. This, of course, reminds of MOBA concept because it is basic MOBA's element.Before the game starts, you get a chance to pick your five card deck. Now, this is pretty interesting concept and I can't remember seeing it in any other game (Does Overwatch have it? You tell me). As you play the game, you will be unlocking numerous different value cards which can be combined into 5 cards decks. Decks must be built prior to matches, which means you will only get to pick a deck, not individual cards. Each card represents different ability, so it helps you customize your characters even more. So far, I've been experimenting with cards and I have to say it's a hit-or-miss concept, meaning I've felt a difference with some characters, but not with others. Cards are definitely a ground for Steam economy implementation, but let's hope Hi-Rez will stay out of it. Beside collecting cards, during your stay in 'base', you get a chance to buy different abilities called items (also known as Burn Cards, if you will). These are generic and same for all the characters. Concept is well known to MOBA players, but simplified in this game due to its frantic nature and existence of cards system. Game servers are choke full. During testing phase, I've never waited in queue more than 20 seconds to join the game. Never. Meaning, be it game or night, there are players playing it. Of course, this and game's F2P nature guarantees frustrations hitting the roof when you're pitted with incompetent players who disobey the concept of teamwork. Game offers casual matchmaking, ranked matches after you level up several of your heroes, practice against AI and training ground which unreasonably keeps you from trying locked heroes. This is a real issue at the moment because it forces you to judge which hero to unlock solely on other people's gameplay experiences. So far, as I know, there's no weekly hero rotation that lets you try different heroes. As for its visual style, Paladins fails to impress me on the same level Overwatch did. Graphics are solid, yet the idea seems totally uninspiring. Critters, AK47 wielding quasi-Russians, stereotypical dwarves and shotgun carrying monks, the complete concept looks like team went through some great brainstorming sessions, yet failed to mold their visions and ideas into something coherent. For example, previous Hi-Rez game called SMITE delivered a truly great concept of ancient gods fighting each other which was followed by equally great work in the fields of concept art and 3D modeling. On the other hand,  this so-called fantasy-sci-fi setting has 'jack of all trades, master of none' written all over it. And don't be fooled, even 60 dollars game such as Overwatch are suffering from the same problem.Microtransactions are available in the game. The game is totally skillbased which means you can shoot, miss and dodge bullets. Micros are being used to unlock additional heroes, skins and mounts. Basically, all you really need to spend your money on are heroes. Two currencies are available - Crystals are buy only currency, but they can also be unlocked as consecutive logins award and, I presume, via special promotions. As for the Gold, it can be earned solely by playing game and leveling up. All but a latest hero cost 5000 Gold or 200 Crystals which means you will need to level up 10 times to afford a hero. With 7 heroes (or Champions, as they like to call it at Hi-Rez) available, it should prove to be quite an easy feat.  Similar economy has been implemented in Hi-Rez's SMITE. In case you'd like to take a shortcut, an outstanding Founder's Pack is being available with 14  price tag. It unlocks all current and future heroes plus grants you with additional exclusive awards. It's an awesome deal if you bite into Paladins hard enough.For what it is, an Early Access game, Paladins feels smooth. Hit detection seems to be a bit off when it comes to some heroes. Lack of some effects is making you guess whether you hit your enemy or not. For example, Champion Fernando's burning attack doesn't set a victim on fire, so you never know are you dealing any kind of damage and since Fernando's a close encounter Champion, you're always at risk.The best thing about Paladins is that it is not as time consuming as MOBAs, yet it is fun as FPS team shooters. Matches last for 10 minutes tops and that's the real amount of fun I want and need from a game. Finally, when it comes to comparison, I'd like to say I see Paladins as a bastard child of Team Fortress 2 and SMITE. It really is, those two games are what almost instantly sprang to my mind after few Paladins matches. The goofy graphic first person shooter in which you escort a payload meets MOBA style gameplay with different heroes you can customize. See? I told you.So far, I've been having fun with Paladins. When the game turns bland, and it occasionally will, I'll know we had some great time. It's a summertime boyfriend/girlfriend. ***Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it?

AFK spam it with drogoz/evie/willow while eating grapes. you cant lose. other rounds will  consist of people shooting you off your horse so u take years to get to middle... its just the same stuff over and over again. i had fun, but only up until i recognized all these flaws and just cant take it anymore.. not when i know how much better the game used to be, so thats it for now ... back into the depths of my steamlibrary",Thu Nov 11 17:05:16 EET 2021,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103

Although you seem to see a ton of negative reviews for this game they seem to be far from the general perseption of the game, in fact this game plays very well. I personally have not played overwatch but I would imagine that Paladins at least stacks up decently with it. This game has amazing visuals and very smooth gameplay. Moving and using your abilities just feels natural and intuitive. The only con I can even remotely see in this game would be the community. Now you don't just pop into a lobby and have a kid screaming over his headset its more like you wish you would have at least someone whos talkative. This game is very much based on teamwork and with the lack of communication it can be hard to plan.

10c3ae55-59ee-4f19-8081-6faa7507ddb8,4,"www.mkaugaming.comPaladins: Champions of the Realm is a Free-To-Play title from Hi-Rez Studios. It began in September 2016 as an Early Access game and is now in full release. Hi-Rez Studios have started making some huge growth in the Free-To-Play field, with titles such as Smite, Hand of the Gods and their new successful title Realm Royale.I will be honest from the start and state I was sceptical going into this title as these styles of games have failed in the past to keep my attention. For some out there Paladins shares a lot of ideas and creations similar to Overwatch, and for me that game wasn’t to my taste. That is not saying it is a bad game, just not my style of game. I Have nothing but respect for that title and the hard work that went into it and can see why it is so popular but as I said just was not for me. Well Paladins taught me a huge lesson.This game is just so much fun, having friends to play with is a huge advantage as it is a very strategic game and requires communication. Picking the right Champions is also a must, as they all have their advantages and disadvantages but getting the right balance is a game changer.  The game itself has so much to offer but does require you gain enough experience and in-game currency (gold and crystals) to unlock these. The base game comes with 5 characters and an additional 4 that are rotated every two weeks. I am reviewing the Deluxe Edition which includes all the current DLC available. There are 37 champions (playable characters) to enter the battles with, these are separated in to four categories.•Damage•Flank•Front Line•SupportAs with other titles in this genre it is recommended you choose within these guidelines to have a strong team, but it is not required. As I mentioned before it is a team-based game and requires you all work together and choose the right team to gain that advantage in battle. All characters also have cards you can customise in your own loadouts offering their benefits in battle but require a lot of learning on the job so at times it can be a strong learning curve. The champions have their own levels you can increase with gold or battle experience offering unlockables as you progress but there is also an account level to show your overall progress across the game.There are several game modes available, but the two I found the most exciting were Team Deathmatch and Siege. TDM is self-explanatory but Siege begins with both teams rushing to the centre on their mounts to capture the Payload and push towards the opposing teams base. There is also Ranked Matchmaking, but this requires at least 14 unlocked champions and reaching account level 15. But do not go into this lightly, as most games are against teams that are well adverse in the workings and strategy of the game. Hi-Rez Studios are doing great work to continually keep you coming back, with events, new characters and unlockables. The current event Rise of Furia is so intense, requiring both teams to race to the top of the Demonic Spire while the Abyss Rises but it is not as simple as it may seem. With you being required to jump across platforms (warning some do fall) and small chain links making each step possibly your last. Once at the top it is an all-out team deathmatch battle with great atmospheres and entertaining cut scenes to set the story for the event. Alongside the event are unlockables in keeping with the style and story of the event.Paladins is a game I highly recommend playing, not only is it fast and frantic fun online it also offers so much for those gamers that enjoy the glory of showing off their hard work through their unlockables and rank. The game runs so smoothly on PC and that extra FPS gained from PC Gaming makes it so much more controllable when aiming and keeping your surroundings in check. The sound effects and music are so well presented and for me the title music alone is a hard-hitting rock soundtrack that just sticks in my head. It is Free-To-Play so what is stopping you from checking out this gem of a title. Honestly, I will continue to play this on a regular basis (free time permitted).

Paladins is a fun to play game, they make changes every week - 2 weeks, some of them being bad BUT these devs look at what the community hates and then just changes it back for the community. Paladins even added a community-made skin to the game, which is very awesome because not many games engage with their community. The game also never gets boring because of the playable champions and the customizable gameplay (Cards / Items) that just makes unlimited gameplay possibilities.

I have a little over 500h in this game, and maybe 30-40h are this year.. for a reason.Overall balance wise it is terrible, no balance changes are made in the champions and currently there are the same 10 champs rotating in the competitive, normal games are mostly for trolls. The review is mainly from a Solo Q competitive point of view. The game pretends to offer different playstyles and champions, but you can expect to be flamed for anything that is not a copied Pro build in competitive.Pros:- Free, not P2W. You buy crystals that you use to buy skins and boosts (which are rather ugly compared the SMITE ones, by the same company)- Decent graphics - a bit wooden and choppy. - Can be enjoyable if you have a group of 4 other friends and play as a team.Cons:- Toxic community. Competitive is literally unplayable. There is a certain ""Meta"" seen from the Pros and everyone copies and expects certain builds or champions to be picked. So if you are looking for a challenge and playing different champions / playstyles.. go to other game or 5ppl normal games.- Balance issues everywhere.. certain champions are insanely unbalanced and either you will never play them because always banned, or you will get to play them and just smash everything for a boring 5 min stomp.- Game is still Beta (although it is more than a year after launch) so bugs and weird hitboxes are expected.Conclusion:If you are competitive and you want to have a challenge and try out different styles - it is not the right game for you. You can stick to normal games and try different champions and builds but the trolls will always get you.",Sat Jun 12 06:17:59 EEST 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

Characters are more loveable and friendlier than in Overwatch, i hope we get more lore and backstory about them! Especially for Fernando and Mal'Damba!The card system is one of the most interesting thing in this game for me. You can make playstyles for yourself! Don't like that ability which has long cooldown? Just get that card which lowers it!Do you want add an additional attribute to your weapon? Pick up a card which adds that! It's awesome! Of course it's balanced, so spend those loadout points and choose those cards wisely!Unfortunately it's in the beta, has so many bugs and has less maps but I think they will add more stuff later. Another con is that there are script kiddies already which is very bad but even that cheating program, they can't really win, only with a decent/good team!That's all for now! Thanks for reading my review and I hope you give a chance to it too! Maybe, I will add more stuff to my review as time goes.Edit (2016.12.28): The Hi-Rez Studio support team is awesome! They totally earned my respect from me. If you get any serious problems (I had one where I didn't get crystals which I paid for), just go to the support and they will help you!Edit (2017. 11.23) Updated because of the free xp but let me add something:- It's still a very good team-based multiplayer game but the updates add a lot of bugs which may be fixed in a week of if we are luck in the next day.

4301361e-4123-4a0e-bc36-da28232698f5,6,"Early Access ReviewHiRez may very well have fixed the glaring issues with OB44, but I'm going to leave this review as it is for posterity.Once upon a time, this was a fun game. back when I started in early October, I found this game to be a nice reprieve from the typical fast-paced, low time-to-kill shooters that one tends to find. I remember all the fun things like how Drogoz could fly at sonic speeds, and all the bad things like Skye's inescapable time bomb. I still flinch a bit when I hear the phrase ""Time's Ticking!"". Unfortunately, time and time again, HiRez have shown that they intrinsically do not care about people having fun. Drogoz' speed limit was the first sign that things were going downhill for me. Instead of incorporating this fun little exploit into his kit, HiRez insisted that everybody has to sluggishly hover about in midair, becoming prime prey for all the hitscan champions out there. This, of course, is the wrong way to go about things. Multiple developers have taken quirks in the code and blown them up into full features, like rocket jumping in Quake, or the genocidal warmonger Gandhi in Civilisation. To me, this change just felt like HiRez were becoming the anti-fun police.Last month, they introduced a new champion, 'Maeve', whose arrival significantly shifted the game's dynamics. Whereas most flankers can be easily dealt with if not caught off-guard, Maeve is so stupidly agile that hitting her is nigh impossible on a champion that doesn't have constant hitscan weapons, not to mention the effective HP that she has from all her health regen cards and her insane damage output. However, the biggest issue with her is that she has rendered Skye completely and utterly obsolete. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to play as Skye anymore. HiRez have killed a champion that his been in this game since the closed beta, yet they've gotten away with it.And now, we've just gone through the 'Season 1' update, wherein they may very well have just signalled this game's death. Firstly, they did not sufficiently test this update; the developers promised a second round of testing on the public test server which never came. And during that sole round, I found that choosing the champion Barik would cause the match to never load up. How have HiRez solved this? By just disabling the champion.And then, there's this god-awful crafting system that they've just introduced. Prior to the update, you could just go ahead and buy cards with the gold that you can grind in-game, but now, the only way to get cards is to unbox them or use 'essence' to purchase them. How is essence obtained? By getting dupe cards in the chests. This makes the game incredibly inaccessible to new players, as they are completely dependant on RNG when it comes to creating a new loadout, and keep in mind that there is 22 champs, with 16 cards each. That means that there is a 1/352 chance of getting the card that you want.Or, rather, it would be that, if there weren't also emotes, poses and sprays in this chest, further decreasing the probability of getting anything useful, never mind the 66 legendary cards, which were just introduced, that can severely change the way a character plays. Now, here's something interesting; before the update, people extrapolated from the costs of the standard cards that legendaries would probably cost 10,000 essence. Despite this being used in calculations all over the place, HiRez decided it would be a good idea to make them cost 18,000 instead. It costs 792000 essence to unlock all the non-default legendary cards. I, a person with most things unlocked, probably average at about 1,500 essence per chest. It is inexcusable how the game has locked away playstyle customisation, one of the game's selling points, behind what is essentially a paywall, since you're going to have to buy boosters if you want to grind for gold, or even just directly pay for the chests.And that's just about the game itself. I could probably go on for a while about the general attitude of the members of the dev team that hand public relations, like one particular fellow who called people that didn't like the old Time Bomb 'noobs' (despite it being a guaranteed kill in a massive range), and how he seems to have disregarded all crticism on Reddit since it's just a 'hole for whiners'.I've seen this level of greed kill a fair few games in my time. I don't want Paladins to die, but at this rate it is going to die a very unceremonious death. Of course, it wouldn't be HiRez' first failure. Just look at Global Agenda and Tribes: Ascend.",Sat Jan 23 04:20:39 EET 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

It used to be that supports could actually hold their own against flanks rather than instantly being melted in a 1 v 1, but the game has gone in a burst meta direction with decreasing TTK, which I find absolutely unfun. Design decisions since then have been all about locking in this burst meta, with characters like Cassie being consistently overpowered but not being adjusted for the sake of selling skins. This is beyond mentioning how often bugs are introduced, particularly with the new patch cycle, that remain unfixed.

93ce4f02-6ea6-42f9-9c6c-dda77fcd35e0,4,"Early Access ReviewWhat was once a great game with layers of complexity, fun and exciting gameplay and an amazing community is turning into a shallow grindfest. The game has been progressively dumbed down during the latest patches (with many mobility skills nerfed and direct damage buffed), bugs are frequent and it doesn't look they will be fixed anytime soon. The devs seem hell-bent on churning out new content (champions, skins, etc) without taking a break to fix the bugs - some of which have been around for months or even a year. Expect drops, crashes, and bugs that mess with your rewards (bugged drops, etc). At this poins the daily quests are broken completely, so you won't even get your rewards for playing the game. Want to unlock stuff? You gotta pay. The final nail in the coffin is OB64 though. Once that patch hits, the game will turn into a proper sh*tfest. The complete overhaul of the cards system will not only remove the complexity that made the game stand out against OW (how you could tailor every champion's build to fit your playstyle) but will also make the game completely P2W. New players won't have a chance against those that have stronger decks - but prepared to either play insane amounts of time, or shell out thousands of bucks (no kidding) to unlock the cards you want. (Not to mention it will be based solely on RNG, so you won't even be able to choose the stuff you really want.) No, thank you.It is really sad that it has come to this since I had immense fun with this game for months. (997 hours played in total.) It used to be a really fun (if somewhat buggy) experience with enough depth to keep it fresh on the long run. The champions are generally fun to use - that includes supports too -, the community is amazing, and the customization options made it so that I kept coming back again and again to try out new builds.Hi-Rez dun goofed (it's not their first time - see Tribes for example), and I cannot fathom what they were thinking with the past few patches, and, especially, the upcoming one. I'm just sad for the devs that worked hard to bring us this game. I wanted it to work, but someone, somewhere, messed it all up with their stupid decisions.Steer clear for now - even though this was once a great game, the good times are sadly over.",Wed May 29 00:30:58 EEST 2019,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

93ce4f02-6ea6-42f9-9c6c-dda77fcd35e0,10,"Early Access ReviewHey everyone!Paladins, a game which most things you hear about are bad things. However, most of the bad things come from people that have never played paladins before. They’ve only seen someone play it. Let me just give you a brief explanation of the way paladins works: paladins is a first-person arena based hero shooter. That’s a mouth full right. Although there are a couple games that, by just looking at the genre, are exactly the same. You know which games I’m taking about. Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 (and maybe battleborn but I’m just excluding that one because that’s the least played of all of them), and to be honest, they have a lot in common.They are both shooters in which the goal is to capture an objective or escort a payload. 2 teams batteling against each other from 3-6 players (amounts differ between games). Those players each select a hero/champion/class which has different abilities. Although they share the same base, they are far from the same. I am most going to be talking about paladins compared to overwatch since nobody seems to call paladins a tf2 ripoff (which it’s not by the way). The exact goal of paladins is to capture an objective in the middle of a symmetrical map. You do that by standing on it. You’ll gain 3 percent per second for standing on the point. Once a team reaches 100% capture they get a point and spawn a friendly payload. The goal of the team that spawned the payload is to escort it all the way to the enemy base. The goal of the opposite team is to do, you guessed it, the exact opposite. They have to prevent the enemy from escorting the payload successfully. If the escorting team escorts the payload successfully they get a point. If they do not, the defending team will earn themselves a point. This process is repeated until a team reaches 4 points. Matches last from about a short 7 minutes to a long 30 minutes, depending on the skill variation between the players. I find myself match up against opponents around my skill level most of the time although the matchmaking system can still be improved. In overwatch, and I’m taking about competitive, the goal is for the attacking team to capture an objective and then escort a payload. The goal of the defending team is to prevent the attackers from completing their goal. After time is up or the attacking team has successfully escorted their payload to the very end. The teams switch sides and the process is repeated. Only the attacking team can earn points. They do that by capturing an objective and escorting a payload. The team that had the most points after the time of both teams is up, wins. Now of course these game modes seem alike, however, they play much differently. This is mostly because paladins also has a lot of aspects that a MOBA usually has.In paladins, unlike overwatch, you cannot switch character during the match. Also, if you play a hero in overwatch, and someone in the opposing team plays the same one, you play against the exact same hero with the exact same stats, damage, cooldowns etc. In paladins however, you do not. This is thanks to 3 systems. Loadouts, legendary cards and items. Loadouts are sets of cards made by the player for each champion. A loadout consist of 5 cards, each card giving a buff to one of its abilities, his weapon or his armor. Loadout cards have 4 levels, each level making the buff a little better. A loadout card at level one uses one point, cards at level 2 use 2 etc. You can have a maximum of 12 points in your loadout. At the start of a match you can choose one of the loadouts you’ve created. You can also select a legendary card, which, just like a loadout card, gives a buff to one of your abilities or your weapon. However, this is a massive buff that will change your playstyle of this champion completely. There are 3 different legendary cards for each champion. Some cards may be better in different circumstances which you’ll understand by playing the game. During the match you earn credits. Credits is a currency you can buy so called “items” with. Items are, just like loadouts and legendary cards, things that buff your champion. What makes them different from them though is the fact that items are the same for every champion. They don’t buff your ability or weapon, but they buff another stat. You can buy 4 items in every match, 1 of every category. There are 4 categories: defense, healing, utility and offense. Defense cards containing buffs like damage reduction, healing containing buffs like life steal or extra heal from teammates, utility containing buffs like reduced cooldowns or faster ultimate charge (yes just like overwatch paladins also has ultimates), and offense cards containing buffs like faster reload speed or more damage to shields or deployables. These items are level one when purchased, but can be leveled up to a maximum of level 3. Level 3 having 3 times the buff of level 1, but costing 3 times the credits as well. Credits are gained passively, which gives you about 2 credits per second (different from each game mode), but they are also gained by dealing damage, contesting or capturing a capture point, contesting and escorting the payload, dealing damage, kills, eliminations and healing your teammates. These 3 systems are what makes paladins a completely different game than overwatch. And of course they are alike. Some champions have the same abilities and stuff but that is because those are just common types of abilities in a game like this. I have played both games and I have enjoyed both a lot. I still play both overwatch and paladins regularly and love both of them. Paladins is a little buggy though since it’s early access, but you’ll get used to it. Also paladins is much friendlier to slower PCs. I have a very bad pc with intergrated graphics and no graphics card and i can run paladins at maximum settings at 60 FPS or higher. With Overwatch however, I can only reach a maximum of 20 FPS with minimum settings. This might be because paladins is a little less detailed than overwatch but blizzard can still definetely work on some optimizations.Sorry for making my review so long and maybe boring but I hope you have a good look on the difference between paladins and overwatch now, and why neither of them should be called a ripoff of one another.Thank you for reading,And yes I recommend paladins if that’s what you came here for.",Fri Nov 26 00:02:40 EET 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

f974812a-6855-4fee-8dc3-cdc13e59e9b2,3,"Early Access ReviewOkay, so let me get this out of the way: Yes, I play Overwatch. Do I see the similarities, hell- even the BLATANT character knock-offs? YES. But the question is: Does Paladins do enough to separate itself from Blizzards Hero based team shooter?YES IT DOES.This game is awesome. There are still a lot of kinks and seeing as it's still in beta I can forgive that. I'll separate this review into a couple different chunks.TECHNICAL:1. Okay so I have yet to have Paladins straight crash on me. I run an i7 4790s, 12GB RAM and GTX 1060 6GB. The game runs fairly well. However, my roomate runs an AMD FXsomethingsomething (octo core is all I know) and a GTX 1070 and his game crashes CONSTANTLY. It can get pretty annoying and sometimes just makes him quit altogether. I don't know if it's because of the AMD processor or what have you, but that's pretty much the only difference we have in our builds. So, I'd have to say the game is more optimized towards Intel builds.2. Framerate is good. Again, this is based off my build. I play with all settings maxed out and I'm getting my full frames - no dips or anything like that. It runs off a 32bit directX9 engine and I can see how that would help a F2P game be playable on many different builds. 3. There are small hiccups - like sometimes I can't put down a spray, sometimes I can only spray on the floor, sometimes only on the walls. Weird but not important enough to annoy me.4. Some characters are much more effective in their classes than others. I love playing Ash [Tank], but if there is a Torval [Tank] on the enemy team, I'm done for. She just doesn't put enough damage in. 5. PLEASE PUT THE CHARACTERS CLASSES IN BEFORE THE CHARACTER LOCK IN SECTION. I'm new to the game, and there's no way for me to tell that certain characters are Healers or Front Lines or Flankers because the game won't even let you hover over those characters to tell what they are because somebody chose them. It would really help with team composition.GAMEPLAY(The classes go as follows: Front Lines [Tanks], Flankers [MOBA-like assassins], Damage [Offense based] and Healers [ahem... they heal]. All of these characters can mostly hold their own. And the cool thing is that the healers can actually do a lot of damage compared to OW. I know, the comparison to OW is going to be annoying but you have to understand that these games are very similar in nature.)1. The characters kits are fantastic in Paladins. I have so much fun playing every hero. These characters play a lot more like MOBA characters than Overwatch. The Ultimate abilities can really sway the tides of battle because of the MOBA-like skills. For example, there are characters who produce MASSIVE knockbacks and can win the match based on that alone, or others that completely blind you (save for like 3 feet in front of you). It keeps the game interesting and honestly - it can be much more tactical than OW.2. I like the gamemodes, but they are similar to Overwatch's gamemmodes with the exception of Onslaught (which is basically king of the hill and only lasts 1 round). Otherwise, you're pushing a payload after capturing the point.3. The hitboxes in this game are very large compared to other FPS's. Sniping is much easier to do, but it still requires a fair amount of skill to do well in. You don't have to have precision aiming to be effective at most heroes and to me, it helps with the fun factor.GRAPHICS1. There is definitely not as much shine in this department, but again - it's because of the way the devs tried to allow many different types of builds play. Especially lower budget builds. Nothing wrong with it though as I like the art style.2. [THIS MIGHT TRIGGER SOME OF YOU BUT IT NEEDS TO BE SAID] Some of the character designs kind of look stupid and are blatant copy and pastes of other games. Like Ruckus looks like Bolbi Stroganofski from ♥♥♥♥ing Jimmy Neutron stuffed into D.Va's mech. Viktor looks like a Guns of Boom character had sex with the brute from TF2 and plays a lot like Soldier 76. Sha Lin is Hanzo without the dragon ult. Drogoz is Pharah with an ult that auto-kills one hero. Bomb King is Junkrat. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing Ultimate is Junkrat's except that YOU are the riptire. Kinessa is Widowmaker with a different ult. And don't even get me started on Barik. I mean, he shoots LAVA out of his gun, builds TURRETS and sounds JUST LIKE TORBJORN. Fernando is Reinhardt with a flamethrower.PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THOUGH THESE CHARACTERS ARE SAMEY, THEY CAN PLAY AND MUST BE PLAYED VERY DIFFERENTLY, AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT ANGRY ABOUT IT.Overall, Paladins is a fun game. It's balancing needs to be addressed and matchmaking is hit-or-miss. I've been playing this over OW and I'm having a blast. Don't let that ruin your enjoyment for an overall great game that deserves praise as well. ",Tue May 04 21:10:27 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

The person with deadshot aim is no more valuable than the person with the decision-making ability to know when a well-timed ability will turn an engagement, or the person with the map-sense to find the optimal locations to place sentry turrets.

The sound is always broken, the layout occasionally gets into some spagetti codes and decide to crash on its own. Fun aside, I see the developer have been trying nothing to improve the game these past years. Granted it's free, unlike Overwatch, but instead of blaming the always-existent bugs on the game being free itself, the developer seems to have no plan of trying to focus on improving this game or the games they deem to be the main title of the studio to appeal the base customers (being the cheap gamer I am) and get them decide to spend money on their microtransaction ingame. Look at League of Legends for instance, another free-to-play game, as well as many other splendid free games out there, at least they don't mess up the sound ingame. So my advice for the developer is to focus on one or two games that can be sold (Smite also has potential but still), instead of trying to impress by like dozens of trash game that bring frustration to people around the worldTl; dr: Nothing has happened (""happen"" as to have a slightest bit things that can be called improvement) these past 2 years since I knew of this title, and unless your PC is like 10 years behind the norm or you have absolutely nothing to do to kill time, don't pick up this game.

8d401567-e5a3-4fdc-91e6-3c5e968e0af7,9,"Early Access ReviewThis game takes an undisputable spot amongst the best free2play games out there right now. It is a very fast paced, competitive FPS and not pay2win for one bit. I dont care about comparing it to Overwatch so i wont make any comparison with it, both games do have their similarities but both games play out very differently, period. Paladins have its own unique features to make it stand out clearly against its competitors.About the game, first off i would like to point out that the Founder's pack, right now on sale, is very much worth the money. It grants you access to every champions right off the bat (that for some, you would have to unlock with gold and crystals (special currency you can either buy or earn legitimately by playing days after day) along with all future champions to be released, which is in itself pretty cool, but also 20 Radiant chest granting you each 3 deck cards (i will get back to this) and a rare chance for a piece of cosmetic (gun, costume or head gear).The game graphically looks smooth and runs very well, no need for a super fancy machine to run it at high settings, i myself have 150fps on max setting with an i3 GTX 770 which is not top notch hardware by any means. Although the level design can feel a bit dull, the layouts are on each map wery well done providing flank option, choke points, elevated positions and such. Also, relating to the only game type available as of now, the maps are symetrical. What does this means exactly ? Well, each team has to first capture a zone in the middle of the map, once this has been done by either one of the teams, the payload spawns for the team who successfully captured the zone, turning the game into attack/defense. Score a point for capturing the zone, escorting the paylord to the enemy base or preventing the payload from going into yours if you are playing defense. Get 4 points for your team and you win the game. Now in this scenario, the spawn timers change to balance out more to allow the attackers a chance to push the payload all the way the the enemy spawn. Orignally set at 10sec for each team during the capture phase, it switches to 8sec for the attackers and 14sec for the defenders, allowing the team attacking to cross the entire map. Of course all of this is subject to some tweaks in the future since its still only a beta.So onto the card decks now, each level you gain with your profile awards you one radiant chest, giving you 3 random cards (getting a card you already own is a possibilty). Right now each champions has 20 distinct cards, each deck you build (up to 5 decks) contains 5 cards of your choosing, giving you extra passive abilities, either related to the champion's abilities or just generally other abilities related to the champion's gameplay. This is a great thing to make your favorite champions unique and more suited to your own game style. Also it is good to point out that you can directly buy the cards with gold (1200 which is quite cheap) and gold ONLY. You can buy chest separately for 20 crystals, but i would recommand to save those to buy either new heroes (if you dont have the Founder's pack) or cosmetic pieces for your favorite champions.In the beginning of a match, and in every round you can choose what card deck you want to use, on top of that, there is four types of cards you can buy for each match (common to every player and separated from the card deck). Starting with 400points (points you earn by playing the objective and eliminating foes) you can buy one card each of 4 types (Defense, General, Healing, and Offense) upgradable up to level 3. This all adds another layer of customization well appreciated.All in all, this is a very fun game that i can only recommend if you are into this type of gameplay. Its free so theres no strings attached, if you're skeptical about it being a ""clone"" of Overwatch, just give it a try a you will see it is not. This game has a ton of potential, theres is no doubt a lot more content will be added in the future, whether it is new champions, maps or new game types",Wed Sep 08 07:17:09 EEST 2021,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

However, it is free and you get what you pay for. Don't expect too many cosmetics out of this game. I am not a big fan of the sound design either. Kinda feels empty compared to OW.For ranked play, OW does it better. While Paladins has a great ladder system in place, OW has faster queues and an actual variety in game modes. Yes, you only get one ranked mode and it's siege and kind of a PITA to play if I'm honest. This is why I can't go too long in ranked in this game. Just too tedious for me.I recommend this because hey, it's free. The barrier of entry is a lot lower, so you might have more friends that play this game. Furthermore, I like the loadout system.

Also if you had mastery on a character before the update, you cannot get chests you missed, which means mains (I had one for each class) are struggling a little. Anyway, thanks for your time, and enjoy your duo queue, and I hope that you have more luck than me in solo queue.Now for OB64. u trashed game (i have also put a little edit ^ about masteries on characters) as it was very good, however now the game is unbalanced, previously you could think out builds for characters and get the specific cards, but now you have to pray to Rengesus for loot, and trust me you wont get loot - e.g. i wanted upgrades for malice and fuel for the fire on hin, however 4 chests later i have gained very little strength on them.

However, the recent changes to the Card Mechanics has left a nasty taste in my mouth.The Card System allows you to power up your character and their abilities in various ways depending on how you have them loaded into a deck of 5 cards.Previously, the Card System was great.  You collected the cards and then put them into a Deck where you adjusted the Card's Power Levels until the Total Power was 12.  Now, while you get all of the cards, you have to collect more cards to power them up, just like Units in mobile games such as Clash Royale.Previously, you could buy the cards directly with In-Game Currency or obtain them or certain cosmetics in Loot Boxes.  Now you can only obtain the cards in Loot Boxes.Until this change is reverted, I have very little desire to play any more Paladins.

8cf50f9e-467c-48fc-9bf3-7b4483f3c183,1,"Paladins... sometimes overly exhilarating and tense, fun and addictive.But...Also excessively toxic and annoying at times (many times to be honest).However, once you get used to the game's many faults, you begin to appreciate the game more, or, like many people, you drop the game and never touch it again as if it has the plague.Most of the characters are pretty fun to play and each offer a varying style of gameplay that is very fun to get used to and master. This shows that each person has a character that they get used to. Many people call this a free Overwatch clone, I, in my personal opinion don't care at all, the people that say that just don't appreciate it (I'm going off on a tangent here, oh well...).The music is not really all that important in this game, unless you're sitting in the main menu for the next hour or so.The lore of the game honestly provides a deeper backdrop on the characters and their motivations for joining the Paladins in their fight against the Magistrate, which in turn makes a player more appreciative of the game for providing fun info on each character and giving them a sense of reason and existence for them fighting against the enemy.The community for the game is... uh... very colourful, I have to say. They can range from being the nicest person in existence to the most vilest scum in the universe that deserve to die in a fire and then get thrown into a vat of boiling oil. However, I hope this helps you make up your mind on getting this game (this FREE game), because it's truly worth your (non-existant) money (except for Premium stuff that you really don't need, take it from me...

7f280fa6-82f9-411a-a038-e335595a1237,8,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a real joy to play! All of the characters are unique, from a guy who uses a sword drenched in fire to launch flaming projectiles, to a lady with a magical crossbow who has a pet bird, and to a giant bomb king who throws his loyal bomb subjects at you. Actually, that last one sounds a lot like Kind Bomb omb from Mario... anyways. Most of the characters are relatively balanced with very few being bad or overpowered. The gamemodes are a little lacking though, all there is is team deathmatch and a mixed gamemode of where you capture a point and then push a payload. The hitboxes are huge, a lot bigger than the character's ingame models. This has upsides and downsides to it. One of the upsides is having a bigger hitbox means it's easier to hit people and thus easier to play the game. The downside to this is that since hitboxes are so big most of the time large characters end up being bullet magnets due to their size. And you can rarely get shot through a wall because your hitbox is clipping outside of cover. The game auto-unlocks a few characters for you to play, and you can unlock all of the other characters with in-game coins(which is relatively easy). Also, certain locked characters have a limited time rotation where they become temporarily playable by everyone. Overall this game is easy to get into the groove of playing, but still has a high skill ceiling for people who want to take things more seriously. Also, IT'S FREE!!!",Fri Sep 03 21:00:16 EEST 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

You start off with a few champions to choose from, and can use the gold to unlock new champions.It CAN be a lot of fun. However... 1.) There are a quite a few of hackers using wall-cheats and aimbots. Hi-Rez does little to nothing to improve this.2.) The promise of rewards that you don't get is very frustrating. When I have a list of goldrewards of say 10 x 2500 - 5000 gold, it is simply frustrating, even infuriating to see that you have a grand total of 7000 gold or even less. It does not give you the reward it promises,3.) When you finally get a reward, like a spray, it's either bugged/not working or you have to buy a battlepass to recieve some of them. 4.) Absolute unbalanced Champions that shoot and kill other champions with one to three shots. With the ultimate ability it does make sence in a certain way, but I am talking about basic attacks that do just too much damage and even some basic attacks have an high damage AOE explosion every 0.3 seconds.It is absolutely rediculous.  If you buy the game, the gold is pretty much useless, but if you don't buy the game it's a long frustrating road where the effort, and skill is rewarded with almost nothing or false promiseMaybe it gets better if you buy it, but in this current state, to me it's not worth the money.

Cons:
- Abusive data collection, You dont need to know what sites I visit when your game is or is not running. You dont need to know if I have mods attached being a single player game.
- Boring main quests.
- Repetitive side quests.
- Characters do not have facial expression consistent with the emotions of the speeches.
- poor optimization, crashes and fps drop are constant after patch 1.11.1.

Just a AAA game that is definitely not worth the price with abusive and meaningless data collection. don't waste your time with this game.",Tue Oct 13 12:56:18 EEST 2020,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

5efcdeaa-0237-49c5-a88e-b88d1fb5b626,5,"How do I sum up 582 hours of grinding, rng, questionable updates, wierd matchmaking and Fun. Now I have been playing when this game came out to open beta and Makoa was the newest champion of the realm. I got bored of playing games like TF2 for a while and wanted to try something new. I stumbled into paladins just wanting to see what the game felt like. And believe me, the first time you played this back in the old days (OB34+, assuming you were not apart of the closed beta) the game felt like a whole new experience. A 5v5 hero shooter with M.O.B.A aspects and a loadout system felt confusing at first. But once i got the hang of things, I just enjoyed the game more and more. What really sets this game apart from its competition is the customization. You can build loadouts and design your champions in a way that feels comfortable to you. Want a frontline to deal more damage? Want your flanks to be extra durable? Maybe you want to be the fastest thing alive and run around the map like a madman. Whatever you feel like, you can build you perfect champion to be the way you want it to be. (There are limits to customizing your deck and preferred loadout, but the way you make it is your choice alone). Of course, this game is nowhere near perfect, all things aside.  This game has alot of problems such as -Bugs (some of which break the game and some wont even let you play the game at all, i.e. wont start the game/crashes on open)-Balancing issues (some champions are either too strong and too weak, and not alot of people ESPECIALLY the crew at Hi-Rez understand how to balance something properly)-Strange updates (Essence system, the infamous OB64 patch, removal of the mix-and-match cosmetic customization feature, broken champions on release, buggy/weak champions on release, events/features heavily focusing on P2P players such as the siege of ascension peak/Rise of Furia, tedious grinding (i.e. Battle Pass 1), character reworks no one asked for (Viktor), ect.)-Matchmaking Issues (large skill gap in players, often times being paired with people of higer/lower skill ranks)Despite these issues I still enjoyed the game. Even if an update was bad or favored paying players, I still had fun playing this game. Paladins is a game that (at least to me), will cease to be enjoyable. Unitl the day Hi-Rez pulls the plug on Paladins, I will never stop playing and enjoying this game.",Wed Jun 23 06:30:56 EEST 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

The problems didn't trouble me. In all my hours of playing it only disconnected about 2 times. In about 30 matches. You connect back to the game after you login so you might've missed half a minute of the game. The lags aren't too bad, just a couple of seconds. Not something to rage about. Best thing is, it's beta. People who say it's imbalance and some characters are too OP are just bad at playing.Though a word of advice if you want to play this: this isn't a MOBA kind of game where K/D is all you pay attention to. Pay attention to the objectives. You're screwed if you don't. So far it isn't P2W as you can buy everything in game with gold except a couple of skins that requires Founder's Pack or Crystals.I honestly hope this game grows big.

3d0cd7c0-6416-4114-afdc-761c782e1688,2,"Early Access ReviewWhile being a succesful competition to well known Team Fortress II, this game suffers from user unfriendly menus. As if a couple of people who know how to write down a good game but has never played one in their lives, came together and tried to invent everything that makes most other games great, from the scratch. Be it changing settings, account information or more vital parts such as joining a game or staying in the game lobby until the game actually begins. What seems like an effortless section is actually a big deal for players. Apart from that once the game starts it is fun, not an exact carbon copy of TF II but something parrallel, minus multiplayer function. This game, having a mp tag and all, offers nothing that the single player version couldn't give. What we have is different characters with different skills that creates no synergy with each other and enemies that has the same problem. So it is multiplayer as in you play against humans but it wouldn't lose from score if it was singleplayer neither. I got my hopes up for this game, it has the potential to challenge in this market and offer hours of fun time to it's players. While I personally hate the ""log in every day to earn coins"" stuff I'll be doing that for lols. Still having no idea what is there to purchase with those coins but ... meh.As my personal view ends here, I also met some other comments about toxic player community but I haven't seen them, sorry but not going to accept that. Players are so far okay, not admirably good but no where near being toxic. Just give the game and it's community a chance.",Sun Dec 13 14:11:01 EET 2020,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

3d0cd7c0-6416-4114-afdc-761c782e1688,5,"Early Access ReviewSo this gets a lot of flak as being an ""Overwatch clone"", but it really plays differently enough that it stands on it's own. I do also believe it has been in development longer than Overwatch, and entered closed beta before Overwatch, but I'm sure that means nothing to many folks out there.I wasn't super attached to Paladins initially, but the more I played it (and the more they tweaked it), the more I started to love it. I can't really say the same about Overwatch though, it's kind of the opposite there, I loved it at first, but as time goes on I'm enjoying it less and less.Now, more for focus on this and not comparing it to something else, I do really like the state the game is in now. Initially, they really tried to force some MOBA elements into it, but it's not a MOBA. This in turn, made it feel kind of awkward, and created some pretty intense snowballing (characters leveled up during the match like a MOBA back then), matches were pretty much decided by first blood, or the first team that got a few kills ahead. Since it is not a MOBA, that meant there was no minions or other objectives you utilize to catch up.  Currently, you choose which cards you want to power up before fighting in your load outs, then go into a game on the same level as everybody else, making actual player skill have more of an impact in combat, though they have added power-up items you can buy and upgrade with currency earned during your match now, but these appear to be somewhat balanced.There are some complaints about the TTK being shorter now than it was initially, but I honestly think it makes the game flow a little better. Previously it took nearly forever to kill somebody, and in turn, made the game feel a little slow and somewhat boring. The older maps also kind of played to this, they were just large open areas, with a few trees and buildings, but for the most part everything was on the same plane, there was no verticality, and little opportunity to flank. The redesigns of the maps work well with the new TTK, as there is plenty of cover, many routes to take for flanking, more verticality so you actually have to aim up or down.Overall I've really been loving the game, it has more in common with Team Fortress 2 (and even Global Agenda, though the devs have even said they intended this to be a fantasy version of that) than Overwatch. I definitely recommend giving it a shot before simply dismissing it as an Overwatch clone, as it does have a very different feel (one that I prefer) to the gameplay. I'm looking forward to seeing where the game goes, as I've really enjoyed the changes they have made, and am currently having tons of fun playing it.Also:https://www.reddit.com/r/Paladins/comments/53qusf/a_brief_history_of_paladins_as_response_to/ ",Mon Jun 14 13:19:26 EEST 2021,c73c7e7f-5f57-449a-83c7-7452c76bd103

They have an interesting taste for diversity, and many ways of deviating from the cliches of all the genres that it draws from. Plus it's F2P, and not P2W. That alone should be enough to convince you to play, but if not I don't know what will.

The absolute worst game release I have ever seen, especially for being a $60 retail-sold game from EA. Great graphics and theoretically fun gameplay, but there were/are many hackers in the game from the very beginning, as well as dozens of glitches and bugs that basically didn't/don't allow you to keep a steady flow of games going. One bug would keep you from joining game lobbies, another wouldn't save your stats and unlocks from the time you quit the game to the next time you played, another would make you have to completely restart the game... It's an overall multiplayer disaster; the worst support and forum moderator team ever.  Hardly any news is given to the players.  If they EVER fully fix these problems, it MAY be fun. But the leaderboards are useless now due to the hackers that maxed out their multiplayer level from the get-go. Just awful.

It seems to me and feels so like they've copied many character design ideas with some minor changes to avoid copyright questions and I believe (considering the available information) that Blizzard were the first one.Although Paladins has pretty interesting moba-like additions over Overwatch, I like the idea to have cards which with the right decisions can change fight and lead to victory, so this game besides the FPS aspects has also RPG elements or, lets say, ""tabletop game"" aspects, so I like such a mix. Overwatch does not have any such things (it's a pure First Person Shooter) and for me it's very funny to choose some passive skills (cards) during battle depending on how fight going and it reminds me League of Legends or Dota.This game is fun.Editing: I've played this game before the release on Steam, so the time played isn't the actual played time.",Thu Oct 01 23:43:50 EEST 2020,7538609a-a5e1-47e9-9b84-f27b650d683c

bc4f00c5-9081-4c76-8b23-24fc07490cfe,6,"Early Access ReviewI've played this game as active as I could, and I think I have the ground to write this now. Instead of straight off screaming that it's an Overwatch rip-off, I'm gonna give more or less in-depth comparison between the two, from my experience in both games.1) People who came from TF2 said about Overwatch ""It's a cluster♥♥♥♥"". It kinda is, but Paladins is even more of a cluster♥♥♥♥. So many things going off at the same time and often you have no idea what killed you. Not necessary a bad thing, I got used to it, but it's the difference.2) Overwatch doesn't persuade  you into buying lootboxes, every skin/spray/emote can be unlocked by fair grind or luck and patience. In Paladins, literally entire main menu is filled with banners with offers of buying new collections, for crystals (read: for real money), and all you can get from loot chests is crap, which is a bummer.3) Overwatch got lore. Not exactly rich, but decent, with interesting background for most characters. Paladins got nothing. Literally nothing. I don't know if developers simply don't care or if it's because game is still in beta, but right now we have no idea why these champions fight. Definitely a downside.4) Overwatch is fairly expensive, that means that more often you will get to play with mature people (who can still be childish nonetheless). Paladins, since it's free, is INFESTED with children of unbelievably small age, whose parents didn't give them money to buy Overwatch. More children = more toxicity. Right in the first few games I've seen several underage bad-mouthers with open microphones. And for some reasons, it's always russians. Looks like they are the only ones in Europe who don't know how Push-to-talk works. What, do they teach it in school in all other countries?Don't play in Europe, move to US.5) Overwatch is constatly being monitored, changed, updated, patched, (un)balances, so there is always hope that someday, there will be a point where no futher changes would be needed. Not entirely perfect, but balance.Paladins devs, on the other hand, seem to not bother so much with making changes to the game, and more concerned with adding more cosmetics. Apparently, they never heard of the word ""balance"", and some heroes are as OP as they were at the day of release, as I gathered from feedback. Screw you, Viktor.6) People are often complaing about bad match-making in Overwatch. That you can be matched with complete noobs and lose so quickly you won't get to ult once. Well, that doesn't hold a candle to Paladins match-making. Fair matches are almost non-existant. You either completely demolish the enemy or get rekt like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. 7) Overwatch is pretty polished at this point, with bugs quickly being rooted out and fixed. Paladins is buggy as hell. At the MVP screen there is one hero, and in actual highlight there is another. Missing sound-effects, camera going through the floor during said highlights... It's just not great.If you have the cash and any amount of self-respect, buy Overwatch and don't bother yourself with this for more than a few hours in total. But then again, to each their own. The game is honestly not as bad as I expected it to be, it's fairly fun despite everything I stated above.",Mon Oct 11 22:39:59 EEST 2021,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

352553a7-a249-41be-ae18-353e7f5f3dc2,9,"Early Access ReviewThis is a GREAT game. I remember someone saying it was a copy of battleborn (and they must have been serious, since they gave it a bad review), but battleborn died so fast it wasn't even funny. So let me say that is ridiculus. If anything it is closer to overwatch, but it has several differences. It has more heros (I think) and has a unique card system. The game is good because it promotes teamwork and such heatwarming stuff. It seems sorta like overwatch but it's free. So you can get the feel of overwatch and not have to pay. Besides, IMO overwatch is too easy. This game is also easy (as in it's easy to get kills) but eh.Bad stuff--Having Fernando is nearly a must for victory. He's nearly unstoppable excepting flankers, and your team can take care of those. However, PLAYING Fernando is NOT fun. Unless sitting on the payload or point with your shield up is fun for you. His gun is also very weak and close ranged, which is not a good thing for a guy who is so slow. So you won't get many kills. So you have to choose between winning or having fun, which is difficult.-Viktor seems very OP the short time I played with him. I would give him a slower reload speed to compensate for his quick damage.And that's all.EDITThere was an update and now I can't play it. It doesn't tell me why, it says there was an error and it can't connect or something like that. Anyhow, it's a shame because viktor had gotten a buff (ikr why lol) and I wanted to try him. :(EDIT: I have gottten it to work.

Simple.HiRez does not care about their community. At all.When the developers of a game receive backlash from a large majority of their community for their ""fun and innovative"" ideas as well as a post on the frontpage of IGN centered around players against the Paladins OB64 update, you would think that the developers would think twice and revert the changes or at least consider changing the parts about the update that nobody wants to see come to public release.Don't talk about this situation as if it's a matter of pride; the Paladins developer team has reverted an update before after everyone critisized it, and even so with the amount of community backlash they've gotten with the OB64 update you would think that they would at the very least swallow up their pride and admit their faults with the update. The fact that the Paladins developer team has pushed yet another update that nearly no one wanted even while the game has hit a record low in players online proves that quite simply put, the developers are not interested in your feedback, and nor are they interested in keeping Paladins alive.One more thing you might want to note is that a lot of the games HiRez has spat out in the past were fairly popular and fun to play, but the only one that still thrives to this day apart from Paladins is Smite, so I guess fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, and fool me a third time and it's about time I clean my slate of HiRez games.If you are coming to enjoy a brief time with a game similar to Overwatch but free, download Paladins.If you are downloading the game to stick with it for a long while, then you are taking a gamble.That gamble is not one I am willing to take.",Tue Apr 07 20:13:39 EEST 2020,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

Story : 7/10
There was not much story in the game and I did not listen much because it did not have much interesting story except for one episode that I do not want to spoil.
Graphics : 10/10
JUST CAUSE 3 graphics are better than JUST CAUSE 4 and it is very clear when playing game graphics makes me enjoy the game.
Musics : 10/10
The music and sounds of the game were very good, like JUST CAUSE 4, the sounds did not mix, the score was perfect.
Details : 10/10
The details of the explosions and the throwing of the pieces at the time of the explosion were very natural and very good, The physics of driving and crashing was great and natural, just like GTA IV was the physics of cars.
Game play : 7/10
The gameplay was great, it had a lot of weapons, it was good to use them all, only from one part onwards, I did not use tanks or weapons because I only used jetpack, I was flying and shooting 😐.
Variety : 9/10
There was a lot of variety, competitions and areas, capturing cities, etc. The only reason I gave this score is that from one point onwards, the areas were repeated.
Characterization : 10/10
The characters were carefully made. The look of the main character and the look of his friend Mario was very careful. If we look at the difference between Rico and JUST CAUSE 2, we will see a much clearer difference.
Optimization : 9/10
The game was very optimistic, I only dropped the frame during busy times.
Bugs : During this time, I did not see any specific bugs.
Note : The game requires a permanent internet connection, when the internet is disconnected, the game connects and bothers me.
Description : The best version of the game series is JUST CAUSE.

I understand some champions being stronger than others, but those champs should have weaknesses to some other champs too, just to make it balanced, but no I guess Hi-Rez has a really good crack pipe when they design champs and their abilities, and are just like ""yeah we got this dude he can block every single thing thrown at him, oh and when he's low health he can just go into ghost mode and heal back up to full health in like a second, and we may as well give him a tactical nuclear missile"".

And I admit unlike other games that I regret/hate playing, I actually like this game(or at least while it lasted). But with Hi-Rez's loot crate decision can't recommend it... Check out the youtuber SidAlpha since he explained it better than I ever will but I also have extra pointers that I want to give.SidAlpha's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/GreyWolf779 The video he explained about the loot crate decisions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgx6l7SCNZ8My points:1) The game is too easy(in terms of skill ofc)    With the weird hitboxes and the concept of ""hero shooters"" of picking and countering others just find it easy to play the champions in this game and that could be a good thing but the aimers can easily dominate the field and that doesn't include...2)The balance is out... Since I joined(Which was quite late to remind you. OB47-OB52 in terms of knowing the game and OB53+ of actually playing the game) The balance is bad since how easy it is to play the game and some champions are just outright  better than others it just made it a bad experiance overall.3)The card deck system is a mix(even before the loot crate catastrophe)   While the grinding make it a bad experiance for smurfs/hackers since it can take time, it also effects the casual side(especially the side that don't even want to spend a dime on the game) and in my eyes that is a bad thing since this game is more of a casual game than anything. TL:DRThe game is good for casual play but I can never see it being that competetive with the points I've given. Again, I like the game and played it casually so I might not know why this game is as ""skillful"" as people see it to where it is an Esports but I digress...Unless Hi-Rez realise their mistake and decided to withdraw the loot crate thing, I cannot recommend this game even as a casual game...",Fri Oct 29 12:20:35 EEST 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

9eee5693-69ff-4e4b-a2dd-b801c5cf5def,4,"Early Access ReviewIs it the free version of overwatch? Perhaps. But is it any less of a game just because it's free? Not one bit.After spending enough time on both sides I can safely say it makes no difference where you spend your invested hours and that either one of these great games is well worth it. But I didn't come here to discuss the differences I came here to dicuss Paladins.(NOTE THIS IS A BRIEF SUMMARY/REVIEW)First of all we can talk about how this game is still in OB, which is not a bad thing at all. They update the game regularly, (roughly every fortnight if they're productive) and introduce a new champion almost as often. They do listen to their growing community and at times they make mistakes; as we all do. Maybe adding more skins when other things are needed first is a mistake, but I'm more than confident we can overlook that.Graphics.Because of Paladins's unique style they can seem simple and at times unfinished. Probably because they are and this is to be expected given this game is only F2P and still in Beta. I will be honest and say that I actually prefer Paladins graphics, they are not tough on the eyes or overly flashy and you certainly don't need the latest graphics card to get a good display. ChampionsThere is no way there isn't a playstyle that suits you, as of OB55, there are 29 champions all of which have different attributes and gameplay which make them special. They may lack personality and feel flat sometimes but considering there is so many and Hi-rez is giving it their best shot they are slowly improving; and with some more time and voice packs we'll get there.GameplayIt's certainly smooth enough, but if we take everything into consideration then we obviously have some improvements that can be made.The maps in particular can seem chunky and at times some 'objects/terrain' seem oddly placed.Hitboxes are mostly ridiculous. I'll leave it at thatLag is just as nice as the angry russians that find their way into your game (as with every game)Nerf's and Buffs go in the wrong directions most of the time.But overall it's a'ight.Is it one of the best F2P Moba's out there right now. Yes. and would I play for another 1000 hours. Yes.We're; for the most part a friendly community so I don't see the problem with paladins~It's free and it's worth at least an hour of your time.

At this point I'm pretty sure that the dev doesn't have authenticity to their games. Few things that i dislike the most from this game :Poor optimization. Somehow i get more stable and higher FPS in Overwatch than Paladins.Potato Server.The same with fps, i get stable and better ping in Overwatch compared to Paladins.

I enjoyed Overwatch and it's characters, but it was just missing that ""umph"". Though when I tried out this game, I also had enjoyed the game as well, but here's the difference: I play this game much longer than I ever did for Overwatch. Infact if people say this game is a clone of Overwatch, then I say this game is the original and Overwatch is the clone. Paladins provides a more indepth gameplay than Overwatch, because Overwatch appeals more over to casuals, it's gameplay is just plain simple. Paladins is fluid, provides more tech, skill with it's level system, and cards for much more different playstyles for all SEVENTEEN+ classes. That's alot. The character designs are much more spreaded out from a fennec to dragon, to turtle to Tree monster instead of having mostly a human cast(Overwatch), which make things very interesting and original in my book. I'm actually suprised because the cast in Paladins seems more of the cast Blizzard would dish out.Paladins does not have a backstory as of yet of course because it's in beta, but I'm sure me and many others look forward to one very soon. The characters in this game keeps you guessing becuase they are that mysterious and interesting.  I'm at the point of thinking Overwatch is only big because of it's publisher and not what the game really is. If Blizzard made Paladins, it would get as much recognition as it does now for Overwatch.I honeslty rather have this game TRUMP Overwatch, and look foward to investing more of my time and maybe even my MONEY into this game!",Thu Dec 19 12:22:19 EET 2019,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

Story : 7/10
There was not much story in the game and I did not listen much because it did not have much interesting story except for one episode that I do not want to spoil.
Graphics : 10/10
JUST CAUSE 3 graphics are better than JUST CAUSE 4 and it is very clear when playing game graphics makes me enjoy the game.
Musics : 10/10
The music and sounds of the game were very good, like JUST CAUSE 4, the sounds did not mix, the score was perfect.
Details : 10/10
The details of the explosions and the throwing of the pieces at the time of the explosion were very natural and very good, The physics of driving and crashing was great and natural, just like GTA IV was the physics of cars.
Game play : 7/10
The gameplay was great, it had a lot of weapons, it was good to use them all, only from one part onwards, I did not use tanks or weapons because I only used jetpack, I was flying and shooting 😐.
Variety : 9/10
There was a lot of variety, competitions and areas, capturing cities, etc. The only reason I gave this score is that from one point onwards, the areas were repeated.
Characterization : 10/10
The characters were carefully made. The look of the main character and the look of his friend Mario was very careful. If we look at the difference between Rico and JUST CAUSE 2, we will see a much clearer difference.
Optimization : 9/10
The game was very optimistic, I only dropped the frame during busy times.
Bugs : During this time, I did not see any specific bugs.
Note : The game requires a permanent internet connection, when the internet is disconnected, the game connects and bothers me.
Description : The best version of the game series is JUST CAUSE.

0214e6ed-6d8f-4e17-89f9-3f428794fbc4,3,"Early Access ReviewThis game used to be fun.  Then OB64 happened.With the old 12-point loadout system, everyone was pretty much balanced.  The way it worked was each character had 20 regular cards and 3 legendaries, and you would make a loadout by selecting one legendary and five cards.  Legendary cards would significantly change one of your champion's abilities which would change your playstyle and the role your character could fill.  The other five cards would give further buffs to particular skills.  You could then distribute 12 points among your five cards, with a max of 4 points in any one card, to make that card stronger.  The nice thing about this system is that unlocking new cards didn't strictly make you more powerful, because the cards were pretty balanced.  It just allowed for a wider variety of play styles, which didn't give you a bigger advantage, it only made the game more fun.Now, we have Cards Unbound.  Everyone has every card unlocked at the start, but they're all at level 1.  To level them up, you have to find duplicates in loot boxes.  Gone are the days when everyone would have some strong cards and some weak ones, depending on how they spend their 12 points.  Now, whoever has the most money to spend on lootboxes to level up their cards is going to have the advantage, plain and simple.Just don't waste your time with this game.

Of course, there's so clearly elements from Overwatch, but that's not the focous. Paladins have a new system in a FPS in this style, the decks: each character can be played different depending on the map and the players you are against on. You can be a runner self-healer Viktor or a hip-fire Viktor; you can be a fast flyer Drogoz or a Drogoz focused in direct shots. This system give a whole diversity to the player and to every champion. The cons: The game is full of bugs, you been disconected for no reason, your character bugged on the horse, FPS drop, etc. Of course game is in early access, but I see Hi-Rez dissapointing me and other players because in every patch launch a bunch of cosmectics, VIP system and let the bug fixes away. And other con I see for players who don't want spend money in-game (I'm refering about Founder's pack, who unlocks all current and future champions) is that's very expensive to buy champions and the rotations have only 4 champions.But that's it, I'll give it a 7/10 and pray for Hi-rez not do to Paladins what she do to Smite.",Sun Oct 17 12:02:54 EEST 2021,538539e2-cb36-4192-8f6e-6a2475f523a9

I've put a decent amount of hours into the game and was able to see just how competitive the game can be when played at a higher elo. A lot of people are unhappy with the newest version changing the card system.  I can agree that this change is bad, but not nearly the worst part about this game.  If you like being screamed, having a teamate go afk, or called every name you can think of as soon as a game starts if someoone doesn't like your champion choice or as soon as something goes wrong this is the game for you.  There are a lot of good people in the community, but the amount of toxic players puts games like overwatch (who has gotten a lot of media attention lately about its toxic community) to shame.  This brings me to my next point that this is not an overwatch clone as a lot would point out.  The gameplay is so much different that the two can't even be compared in my opinion.

Considering this is a f2p title, you really don't have anything to lose.The map that I played several times feels familiar in that it has a lane and flanks, a single capture point, and a payload (which I feel  should be extended.)  The matches feel much shorter than Overwatch, and there's no actual mobile skills for our agile characters.  No double-tap dodging, not wall climing, no verticality, none of that.  But there are movement-based skills embedded into most of the heroes.Theres a card sytem which HR calls ""Loadouts.""

I found out quite quickly that what I heard was indeed true. The new card leveling system that had been implemented looks (at least to me) greatly unfair, and very unbalanced. I didn't have to spend uncounted hours to obtain the upgraded cards, as I already had quite a large mass of gold saved from previous time playing the game. But I can understand how difficult it would be to grow your characters, esspecially if you only enjoy playing a small amount of characters. I'd say that the most recent updates to this game was a major step in the wrong direction. There isn't much we can do other than attempt to make Hi-Rez understand this mistake and hopefully allow them to correct themselves. I never really enjoyed this game in the first place, it always seemed a bit out of balance as far as character design. But this update had brought it to another level.

At first untill now, I generally thought they were a fair, kind, and charming company. Friendly developers, frequent interactions with their community and most importantly; their ambition to make Paladins -their main and most popular game- better.Recently, however, Hi-Rez released OB64 (the 64th update in Open Beta). OB64 applied the most changes to the game in one update, and I was pretty hyped for it when I saw the trailer. But when I watched the trailer and looked at the patch notes, I noticed a significant change: The new 'Cards Unbound' system.In the previous cards system, you could use an easy to get, mass produced currency called 'essence'. You could unlock essence by winning games and completing quests, along with using it to level up cards that change a certain champion's statistics and playstyle up to a maximum of 12. This gave players the ability to freely customize their cards, while selecting what cards, builds, and playstyles they were comfortable with. That was what made playing the game balanced, fair and enjoyable.But in the new cards system, the only way you can level up a certain card is to repeatedly open loot chests and hope for the best untill you get a duplicate of that card. Getting a dublicate of a card will level it up, but only to a maximum of 5...Since you have to use the already existing currency of crystals and coins to buy the chests, for example, it will take an estimate of Â£600 to Â£700 just to get a set of cards for frontline champions to level 3!",Tue Dec 21 08:48:54 EET 2021,7538609a-a5e1-47e9-9b84-f27b650d683c

I downloaded this, and honestly have no regrets. Here is why I think so: The characters, inspired by Overwatch in many ways, are fun to play as, and allow players to improve them to their liking in making card loadouts. There is a good balance in character potential, at most times, and every time I play I face new challenges and players that I enjoy battling past.The locked characters and some customizations can be gained by earning gold through playing the game.You can gain credits for a round to get your character minor bonuses that can help your combat depending on your choosing.However...what isn't good about the game is: Sometimes you will feel or be absolutely helpless to certain enemy attacks, such as a well-placed bomb by Skye or you push the cart as an enemy uses a knockpack attack that throws you into a nearby eviromental hazard.

cfeb4fb9-6e67-4d74-922b-d04b94ceab1c,9,"Early Access ReviewI think Hi-Rez has outdone themselves with this game- abilities and shots feel great to use (and don't all require perfect aim), the game is fast-paced with dramatic shifts over the course of any given game being likely, and the overall feel and design of the game is top-notch.The cards strike a decent balance between a traditional MOBA's item shop complexity and clarity- you can only get one card of a given kind and they can all be useful in different situations. You're given in-game currency within a match to get more cards for doing sensible stuff- healing your team, hitting the enemy, and staying on the objective. It's great that they directly incentivize staying on the objective in game.As for the characters, the variation in skills makes playing the different characters change how you play the game pretty drastically, even within a given role. Evie's going to want to get into the middle of the enemy team to freeze them then get out, while Kinessa isn't going to want to be anywhere near the enemy.Overall, I feel like this game strikes a great balance between being friendly to casual players and having complexity in design so you can improve at the game over time.

The story is strong and interesting, although not groundbreaking or anything. Game play is fluid and an absolute blast. Alloy manages to not be a bland protagonist. She has a personality that fits her upbringing, life events, and she keeps the sass on for any circumstance that calls for it. She reacted to things in a very down to earth manor, and in a similar way to how I imagine someone would actually act in her position. Side characters are decent, but the Frozen Wilds DLC is where NPCs really got to shine. Its story is stellar and an excellent addition to the game.

On a technical level the game is very well done. Its stunning visuals and solid performance make the PC version the definitive experience. I did encounter a few crashes, but they were rare. Also, twice I had the world turn purple and blotchy, though this was likely due to my GPU overclock. 

Facial animation was very week to start off with. Characters looked plastic like and had terrible mismatched facial animations. However, as the plot went on, things improved. The DLC then turned things on its head and had stellar facial expressions, animations, and styling.",Sat Dec 04 20:17:49 EET 2021,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

HiRez created many perks in the game with the updates every week or the next, it can be kinda hard to catch up sometimes. I'm almost perfectly positive with the review but what concerns me is the lack of champion balance. Instead of releasing new champions every two weeks or so, how about focusing on setting right tunes for the abilities? And please do stop the habit of making new heroes OP, or making legendary cards that make champions almost impossible to kill, or have ridiculous damage.

To this day I still log in several hours every week, and my fiancee and I choose to play this as our game-of-choice, but it's partially because I can't talk her out of it and partially because I still love some of my main champions, even though Hi-Rez (a more accurate name would be Low-Rez) has ruined some of the best aspects of them.Ultimately, I cannot recommend anyone start in on this game, primarily for the reasons you typically see in amateur developers. Far too focused on skins and money-making. Haven't fixed bugs that people have been complaining about for a long time, and with every update, extending that bug list to the point where I dread every update. On top of that, majority of the champions they add are so OP that the community rages and threatens to abandon the game (see OB64). Low-Rez has undone and then undone their mistakes and the undone themselves yet again so many times, I really do look forward to leaving this game in the dust. The hitboxes are way too large and lag behind mobility abilities (and no, I'm not talking about network lag. I mean legitimately, direct damage champions shooting you around the corner half a second after you've netherstepped, shell spinned, advanced, etc around said corner). You've got champion legendaries that create virtually impossible-to-interrupt ability combos that guarantee a kill. Remember how fun 007: Golden Eye was, everyone walking around with the golden gun? Imagine every game, half the people have the golden gun and the others have regular guns. No, this is not me being salty about being outplayed. I tend to either lead in damage/heals or carry teams more often than not. I love good games, regardless of whether I win or not. But anything that boosts your damage by 35% is just ridiculous. making 3 flank champions impossible to keep up with while slowing down the rest is unacceptable. They've ruined some of my favorite parts of certain champions, parts that made them UNIQUE. Now everyone just feels like playing a basic damage, and you're reading a review from someone who actually enjoys playing Viktor (the normal Viktor, not this ugly♥♥♥♥♥pretty-boy viktor).Anyways, I'm hoping I gave enough reasons to let you know why you should find a different FPS TDM game.

55e50825-58a4-44f4-aeda-aef762c20738,4,"Early Access ReviewSo, uh, this game has been through a bunch. So many changes, both good and bad (we don't speak of OB64...), and it's made a really good F2P game that I wish I could run better.Let's start from my first experience on this game. I've been playing since Early Alpha, before its Steam release, and it was on its own client from a browser. I played Old Siege, which is FAN. TASTIC. and I want it back so desperately. I got a free code from somewhere on YouTube, can't remember where, but I immediately understood everything about the game when I started. I remember Buck being a Front Line before, and Cassie's default voice-pack was the same as Night Bane's.Besides all of my fond memories of Early Alpha, I've witnessed so much change in this game, but I still wish there were more, like a better way to get VIP points faster, and easier crystals besides quests and daily rewards. I also wish Hi-Rez would add a bunch more skins, such as a Legendary skin for every champion in some sort of ""skin update"", consisting of only skins, and of course, balance changes. They're pumpin' out new content, but we gotta focus on more detailed things, and already-existing content: the skins.So we need a better grind, more skins, and gamemodes. Also, can we try and roam around the maps in some offline mode, like being able to load a map and roam around it solo.Otherwise, I give this a solid 9/10, just lookin' for not more content, but additions to existing content. Great game, just take more time.",Sun Jan 17 12:04:06 EET 2021,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1
ea6eaf59-5adc-4b44-81e5-2551b85cb404,0,"Early Access ReviewI started playing this game around August 2016, in OB34. I instantly fell in love with the game mechanics and how it played. Being able to tweak and customize your loadouts, along with choosing the right items to go with it, was a big part of what made the game amazing to me. Too bad Hi-Rez started adding some very bland characters that add absolutely no value to the game, so now we have like 4 humanlike champions that shoot weapons with a fast rate of fire. The balancing has been questionable to say the least, with devs constantly changing the core mechanics of characters we've been practicing for hundreds of hours, like projectile speed, mobility and even the ♥♥♥♥ing recoil and rate of fire of weapons, making sure all those hours we've put in order to be a specialist in a certain champion went down the drain and we have to learn everything again.On top of that, we had FOUR types of currency up until yesterday. When the third currency was about to be implemented ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE COMPLAINED. The devs went with it, the community kept complaining, and later on they balanced the amount of grind required in order to get that currency. Few months later and we have the fourth currency, yet another way of milking money from the players. Now guess what? F*ck the third currency. Yeah, f*ck that, that's it. We're exchanging that for gold (the first currency) instead. Nevermind that gold is like 3x easier to get, we're converting them 1-1 to your account.Oh, and about that cool Loadout customization system based on cards, the thing that sets Paladins apart from it's competitors? How about we nuke the sh*t out of that system? The thing absolutely nobody ever complained about. Now instead of having a 12 point system that you could distribute, everyone is set on the same amount of points, with all cards being weaker on the competitive game mode. That means all the heavily cooldown-oriented builds don't work anymore, because what would reset 100% of your CD on a certain action now only resets 40%, and you can't change it at all. You think that's bad? Well, the most popular gamemode, casuals, has actually increased the strength of the cards, some of them to ridiculously OP levels. The biggest problem? You have to grind for LITERALLY years of gameplay in order to get all the cards to the maximum level, and it's totally RNG based. Money also helps OF COURSE, because that's what the devs want. But you STILL have to grind like crazy, that means some people will have these overpowered cards with like 60% bigger blast radius on their main attacks, playing against someone that has 20%. Fair and balanced, right?Sorry, but that's too much for me, the game was fun while it lasted, but a thousand hours later I realize the devs don't really give a f*ck about what the community thinks, they don't even know where they're headed with the game. I lost my confidence in Hi-Rez, won't ever spend money on this game again. Uninstalled.",Fri Nov 13 21:23:26 EET 2020,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

Paladins is a 5v5 team-based first person shooter, which at the time of this review, is in closed beta. The game comes across as an Overwatch clone, but it is extremely fun nevertheless.Pros:-Solid combat and controls, movement and gameplay feels smooth-Well optimized. Runs smoothly on 3 PC's I tested it on-The card-based loadout system for each champion is a nice feature. Allows for you to customize your champions abilities and create various loadouts for different scenarios-Matches are a reasonable length, and learning how to overcome and capture each objective within each match challenges the player-The game itself is free, but you can purchase the Founder's Pack, which includes all current and future champions in the game, as well some exclusive skins-Matchmaking is reasonably balanced. I found matches within seconds while playing on the EU serversCons:-Considering that it is in beta, the game has crashed unexpectedly on me a few times. Sometimes after a match has been completed, I will get a black screen in which I have to force end the game and restart it.-Logging in has also  proven to be a bit difficult, as I would have to try logging in 3-4 times before I get into the gameThis is a solid F2P title, especially if you are too poor for Overwatch. Give it a go, I have had a lot of fun playing this game so far and the game should get even better once it is out of beta.8/10",Tue Sep 15 16:55:01 EEST 2020,9d0be856-dfdd-41f5-92fe-d6cddd384051

It's an extremely polished game already.Some people complain about balancing issues but from personal experience it's actually very well balanced. Each game is different as you, your teammates and opponents use different champions. If you're feeling like the game is imbalanced, you're probably just matched up poorly with your opponents and maybe using the wrong strategy. Perhaps being able to change champions mid match, maybe between rounds, could help remedy this a little.As far as the micro-transactions go; this is the way I like to see them done. You CAN pay real money to unlock all the champions, but you absolutely do NOT have to. The micro-transactions don't give any one player an advantage over the other unless you consider a different colour skin to be an advantage.It's a really enjoyable PVP Hero shooter which, while it is similar in a few aspects, isn't an Overwatch clone.

Probably heavily inspired from it, and that's no shame.Ladders, arena, pack opening, classes very similar to the 9 classes.

You'll need a decent graphics card though, one that can at least maintain 30 fps even in some of the more intense parts that have a lot going on as that is the main problem I faced with a laptop 1060 (did not have the DLSS update at the time). It can get a little frustrating when you cannot clear one of the corrupted zones because the frame rate drops exactly when you are in the middle of an intense fight.
I would recommend taking advantage of the up-scaling features in the recent update if your PC supports it!

28203b21-2b37-4003-9045-786b900e3e16,2,"I have very mixed things to say about the game itself.Mechnically, it's great. You can use the same profile on your phone, tablet, computer, etc; essentially play anywhere given you have the free time to do so. The animations are smooth even on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bring-to-work tablet, and I rarely experience lag. One of the downsides is that in the middle of pvp games, the memory usage spikes, and you get thrown out of the game unexpedectly. Which equals a win for them and no stat gain for you. If you're looking to play ranked with non-aggro, you're going to have a bad time. Heavencraft is stupidly broken. The other crafts have their own issues, but I'm genuinely expecting a nerf to heaven soon. A legendary that lets you win the game? Reminds me of Yu-Gi-Oh before they banned and limited drawing cards. Maybe it's just the salty me who's getting too into ranked. It's a fun game, don't get me wrong. The cards are beautiful, the quests are fun, and you get a good amount of things from login bonuses, quests, and achievements. It makes it enjoyable and not so much of a grind. But there IS a huge grind whenever you're the one who pays attention to the meta and have to get a certain card. You simply don't get enough items to make the cards.Why you should play it? If you like hearthstone but with prettier cards, better quests, and hours of first-download content.Why shouldn't you play it? Insta-win decks, broken crafts, and the long grind for that one necessary card. And then cards that are necessary that you can't grind and are only available through luck of the draw.",Fri Dec 03 05:53:39 EET 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

28203b21-2b37-4003-9045-786b900e3e16,5,"Basically, it's Hearthstone, but with anime waifus. And who doesn't love anime waifus?In all seriousness though, Shadowverse, for all intents and purposes, is a Hearthstone clone. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matter of the fact is that Hearthstone as it is now is incredibly unbalanced, and none of the new expansions seem to be coming close to fixing the issues the game has. Shadowverse meanwile, has a fresh start, and new mechanics to freshen up the game you're used to. You see, in this game, there's a mechanic which is called ""evolving,"" and it allows you to turn your cards into more powerful versions of themselves about 2-3 times per game. Evolves bring a new level of strategy into the tried and true card battle formula, allowing for plays that could potentially change the tide of the game.If you've played Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, or Yu-Gi-Oh before, and you want something new and exciting, at least give this game a try. It's not like other card games where you'll be paying hundreds of dollars just to make one good deck- they give you lots of free card packs when you start, and the ability to earn more in-game currency to buy more isn't that difficult.

That's enough to build several competitive decks in but days from starting. Other cool features about this game are private matches, and PRIVATE ARENA. You can literally play the game with friends without collecting a single card. It has spectator mode, it has achievements, daily login reward, daily quests, monthly rewards. There's always something to do and you CANNOT go wrong with this game.

e8b000a7-ec35-4f90-895c-90f8980228b2,3,"This game has done nothing but impress me since I started playing. I first heard about it months ago when Kripparian sponsored it on his channel, but wasn't too interested at the time. Few weeks ago I started playing it on my phone after the staleness that Hearthstone has become was too much to take. Now that it's on Steam, it's even better then ever.First of all, from a beginner's standpoint this game gives you the MOST stuff for free I've ever seen in a card game. 30 packs right after finishing the tutorial gives you such a headstart (There's also a way to reroll your packs on mobile version until you get the best choices). Most decks are also very cheap or easy to make, minus the heavy control-oriented decks, so it's simple to hop right in with a competitive deck for ladder.As for balance, almost all of the classes are viable in a competitive format. Personally, I feel Shadowcraft is a bit weaker than the rest in the current meta. Each class has their own unique mechanics that affect how you build your decks. Great thing is that each class has a diverse range of options for both the aggro and control players. Unlike Hearthstone, Combo decks are also highly encouraged in higher rankings, and they are a blast to play.Visual-wise this game has the obvious ""anime"" and ""waifu"" feel. However, everything in game from the animations to the card art is very detailed and gorgeous. Can tell they put a lot of work into making each card art look unique and interesting. Voice-work is ok in some areas. English voice-overs can sound cheesy and forced sometimes. Japanese voice-overs just sound like typical anime, but fits better with the game overall.All-in-all this game is simply amazing. If people can look past the japanese influences and style, this game has the potential to even beat out Blizzard's monster that is Hearthstone.",Tue Aug 25 04:19:05 EEST 2020,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

e8b000a7-ec35-4f90-895c-90f8980228b2,0,"Great game.  Similar to hearthstone but without a lot of the problems that hearthstone has.  Tons of rewards for new players to help them get right into the game.  After the tutorial they give you 40+ free packs and then from beating the ai with the characters you get free take two tickets (draft mode) and unlock some great cards that you'll be using in your decks for a very long time (some are standard in high ranked meta decks).  Their individual stories are interesting and not too long.  They give you a daily reward just for logging in and 3 quests.  If you want to be a free player it's far easier to do so vs other ccgs.The evolve mechanic is great.  Starting on turn 4 The player that went second can evolve a minion which gives it a buff (and on specific cards triggers an ability) and allows it to attack on the turn it's played.  The player that went first gets two uses of this ability, the player that went second gets three.  It really helps balance out the initial advantage of going first and leads to very interesting gameplay/stratagies.The draft mode (take two) has you choose two cards for your deck at a time between two pairs of cards.  This leads to some very interesting decisions.  Do you take the two cards that are both just ok quality or do you take the pair that has one good card and one not so great card.If you do want to spend some money they have several pre-built decks for you to buy that have strong legendaries in them and are worth the $.  If you just want packs they have a daily deal where you can buy a pack a day at half the normal price.I love the card art in this game, it's very well done.  The animations are great as well.The makers of this game really seem to care about their players time.  I've gotten many free packs from when they were a couple of hours late on an update... and I wasn't even around trying to play the game at the time.

e75795b1-18c2-4143-9f7b-28a88552f8fe,6,"tl;drHearthstone with cute anime girls. 10/10--------------------------------------So what I really like about this game compared to hearthstone, is that in hearthstone I had trouble building a deck that made sense, in this game, it is a lot easier, I cannot tell exactly why. but there are enough obvious synergy in this game that building a deck is easy and fun. something that is also really great for new players, is that you get atleast about 30-40 card packs from both card sets (basic and the 1st expansion) so about 20 packs from each set. the first thing I did was playing the campaign to learn the cards and class abilities, and after doing 1½ campaign (each class has their own campaign) I checked out all the kinds of rewards I had gotten after a couple of hours of play against AI, and noticed I had 50+ packs. Which was really great, opening them all up. and then sitting an hour figuring out what sort of decks you can make with all them cards. if you are not totally unlucky, you should definetly get a few legendaries, and a lot of rare cards, just after a couple of hours of play.the artstyle is all over the place, you can definetly see there are multiple artists using their own style when they drew the art of the cards. but overall it looks great. specially if you are a fan of anime, but you will find some pretty fantastic art regardless of your view of japanese art style. Differences Between Hearthstone and Shadowverse:Evolution, Cards can be evolved giving them either +2/+2 or in general +1/+1 and an effect. The artstyle of the card will usually change, if it is a girl, it usually is removal of some clothes. but in general the card will look like it really evolved, sometimes changing the art on the card completely. most of them are just reskins. but some cards will look completely different. Class abilities. class abilities in hearthstone was something you used for mana, in this game, you usually have a passive ability, that completely change the way you should play that class. some classes doesn't really have a passive more so that what makes that class unique is their cards. Which comes to the next difference, very few neutral cards.in this game you will be using mostly your class cards, the neutral cards are mostly their for beginners, when you haven't unlocked all the class cards yet. Exception being the rare and legendary neutral cards, they are often very strong, so if you have one, make sure you use them if your deck fit!",Sun Nov 21 22:15:41 EET 2021,dd444eaa-df1c-477f-9f34-ffa156f5bc2c
e75795b1-18c2-4143-9f7b-28a88552f8fe,5,"Pros- If you like the artwork/ anime-style then Shadowverse is great for you. My main reason why I like this game is the great artwork as well as the animated artwork. If you don't like it then Shadowverse isn't the game for you.- A lot of free packs to start off and randomly get packs from time to time. Very generous.- Fast paced draft mode compared to many other games. Can finish a run within 30-45 minutes. This allows for easier farming if you are good at this mode.- Expansions every 3 months which allows for more toys to play with.Cons- Shadowverse is not very high in decision making. Most decks are play on curve, although there are a few decks that play differently (PtP decks, D Shift). These types of decks are my favorite.- A lot of disparity between match-up and win rates. For example playing D Shift you have a 90% or higher win rate versus control decks, and have a lower than 50% win-rate versus aggressive decks. Losing a game because you queued into a poor match-up with a 10% win-rate is not a good feeling.- Going 1st and 2nd is huge in different match-ups is also huge. For example I feel that if I start first with D shift I have a much better win-rate versus all decks. No specific percentage but I'd say on average a 10% higher win-rate. This is out of your control so it feels quite awful. Other decks prefer to go 2nd and they might experience similar win-rate differences.- Draft mode balance is horrendous and exacerbates the starting 1st or 2nd difference. I'd estimate at least a 10% (maybe up to 20%) higher win rate difference if you go 2nd in the draft mode. This makes playing the draft mode a poor experience.Conclusion- Other than the balance issues and the relative lack of decision making in this game, Shadowverse is great for anime fans who like a rather casual digital card game. Do not expect a super hard game that requires an abundance of decision making.",Sun Dec 05 05:19:41 EET 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

86c5a2a0-350e-4bc4-a1f2-ce2e4f2b1a1e,1,"I started playing Shadowverse like 2 weeks ago, because I got bored with HS aggro meta. From the very first moment, I just couldn't stop playing. The game provided me with tons of free packs and content. After 100 hours in the game, I spent 50$, bought some prebuilt decks and perfected my Sword and Forest collection. It took me approximately 10 days to get from Beginner 0 to AA0. I honestly had a lot of fun.However, at rank AA0, I learned the other, frustrating side of SV. I am currently facing Dragon Ramp and Aggro Shadow in 70% of games. In 20% I face Albertcraft and Aegis Haven. The remaining 10% consists of Blood Aggro, Roach Forest and D-Shift Rune. The missing balance in deck usage and performance slowly kills the fun I have with the game.Dragon can ramp up without taking any risks, because he heals himself, draws cards, clears the board and generates threats at the same time while ramping. Then he easily stomps/outvalues opponents with big legends, storm followers and unmatched AOE removal.Shadow swarms the board and gets boosted when you actually clear their board. If you manage to somehow completely remove his followers while barely staying alive, there's still Phantom Howl and Cerberus combo which makes for a nice 9 or more dmg out of hand. There are endless possibilities for balancing, for example making Reapers pay for Ambush with shadows, forcing other abilities from evolves (Orthrus comes to mind) and so on.From what I read I found out that Cygames intentionally boosted these classes, because they were bad before. Okay, I take it, this is also a way of rotating the meta. But God, there is a difference between making a class viable and making it unmatched... Since Dragon pretty much destroys every conrol and Shadow outplays every aggro, there is very limited selection of viable decks for current meta. Both leading decks are also very different, which makes teching against one break the deck consistency.The worst thing is that the situation in unranked play is completely same, so you cannot just take it casually and expect to avoid FOTM decks in unranked games.Despite all that I said, I recommend the game. The quantity of free content is undeniable and the game is very entertaining when you don't take it too seriously. As for me, I will probably just farm rupies and wait for a better meta situation. After all, Un'Goro made HS enjoyable again, so I can as well return for some time.",Sun Sep 26 14:13:36 EEST 2021,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

I was rather skeptical of this game when most of my friends started playing it, having never played a card game like this before, you can probably understand why, but I'm glad I picked it up. This game was kind of hard to pick up and understand at first (again, having never played a T/CCG before) and even after trying to learn it I'm not that good and play one class almost exclusively but I still like it.Before you start asking if it's pay to win, it's not, you get so many free card packs and in game currency just for playing and the only thing in game you have to spend crystals  (paid for currency) on are the prebuilt card packs which you can just write down the cards from their info screen and make them yourself. While a lot of the current meta decks are based on using legandary cards for the current newest expansion, rise of bahamut, you don't need them as a lot of other cards will work well. (Mordecai will always be the best card) While there are moments where you might be cheated out of a victory becuase your win condition card is on the bottom of your deck there are cards that force a draw of a high-cost card and you can use mulitples of that card in your deck.Ragequiting is also apperently a thing that happens a lot when people know or think they can't win, to the point where people I have fought would sit there and wait to see if I quit. So the only thing I have to say about that is: even if you think you're saving us both time, it doesn't make it any less cowardly.So yeah, this game is fun, even to just collect the cards, so if you've been thinking of playing a CCG or have played a lot of them I would recommend this for you. The only other bad thing I'd say about this game is that the english translation was rather poorly done.Wow, this was a rather long and serious review, this is weird, uh, uh, go mordecai!

I guess it's worth the experience given from the salty players here (as you can see in the reviews section), the facebook community, and the neverending memes from many Japanese youtubers and international players alike. Competitive and all nerfs have excellent reasoning. But, as for the newest expansion release.. I have doubt in cygames testers, per se.Enjoy your stay, may luck bestows upon you in your journey towrards the Nexus! Don't even try to grind being those filthy tryhards in game just to reach the highest rank possible.. Just enjoy the game to the fullest, as many Japanese card games teach us to!-------What I like from this game is the variety of races and species introduced by Japanese style. From cute girls / seductive older women, handsome boys / manly older men, holy and unholy beings, dragons, devils, zombies, and much more! Not to mention those cool animations and voice-acting (in Japanese) when you play the cards on the field and when you play the story. I never got bored with it, always yearning for more in the next expansion. Almost a year had passed, I don't mind playing it again for 2-3 years in the future. I prefer this game rather than spending cash on real trading card games (or the other premium CCG of this kind by the well-known developer, because it's not my preference)This game really gives me the laughs over the difficult time of my lfie, even though sometimes this game is the one who made me stressed out and bringing so much hatred. It's just like aneverending love and hate relationship~",Tue Jan 04 10:18:39 EET 2022,e1fbf2f9-6cd1-442c-a4b7-4fbcd39146dd

I can't seems to find the quit button since it is under more tab on buttom far right.-My complain is the 3d world doesnt add new game mechanics to the gameplay besides visual purpose. Will be nice to be able to rotate your monster around different axis in the 3d space to provide your chance of dodging enemy attack. -Once you get lots of follower cards on the field and enemy have no monster u basically dominate the field.

93ba5de4-2f51-49f8-b0ea-e048eebb33f5,9,"My 5th Free to play card game (Epic Card battle>HS>Duelyst>Faeria>Shadowverse)First things first is this P2W? Slightly but due to devs giving you 40+ Booster packs at start it cancels it out since you have infinite chances to reroll what you get, you can start with a deck you are satisfied with. This would mean you dont start with just basic cards at the start and you can actually get meta decks with the original cards you get. If you want other stronger decks you will have to Grind it out or be lucky. Legendary drop rates are a bit low which is why I still think its ""Slightly P2W"" for other decks you dont have good cards with.Case in point. My Haven deck was nearly complete and was technically only missing on 2 Legendaries that I can somewhat replace with Gold cards. Not as efficient as the actual tier deck but I'll take it as a F2P deck.The game is like Hearthstone but the added ""mechanic"" of Evolution is nice but the thing that made me like this more is the fact that RNG is minimal there has only been 1 time where i really lost a game due to RNG due to a card. Missions are a bit abundant with 3 every 21 hours. Playing everyday should give you 1 booster pack in Gold. Not as much as Duelyst which makes",Thu Nov 04 23:44:44 EET 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

It will have 8 expansions per year instead of the current 4.The mini set consists nothing but Legendary and Gold cards.The legendary cards are extremly powerful.They can do 1 for 2 trade, or kill you in 1 turn.It is common to dust 100 packs for a deck.

fa091433-700d-4d03-af87-f67be0e6829c,9,"-----Pros------Fairly high quality anime art.All of the cards are well drawn, and the company actually makes TWO sets of art for each card, one for its evolved form and one for its normal form! That's pretty outrageous, considering that you will only be evolving around 3 cards in a game, and once you get into it you'll find that you tend to evolve only a few different cards in each deck archetype. Whether this is a great feature or just a lot of extra work for the artists is a question you'll have to answer for yourself. Also, plenty of male catering; lots of large breasts, exposed skin, and anime armor.-Voice acting.If you play the story you will find all of the characters are fully voiced during the narrative. Not much to say on that one.-Moderate game balance (insofar).From what I could see, your starting experience with the game will be heavily influenced by the contents of your starting packs. They give you 10 of each pack in the current expansion rotation, and it can be fairly overwhelming to look through all of those cards as a new player. It also seems to me that creating new accounts to re-open the legendary pack you start with just to get the legendary card you want is a problem. But low-level matchmaking has yeilded fairly even games overall.-----Cons------""Unstable Connection"" error severely distrups gameplay.In any competetive game a connection error is disruptive. But this error occurs even when your connection is perfectly stable. I've experienced it frequently enough that I started running a connection tracker while playing the game; there was no interruption to pings to the server even when I got this error. The bug causes you to forfeit the match, which is tolerable in casual and barely so in ranked play, but when you're playing in the arena and only get a grand total of 5 games it is unacceptable.-Draftbreaking Cards.I am particularly fond of draft-based formats, because they guarantee variety and they avoid having a rigid metagame. In Shadowverse however there are several cards that you can get in draft that will single-handedly win you the game. These are cards that are clearly designed to be fair in constructed play, where they would tend to be a bit too slow to see play in every deck of that class, but which absolutely dominate in draft. So, unfortunately, this format is not successful.-Complicated.Cards have a huuuuuge amount of text. It's waaaay more than Hearthstone and even substatially more than Magic the Gathering. Probably close to YuGiOh; maybe a little more even than that. Prepare to read a lot. And boy, if a wordy card appears on the opponent's side that you've never seen before you better just guess!----Relative Cons-----Pay-to-Win (kinda).If you are interested in being at the top of the ranked ladder you're going to need to invest serious time or money. I cannot say how this compares to, say, Hearthstone, since I haven't reached that level of play yet myself, but my research on the current meta shows a very high density of rare cards.-Ugly Interface.The menu interface is ugly. I mean, seriously. All of it. Deckbuilding, main menus, settings, battlefield, etc. There's little creativity or appeal in it.-Japanese-Majority.Nothing wrong with it inherently! But it does mean that if you make friends in the game they are less likely to be english-speakers. And of course this is actually a Pro if you speak japanese yourself! I imagine the Japanese version is probably better, too.----Summary----Unless you particularly like the art style, or particularly dislike something about Hearthstone, I wouldn't recommend trying this game.",Wed Aug 11 23:32:16 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef

The game is fun to watch for sure, I dont think I'll ever get tired of all the animations and quirky voicelines involved.Cons:Holy hell where do I begin?  This game is in drastic need of the ""Phase"" system used in every popular and successful TCG.  Without it it's impossible to properly balance and some decks will always be superior to others because of that.  There is such a crushing disadvantage associated with going first in this game, to the extent that I've surrendered games within the first few turns.  You not only have 1 less critical evolution when going first, but you also have to wait 1 extra turn before you can evolve. As a result it's overwhelmingly easier to shift momentum in 2nd than it is to hold onto it in 1st.  Other TCGs have adiquite balance (like card advantage) to counterbalance first turn momentum, this game strives to remove first turn momentum completely and as such removes any sort of potential advantage the first turn has.Final Verdict:I'm gonna stick to MTG and Force of Will...",Sat Jan 01 03:03:03 EET 2022,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

13a1999d-2bc0-4398-9626-cc03ce28be84,2,"At face value this game seems like a clone of Hearthstone. If you tried Hearthstone you'll feel right at home with how the game works at it's core but with some distinct differences for the better.- RNG element in cards is much more limited. In the cards i got from the starter packs i encountered maybe a single card that pulls something random from the deck.  Not a madhouse of RNG like Hearthstone is.- It's systems although not overly complex, Hearthstone isn't complex either though. The evolve mechanic is really unique and feels quite ""anime-like"" in my opinion. You can choose to get a more powerful version of any card 2 or 3 times on each match.Also when cards evolve have another VO and a new art. Which is very nice indeed. - It is more ""pretty"" than Hearthstone. Artwork is top-notch for what it is, anime-styled artwork. There are more emotes to choose from to communicate through your hero, the cards are just so nice to look at.- Foil cards are just very, very nice looking. I sincerely never bothered with foil cards. In HS i just converted them to spirit. In Shadowverse they just look, very nice. - The game is very generous with it's rewards and the starter cards it gives you. I think it's like 40 packs plus boosters cost like 1 dollar each, getting Rupies doesn't seemed too hard either. I would say it's even more generous than Duelyst. And i believe Duelyst is quite generous.And now some bad things:-----------------------------------From what i read, this is a port from an android app. It feels and looks like it quite a few times sadly and the interface is generally clunky and unusual compared to your standard PC game. Also there's game menus that prompt you to ""Tap"" here and there. Hopefully the UI will get ironed out if there's success for the PC platform.You can't mix and max faction cards together. That's a pet peeve of mine, because i believe it really limits you to just try and create with a much more limited card number and strategy available.As a sidenote if you enjoy japanese VOs more you can do it, there's a post in the Steam forum explaining how.All in all it's a pretty, enjoyable game with simpler yet enjoyable mechanics, affordable for the free to play player and easy to learn, especially if you tried Hearthstone before.",Sat Jun 26 17:26:07 EEST 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

But, one day, I was bored and try to find a new free-to-play game and decided to install this Hearthstone for weebs.It was the best decision ever!At the beginning, Shadowverse give you a tutorial; you know, like how to play the game. After finished the tutorial, they'll give you a LOT of freebies like Rupies (gold), Crystals, and even pack (booster) tickets; if I remember correctly, it was 20 pack tickets for two expansion (Standard & Darkness Evolved). You can spend Rupies to buy an extra pack (1oo Rupies for a pack) or buy new Leaders (in-game character; cosmetic only).GameplayShadowverse is a fast-paced card game, kinda like Yu-GI-Oh! in XYZ/Synchro/Pendulum era. You can choose one from seven playstyle (each playstyle have different Leader) that have its own power and weakness. With combination and strategy of cards (Follower, Spell, Amulet) in deck, you must deplete enemy Leader's shield (20 point). There's also a evolution mechanism that evolve your Follower to have more Atk/Def point or even new effect.There are Solo and Multi mode. In Solo mode, you can experience some in-game story/lore for each Leader or do Pratice versus any Leader of you choice. In Multi mode, you can choose unranked match, ranked match, or private match with your friend. There is also an Arena mode in which you play Take Two by building a 30-cards deck by choosing one of two pairs choice; there are total five match in Take Two and you'll get better rewards for every win.In the latest update, you can now buy a pre-built deck which is good for starter. Each pre-built deck can be bought for 500 crystals for the first time and 750 crystals for the second and third time (you can only buy each pre-built deck three times).Oh, don't forget that you can sync the game data with the mobile version (Android/iOS) so you can play on the go.VisualIt's gorgeous! The artwork of every card is beautiful and cool. There's even some animated card which make it more gorgeous than a standard card. If you like some ""fan-service""artwork, you'll find it here too.AudioMost of the card have its own voice; the English voice is pretty good in my opinion (my favorite is the voice of ""Aurelia, Regal Saber"" and ""Oathless Knight""). If you prefer, you can switch to Japanese voice by choosing Japanese language in Steam' Properties settings.In-app PurchaseLike other free-to-play games, there is an in-app purchase options for you. You can spend real money to buy Crystals that can be used to buy pack, pre-built deck, and Leader.

8ef8add0-a30e-47b1-95d8-d3bbc56460f8,1,"When playing ranked matches as a beginner in Beginner rank, nearly every opponent (like 4/5) played against has a netdeck full of legendary and gold cards. A new player normally would not be able to get these rare, expensive cards, but some players will continually reroll (starting the entire game over) to make use of the starting 10 packs per expansion. Players get to keep trying to get lots of legendary cards. Once they do, they liquefy all those cards besides the ones they need for the netdeck, obtaining vials. These vials are then used to purchase the exact cards from the chosen netdeck. In this way, many new players instantly have competitive decks, but can only use that one deck. All other players who did not do this are then forced to fight against competitive decks in beginner rank, making them lose over and over again.In summary, beginners either have to get themselves stuck with one deck or use the basic cards and be overwhelmed by netdecks right from the start.",Sat Sep 11 14:29:36 EEST 2021,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f

ea420e46-b4fc-44eb-afeb-59f621e4e4b3,6,"Firstly, i was kind of skeptical regarding this game because I did not like the ”anime„ theme and the way the game was developed, also I did consider the graphics poorly designed. However, the most important element of a game are not the graphics nor the development of it but the actual gameplay value and the overall enjoyment, things that this game succeeds drastically. Shadowverse is a card-board game thing... with different classes and different cards of different rarities. As a card-board game there are 4 major things that influence your win rate. The RNG ( random number generator), your deck quality and the  match-making system and your strategy. I was amazed to find out that this game, who looks poorly desiged managed to control the RNG factor so smoothly. SHAME ON YOU HEARTHSTONE (piratestone, heroes of patches). Match-making system works smoothly as well, there are a lot of strategies and playstyles.Now, talking about the deck quality... You see it is kinda hard for a new player to get the expensive cards or to understand how to spend their resources on improving his deck. For a new player, this game is INCREDIBLY friendly. I have opened like 30-40 packs in one hour of gameplay, and i had enough resources to build a competitive deck ( btw, u can import decks via codes which is a life saver )LET-S TALK ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD NOT PLAY THIS(cons)1) it looks cheap / poorly designed2) it is too weeaboo, too much anime3) voice acting looks badLETS TALK ABOUT WHY U SHOULD PLAY THIS (pros)1) it is catchy2) it is friendly3) it has cool mechanics4) it will not make you wanna punch your monitor 5) you will not be grinding too much gold for s**tty cards (if you have played hearthsone: grinding 3 wings of an adventure with useless cards just to get to the last one with all the meta-used cards)Overall, i would rate this game with 8/10 just because i hate it„s oppai-anime theme and graphics.

Shadowverse caught my eye and I decided to give it a try...I really really want to like this game but it just isn't good. So apparently right when you start this game, it's heavily advised that you ""reroll"" your account to get a good start. So for the first two days of playing this game I wasn't actually playing, I was just constantly playing the tutorial --> buying all the free packs --> opening said packs for good legendaries --> reseting the app data and trying again. Today I was finally able to break the cycle and actually play the game and oh boy was it not fun at all. The starter cards they give you are so insanely bad that even clearing the single player content becomes a grind of replaying missions until you draw the right cards and your opponent doesn't. After messing around in single player for a bit I decided to see what online was like and it wasn't any better.

Has one of the best rates to pull Legendary cards from packs compared to other games.  Free packs are also bountiful and easy to obtain (58 for just starting the game as of this review).  Even better, the overall cards are very well balanced with each deck archetype having their own pros and cons.

I have played Hearthstone, Duelyst, Eternal, Elder Scrolls Legends, Gwent, and Shadowverse.I feel like Shadowverse takes a lot of inspiration from Hearthstone, without making too many of the same mistakes.  Hopefully anime girls don't bother you because you'll be seeing plenty of them.The main mechanic that makes Shadowverse stand out from Hearthstone is 'Evolve.'  This gives a follower +2/+2 and allows them to attack an opposing follower immediately.  Some cards even have effects that activate when they are evolved.  In addition to drawing an extra card, the second turn player will also get one more opportunity to evolve.  First player gets to evolve twice, second player can evolve three times.Right now the meta game is fairly balanced.  It seems like all the classes have viable decks.  If you care about being super competitive the best class for aggro is bloodcraft.  That would be the best/cheapest deck to try and rank up if that's all you care about.",Fri Aug 27 14:39:40 EEST 2021,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

6af4371b-ce10-4156-80db-2424fc66b83b,4,"A lot of cute girls, funny or annoying guys, ugly, awesome, and/or sickening monsters, and a lot of crazy moments that make you feel like a total boss or like a pathetic slave. It's a rollercoaster of a game, and the experience seems to change drastically with every new card set that comes out.One of the most interesting things they do is they use the same 'hero power' for every class, and instead give each class their own trait. Personally, I have some misgivings about some of the design decisions they've made for the various classes, but it's undeniable that each class feels very different from the others.Draw RNG is a big deal in this game, the decks have to be small, not quite as small as in Hearthstone, but considering that you can include up to 3 copies of each card that you want in your deck, it can arguably feel like your decks are even smaller than a Hearthstone deck when it comes to the decision of which cards to use when making a deck.Fortunately, it's not incredibly difficult to get some wins in this game, you can find yourself and others failing hard due to being flabbergasted by unfamiliar cards. Many cards perform much differently than how you would expect them to, which leaves a lot of room for exploration of the mechanics of the game as well as the flow of power. They are introducing new stuff pretty much all the time, similarly to how Wizards of the Coast does things, and surprisingly they love to make crazy cards that challenge the way you think about the game. Unfortunately, much like for Hearthstone, it can be difficult at times to acquire the cards you need to be competitive.I actually feel satisfied with the comeback mechanic of first player vs second player compared to Hearthstone for example...the player going second gets to hero power one turn earlier than the player going first, and on top of that gets to do it one extra time per game. Your deck type will largely determine whether going first or second is preferred, or if it matters little to not at all...and some cards can even manipulate the number of times you use it. This 'hero power' is actually known as evolving your followers in this game. They get the +2/+2 or whatever modified stat boost if they are some special card, and sometimes some special effect while evolving...and they will not be affected by summoning sickness...but still won't have haste/storm. It's essentially the same as having rush, but they don't call it having rush for some reason. They actually call haste/charge storm, and storm followers can go for the leader(player's life/health) right away while rush followers can only attack other followers.Arena mode is pretty interesting since the game gives you arena tickets at times so you can try out the various cards. Also, if you are dedicated enough, you can complete more daily quests in this game than in Hearthstone...they are perhaps as difficult to complete at times as the Magic Duels quests, and other times they are easier if you just happen to be lucky.The multiplayer experience could use some loving, particularly in the animations blocking out the turn time area. Shortened animations option in the menu only seems to apply to leaders, and not to followers, and followers have a habit of being show-hogs. It has a ways to go to match Hearthstone in sheer gaming functionality, but it's straight up far more playable  than Magic Duels.",Thu Mar 25 18:22:15 EET 2021,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

Some legendary (super rare) cards literally have everything. There are moments where you or the enemy plays one card in early or mid game and the opponent or you respectively can just surrender. No counterplays, no thinking. Just praying for those few cards to pop up. People said the developer ""destroyed"" a good game with the updates, but I played 40 hours in this version (Dawnbreak/Nightedge) of the game. And there just one thing to tell about it:It's utter trash.So don't waste your precious lifetime playing this if you don't plan to spend 10 bucks on a winning deck that actually is a no-brainer (because all winning decks are).

I was let down by the lack of monstergirls and futas but I'm over it now.  The gameplay is also very good.  The game is easily as good as Hearthstone if not better.  It boasts an evolve system where you can increase most followers attack and health by 2/2.  A few followers have abilities that activate on evolve as well.  There are 7 classes that all have unique mechanics built into them.  Overall I quite like this game I came for the waifus and stayed for the gameplay.In the words of Kripparian, turns out it's pretty good.

8a762ac3-5634-4cf2-ad17-fbcf49ca7900,6,"WOW. Cygames has demonstrated astounding levels of artistry in terms of card design and game balance.Like any other competitive card game, you have your tier one decks. But they do not dominate the ladder in a way that is restrictive to people who want to experiment or play lower tier decks (provided you're a decent player, and willing to actually try to build optimal strategies).Though only two expansions have been released at the time of writing this review, both have introduced powerful and interesting cards into the meta that create new and powerful tier 1 strategies, but do not break and dominate the game.Not to mention, arena 'Take Two' is an elegant take on drafting, and the arena meta has been quite fun and healthy.The flavor of the game isn't really my style, but the art is far from ugly. Visuals are well-crafted, and I find myself often interested or amused by the flavor text displayed during the loading screens in-between matches.Of course it's hard to talk about the merits of Shadowverse without bringing up the Hearthstone comparison. As a long-time Hearthstone player with multiple Legend finishes, I can safely say that I'm moving to Shadowverse, at least for the time being. It simply lacks the problems that have been plaguing Hearthstone since the introduction of 'Standard' mode: Cygames is willing to take risks in card design and encourage decks that feel different from one another, and is willing to make relatively quick adjustments to game balance if something goes wrong.I cannot sing enough praise for this game, as someone who plays or played many TCGs and CCGs actively and competitively, I can say without-a-doubt that Shadowverse is quite the achievement, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.Oh, and don't let anyone tell you that you can't play this game competitively for free; be smart with how you liquify cards and spend your in-game currency, and you can easily build top-tier decks within days of one another.",Tue Nov 09 02:29:13 EET 2021,ca06d2a9-c018-4cd6-86b2-e8d15511ec84

It's a really good card game, the classes are very diverse, it's not a Blizzard-Cashcow, it feels balanced, it's fun (at times) and generous, can't complain about that, but seriously: ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!The Campaigns are frustratingly difficult at times, some decktypes just seem so awefully bad compared to others and the bad topdecks in this game will be on your side while your enemy crushes you over and over again. Especially in the Single Player Mode. By the way: The Single Player is aweful as hell anyway. The dialogs are cringe-worthyly bad! And the AI is unfair as hell, having some seriously overpowered cards more than 3 times in their deck (3 being the maximum for the player). I can't tell of the multiplayer experience is any better, I highly hope it is, but I am not sure if I want to find out since at this point I am more willing to force a cactus into my butt than to play another minute of this game!

However, it's also really easy to get materials for card and free card packs. I usually get enough extras to liquify in order to create new legendaries that come out each expansion. I can't remember the last time I paid for something that wasn't just a skin (eg, special cardpack with special art)I started to play Shadowverse during beta when it was still mobile-only. The only way I could play it was using an emulator which had graphical lag and would crash all the time.

The game has a nice pace of giving off a pack of card for the players which is vital to ccg kind of a game. The gameplay itself isn't bad. I think what makes ccg fun to play is that stroke of luck by drawing that certain card that wins you the match and this game has that. If we're talking about the balance of the card, it is pretty much balance, unless you got really really unlucky. You can experience this if you spend a certain period of time playing the game.For additional insight, I have experienced a so-called meta in this game. But rest assure, the meta itself actually doesn't feel so bad. It is just that you could be bored when you encounter a certain people with the same kind of meta. I mean, if you can find something else to create with your own deck, why even bother following some meta (except if you're really obsessed with the victory, not the fun in building a deck).Overall it is nice and that's it, since this is a f2p game, it doesn't hurt to try.",Mon Nov 30 07:40:59 EET 2020,e118c73b-816c-4313-9ae2-84ac32ed0024

The cards look good and some of them is worth a glimpse or too. The card game seems to be well balanced, you can have fun with it, and later you want to play more. It does not feel like grinding, and the stories are well built up. It is recommended to play through all the character stories for more reasons, like learning how the decks work, and to understand what is going on exactly. In each story, I have encountered an enemy that was too strong to defeat on first try and needed to play a few times to achieve victory. I used the basic story deck, but you can create a completely new one and use that in the story mode. You can even link the game to your mobile phone, to play portable. The game surprises you with good bonuses and with the holidays here you get even more, which I felt really appreciated. Pros:- Nice graphics and animations- Story looks interesting- Nice bonuses- No griding feeling yet- You don’t have to spend real money to build up some decent decks- Can be linked to mobile- Has active multiplayer- Own decks can be built and customized easily- Frequently upcoming new contentsCons:- Each story mode has a difficult enemy on later stage (this is fine for me)- After completing almost all the stories you can get annoyed of the conversations you already heard- Decks can be sometimes confusing- Multiplayer can be hard, but you need to try regardless- The extra evolution point for the 2nd player seems to be a big advantage",Mon Oct 25 20:36:42 EEST 2021,0fb0a90b-0f06-41fa-b9af-2b7aabd1332f

e96a1bf4-5625-41e6-a68b-c5f0e0cb26a8,3,Excellent card game with constant special events and expansions that actually add new ways to play or improve current decks instead of making favourite less vaiable to use. Also they just released a new expansion and pretty interesting their giving some power to neutral cards in a way that I think a lot of people will find refreshing. The developers are always tweaking things and making changes when particular cards or decks are starting to limit the deck building or gameplay with the added touch of giving you more vials when you disenchant cards. To add the new player curve is really easy to overcome they give u a lot of free packs I've never spent money and I'm on a pretty even playing grounds with those who probably do. So all in all it's a great game and it's free to play in the more positive sense so there's no reason not to download it and start conversing with the Shadows!

e96a1bf4-5625-41e6-a68b-c5f0e0cb26a8,3,"I've been a fan of card games for a long time now. I've played Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh, MTG, Krosmaga and probably every other game out there. Many of them are really good but have that one big flaw. You have to spend A LOT of money to play competitively.Not Shadowverse though.I've been playing for about 170h as of the 1st of July and I haven't spent a dime. I have all the important cards and can play on a high level, slowly but steadily approching Master rank. Cygames gives out a lot of packs which makes the game a lot more interesting as you have more cards to play with and thus more dekcs to try out.Last Expansion was a little static and quite boring, due to the same 4-5 decks being played all the time, but nerfs came through pretty quickly and made it better. Now with the new expansion Wonderland Dreams, the game got a lot more diverse and fun.The anime aestethics might not be everyones cup of tea, but if you can ignore that and the fact that the game itself feels a little clumsy due to it being a mobile port, Shadowverse is a great game for card game lovers that doesn't try to take your money out of your pockets.Tl:drGreat game.

7681e8a1-55d2-4323-95b0-754ef1d38985,1," ''It's Hearthstone with waifus! Haha. Give me thumbs up :)'' This is all i saw when i scrolled through the reviews. There are a few actual good reviews but not many that are really serious or helpful. The ones that are helpful usually compare the game to Heathstone as well, but instead give an actual review with it. With all the comparisons with Hearthstone and other card games it may be hard to judge if you want to give this game a try if you, just like me, never played a digital card game before. This review is not for people that are pretty familiar with digital card games but if you want a full first experience of a person that never played one, you might want to stick around to see if it is something you are interested in as well. My experience with card games so far So first things first: I always wanted to play a digital card game because it looked fun but i have never seen any that interested me enough to actually download one. Heartstone for example did not look interesting to me at all because it is set in the WoW universe, which i have never played before. Not wanting to dive deep into unknown territory i looked for some card games on Steam but they were either poorly made or a cash grab. Losing the interest in looking for games and not having time to browse the internet for hours, i gave up. That is until one day this gem appeared out of thin air on Steam's front page. Apperantly it was an app that was available on mobile for a while now and has recently been ported to the PC. Seeing it had the ''Anime'' tag, my inner weeb got triggered (im not really a weeb guys i just like anime, ok?) and i downloaded the game.  First impressions  Skip this if you don't enjoy salt and / or just don't care about my story My first impressions were actually quite good. I really enjoyed the artwork and the voice acting was on point as well (for a voice-over, game has Japanese devs). The tutorial was good and taught me some basic things about card games which was nice because i had never played one before. After finishing the tutorial the game gave me some rewards and told me to try one of the class stories (i will return to this topic later), which i did. After a small bit of story telling the game put me in yet another tutorial, this time a class tutorial to teach me how the class works that im playing. It explained it fairly well and i started my first mission. I beat my opponent fairly easily (the AI was pretty dumb and had reduced health), and started the next one. The 2nd one was a bit harder but i still won. The 3rd one was also not really a problem since i was now starting to understand digital card games a bit more. When i got to the 6th mission however, this all changed. The AI was no longer bad or had reduced health and destroyed me 3 times in a row. Getting more and more frustrated by the minute i decided to try my hands on the deck building that apperantly was needed to progress since the default decks aren't that great. I had absolutely no clue what i was doing for about half an hour. Having become even more frustrated in the mean time, i made my first mistake... i tried to beat the 6th mission again, with my new ''deck''. My deck at the time was... terrible to say the least. I got beaten easily by an AI opponent again multiple times and at times when i almost beat him he would do some very (and i mean VERY) cheap move which would lead to my defeat yet again and wanting me to throw my PC out the window. This is where i made my second mistake: i closed the game out of anger and didn't touch it for at least a day. After doing a lot of research in the mean time, i began giving up hope that card games would be something that i would enjoy playing because they were extremely difficult. After a day or so i completely forgot about the game but quickly saw it again in my library. Wanting to give it one last shot i started the game up again. This is where things changed though, i was now learning a lot more from research than actually playing and i managed to progress further into the story. Instead of trying the 7th mission and risking getting frustrated again i tried playing one of the other classes to see if they were any better. Good lord they were better. I managed to finish two whole class stories before returning to that hellish 7th one from the first class. Trying it over and over but still not managing to beat it i decided to leave it where it was. My experience now 20 hours later and i have still not beaten that 7th mission. I don't know if it's my deck or just the class im playing as (forestcraft if you want to know), but i find it to be nearly impossible. I finished some of the other class stories, enjoyed some a lot, others not that much, and also tried some pvp. I will have to say that this game is absolutely amazing. The artwork is beautiful, the classes feel very unique and the animations are cool as well. It was hard to learn at first but i spend some time doing research and watching videos and while i still don't understand everything that well i have to say that im doing a lot better now than i did before (im even able to make my own decks now without giving myself brain damage). If you never played a card game before you might want to have some knowledge first so you don't feel like punching your PC like i did sometimes. The game is not that hard if you know the basics and it's a lot of fun to play the stories of the different classes instead of just having pvp or meaningless AI in some other card games (however pvp in this game is very good as well). The devs are very generous with rewards and you will be able to make a good deck fairly easily from the start if you have the knowledge to do so. Classes Time to talk about the classes. There are currently 7 classes in Shadowverse, each one feeling completely unique and playing entirely different. If you want to know what each class does you really have to try them for yourself but i will try to give a brief explanation: Forestcraft  focusses on playing a lot of weak, low-cost fairies in order to boost other cards and overwhelm your opponent. Swordcraft  has cards that can summon other (weak) allies when played and strengthen them according to their role (officer and commander). Currently my favorite class. Runecraft  specializes in playing spells in order to strenghten other spells currently in your hand. Dragoncraft  has cards that allow you to get more points (which are needed to play cards) to get to late game quickly and boost your cards with the ''overflow'' ability when you do so. Shadowcraft  gains shadows when allies die or when certain cards are played, which are consumed in order to make other cards more powerful when they are played. Bloodcraft  has many cards that damage your leader in order to get below 50% health so your ''vengance'' ability activates which gives certain cards a massive advantage. Currently my least favorite class. Havencraft  has amulets that summon powerful allies when they are destroyed. Havencraft also is the best class at healing allies and your leader and is able to destroy their own amulets faster with certain cards.Each class also has their own story which is quite interesting and gives them a personality instead of just being a blank and uninteresting face. Cards Steam thinks my review is getting too long so i have to keep this one short. All you have to know is that the devs are very generous with rewards. They also had some issues and delays in the past so all new players will be rewarded with 40 FREE card packs right from the start, which is a massive help. Now to quickly finish thing off there are some things i either forgot to mention or just didn't mention because others did like 10 times before me. Very fun game, may take some time to learn but it's well worth it.",Sun Feb 28 19:30:59 EET 2021,3be98189-b41f-44ca-b2ce-51cfd1f88469

507c4562-16f7-4ad9-85ac-04b7c738de48,8,"P2W vs Hearthstone: Either very (generous / heinous). Booster packs are somewhat 'fair', with rates for each card revealed officially. Many bronze/silver tier cards are viable. However there are 2~3 really powerful class legendaries that you (want to / have to) stuff the deck with full three copies for serious jump in win rates - Game allows you to buy the same starter deck three times for that reason more or less.Gameplay: Some matchups can be very stagnant. They do their own thing, you do yours, and maybe once every three turns Haven and Rune will react to your turn. Hell, if the game let them do it, I'm sure they'd throw single target removals against an empty board out of force of habit. Aggro Swordcraft floods the board every turn and doesn't care how you deal with it, but at least there is a war of attrition to be fought there. In the end everything is balanced because everything is OP, sort of. Except poor fairies, combo system isn't friendly to them yet.Audiovisual: You're playing this instead of Hearthstone because of dem waifus. Illustrations are large enough to appreciate them as CCGs tend to be.Overall: Nice distraction, probably worth investing a few starter decks, good fun being in the middle of the pack playing suboptimal decks, but the climb to top isn't appealing.",Mon Jul 20 08:26:24 EEST 2020,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4

The cards look good and some of them is worth a glimpse or too. The card game seems to be well balanced, you can have fun with it, and later you want to play more. It does not feel like grinding, and the stories are well built up. It is recommended to play through all the character stories for more reasons, like learning how the decks work, and to understand what is going on exactly. In each story, I have encountered an enemy that was too strong to defeat on first try and needed to play a few times to achieve victory. I used the basic story deck, but you can create a completely new one and use that in the story mode. You can even link the game to your mobile phone, to play portable. The game surprises you with good bonuses and with the holidays here you get even more, which I felt really appreciated. Pros:- Nice graphics and animations- Story looks interesting- Nice bonuses- No griding feeling yet- You donâ€™t have to spend real money to build up some decent decks- Can be linked to mobile- Has active multiplayer- Own decks can be built and customized easily- Frequently upcoming new contentsCons:- Each story mode has a difficult enemy on later stage (this is fine for me)- After completing almost all the stories you can get annoyed of the conversations you already heard- Decks can be sometimes confusing- Multiplayer can be hard, but you need to try regardless- The extra evolution point for the 2nd player seems to be a big advantage",Sun Oct 11 12:00:26 EEST 2020,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1

With effort, you can get a great experience without spending any money, however if you can afford it, it may be worth a few bucks for either some card packs or even some fun optional stuff like fancy customization. I noticed last expansion it took them a bit too long to nerf stuff that made the game unbalanced but they seem to have done much better with the new Wonderland one, which doesn't seem to present any major problems or inbalances as I can tell. It's really cool cuz cards are voiced, some by cool voice actors. You can change the language of the voice acting too if you want. Also the card art is freaking gorgeous and awesome. As an art nerd it's one of my favourite parts. I also really like how basically any deck is obtainable with enough effort. Any card is craftable, though of course the better ones take some effort.

c67c513a-c232-461f-aa36-f1c1a78db91c,6,"Hello, avid tcg player here who has played almost every card game to date intensively and at top level. Here is my verdict for Shadowverse after having played in A+ tier every day for over 1 month. First of all, I am writing this review because I feel that Shadowverse is extremely overrated. You can tell by other reviews that the people reviewing it have either barely played it OR do not have full knowledge of all the existing card games out there, how much luck is involved in them vs requiring actual strategy, and how stale the gameplay is at top tier level (meaning the amount of viable decks that you can play with + cards which you can tech into them). I feel like a lot of people are giving this game too much credit due to the seemingly generous introduction which the game offers, giving you 40 packs right off the bat. The negatives are also not noticeable at low tier ranked games (B and below), so everything seems great right? To be fair, I would've written a positive review for this game aswell early on. But I stuck around for the long haul, and boy am I disappointed with it. The following bit will cover the key parts of the gameplay which makes me give this game a negative review.!!!!!Going second has too many advantages!!!!!So there are some stat nerds who just love to throw ""but going first had 60% win rate before the changes, it's much better now!"" in your face when you state this fact, but what they do not realize is that Darkness Evolved introduced a bunch of cards which made going second on par for every leader with going first already tempo/combo wise. Not only that; it also opened up new combos with the base cards which makes those super aggro decks not viable to play at all now @top tier. This set was either barely released or yet to be released when the 60% win rate for going first was determined, when Cygames made these changes which now heavily benefits the person going second. Here are the advantages for going second:-You draw an extra card-You get 1 more evolution orb (crucial for turning the game around)-You get to evolve first (this is the gamebreaking part)But that's not all. I mentioned that this game is very stale when it comes to strategic options. For anything other than super aggro *go straight for the leader* deck builds, there are barely any cards in most top tier constructed decks which let you make full use of your play points every turn, which is vital for going first. That crucial turnaround extra evolution which the player going second gets turns into a flat out advtantage already if there is nothing to turn around. As an example of a game phase, it's going to be very hard as the player going first already if you don't start with a 1 point cost card @turn 1.And not only that, the advantages of going first also get negated by plenty of instant impact cards (which do something the turn that you play them) and turn the match into player going 2nd's favour early on already. Few examples are:-Elf Child May (cost 1, does 1 damage to opponent follower, 1/1 field presence, forest)-Sylvan Strike (cost 2, deal 2 damage to opponent follower, put 1/1 fairy in hand, forest)-Whole-Souled Swing (cost 2, deal 2 damage to opponent follower, spawn 1/1 knight on field if you have less creatures on field than opponent when playing this card - this is always the case when going 2nd and playing vs aggro, sword)-Magic Missile (cost 2, deal 1 damage and draw a card, rune)-Kaleido (cost 2, return a 2 point cost or less card to the owners hand and draw a card, rune)-Fire Lizard (cost 2, deal 1 damage to opponent follower, 2/1 field presence, dragon)-Blazing Breath (cost 1, deal 2 damage to opponent follower, dragon)-Angelic Barrage (cost 3, deal 1 damage to all opponent followers, all decks)Cards like these will prevent player 1 from having any kind of advantage, since there is a severe lack of instant impact early game (turn 1-4) cards available right now. Quickblade (sword) is ok but can be dealt with too easily, Wolf works well due to the nature of the deck that it is used in + stats of other cards (hope and pray for no Angelic Barrage if all field presence = 1 defence), and Pinion/Aria's amulet status + a countdown reduction card like Dogma allows for a strong start if you're not playing vs Runecraft like:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=822418799Normally, if opponent decides to take out all of your creatures with theirs, you'll have 1-2 remaining on the field by the end of turn 3 and maybe did a few points of damage to them. But then they get to evolve and put up one of those 4 cost power cards; a strong creature like Floral or Bishop. This curve suits 2nd player too perfectly with the play points vs cost of those cards, and being in a situation where you can use them since evolved creatures have Rush (can attack opponent creature on the same turn). The only cards for player going first which can deal with this evolved creature on turn 5 = Dance of Death, Demonic Strike, Will of the Forest (forest leader only), 2 storm cards (gives opponent 2 for 1 value though), + a few more 3+ insta damage cards. Almost none of these cards are used x3 in any deck so the odds of you having them in your hand at that moment = low. So, you will likely be forced into evolving one of your own creatures to take it out because your opponent will likely be able to retain field control + do damage every turn and finish the game at turn 7-8 if you don't.Atm, the complete opposite goes for player going first if they also have such cards in their hand. They either have to waste a turn if they don't have anything else in their hand which they can play (remember they have 1 card less, so less to pick from) OR play a card like Fire Lizard/Healing Angel without being able to make use of its effect (no creature on opponents field, no use for healing early on since your opponent hasn't started to damage you yet and is focusing on keeping their life as high as possible + trying to keep field control equal until they can activate advantage of their evo power card which the game is currently offering by letting them evolve first). All power evolve cards cost 4 or 3 points though, so you will likely waste 1 play point here (having a 1 cost card to fill it up with at this point woudn't even be desired) aka it won't be a perfect curve.Storm/insta damage cards let you sort of bypass this because they'll atleast do some damage to your opponent before being removed, which lets you work towards barely getting your opponents life down to 0 which will likely cost you all of your cards to do so aswell, and then rip if opponent has sufficient heals or throws up a ward if you only have a storm card left in your hand. And that is why Bloodcraft is currently the only succesful deck which can still manage to go first without being gimped under these circumstances.Past the mid point of the game, there is only one thing you can hope for if the early game hasn't been in your advantage: You drawing into those big late gameish gold/legendary cards while your opponent draws into weak (at that stage of the game) early game cards which don't provide enough resistance or damage to deal with said gold/legendary cards. If it doesn't happen then you just flat out lose. So basically that comes down to pure luck, which is too big a factor in the game atm. There is less luck involved with Poker than with this game right now; and you know that a tcg is bad when that is the case. Tcgs should always have more strategy involved than with Poker, which is known as the game where luck matters most. So the Shadowverse ""About this game"" description stating that this is the most tactically rich CCG on the market is just a big lie.See comments for closing words.",Fri Dec 31 11:58:57 EET 2021,ca1ff695-dea6-4f34-a662-1345f301eef4
c67c513a-c232-461f-aa36-f1c1a78db91c,4,"If I had to describe Shadowverse for me... it's like that abusive relationship you just can't seem to get out of it. You know the gacha is salty. You know the grind is real. You know it eats away at you. You know it is pay to win. You know the battles are excruciatingly frustrating.  You know there is some SERIOUS balancing issues. Yet, I'm still masochistic enough to keep going with the relationship. It's just only on the outside the relationship looks pretty with the art and voices.Okay. Truthfully, if you like this kind of card games with an anime art, then go ahead and play. It can't hurt to try. But It's mainly RNG in the battles and the packs. RNG to get the right cards you need to win or counter. So I guess the only strategy is playing with cards you're given with if you didn't get a good spread or if both players get ideal spread. But really when your opponent can get all the necessary cards in 4 turns there is something wrong. It's not strategy in my opinion. Some people say the rate for legendaries (highest rarity) are high, but note that you need 3 of the same copies and sometimes multiple legendaries. Same goes for gold (second highest rarity). You can get crap legendaries and gold. Vials are not nearly enough to make a deck for the most part. So this is where the credit card comes out. If you want go ahead and spend money, then it's your choice. With that said, I'm not sure how in the world someone who is starting and F2P going to catch up to 6 expansion packs? You also need a working deck for every lead, so that's a lot of cards. I mean when you do get a semi-solid deck with all the necessary cards it can be kind of enjo- Anyways, the relationship without a doubt is pretty tough. F2P good luck and those willing to pay go on ahead and play and have fun.  ",Wed Jan 22 21:47:27 EET 2020,23674e7d-b990-4e48-9e33-89999a6ca8d0

d0b844fe-7978-4382-b2d0-c64fc6edfd6f,6,"Back when the game was released on Steam it used to be an interesting concept with nice looking art and lots of free packs to keep the player entertained without having to pay anything and remain competitive which made the game popular in certain circles. As time went on it became duller and duller since there wasn't much strategy other than drawing the right cards or playing aggressively and preying on the opponents bad luck. But we accepted it and expected the game to expand and fix itself. (God, how innocent we were)Time went on and contrary to everyone's expectations they didn't fix the core problem of the game and just added more powercreeps just to nerf them (or at least part of it) after a couple of months later leaving the terrible aftertaste of what is this game about anymore or what can we expect from the future. Of course it just got worse with the time until everyone that had a slight chance of interest on it gave up and went away.To summarize the game it's basically a heavily luck based, go first, curve it out and dominate sort of play with a few exceptions that are barely playable these days. The comeback factor is very flimsy as you probably can count in your hand the times you really felt like you actually used a smart strategy to fool your opponent and get the best of it. No opponent hand destruction, no traps, no control mechanics at all. Drop followers (minions, creatures etc) and do your worst that's the game. Also plenty of spells can deal damage to the player health so you can exploit that too. The absurd amount of cheap kills and highly annoying cards that can snowball your game or just dumb stuff that can simply autowin when played (ahem, Eachtar) only makes Shadowverse a terrible and stressful experience either when you win or when you lose. No balance allowed! must be their motto. Most of the time you simply get a better hand go face (player health) and the opponent concedes. The card game feel is completely nonexistent and it feels like a grinder, a cute anime girl parade grinder. Exactly like, you know, those puzzle block games you meddle around with your smartphone for quick time killing brainless fun... which is exactly what the devs always wanted this game to be from the very beginning if you read their interviews. Guess we just had the wrong expectations from this (?) who knows.Anyway, let it rot. All the time I wasted on this wasn't worth at all and surely the same will be true for you.

The people designing the cards just seem to have so much trouble keeping them balanced.For reference to how bad the problem of unbalanced overpowered cards became, the devs announced that they were going to do monthly balance changes not too long ago. I know a lot of people agree with the idea, but a full release card game that people put real money into, where you release an expansion every THREE months needs balance changes every SINGLE month? You need to keep changing things even after a single nerf wave following an expansion? It's a bit of a testament to how bad their balance philosophy is; they change powerful cards just make other cards even more unbalanced. It's completely out if hand and a little overwhelming, to be honest. They also do these really strange and out of place crossovers, like with street fighter. Kind of just wish they could have kept the integrity of the standalone universe. But that's a personal preference.

I got fairly high up the ranks, built a couple of decent decks and was generally having a decent time until I got to the p[oint where every opponent I faced had legendary after legendary, and losing just wasn't fun. One of the characters has a card so you lose your next turn for example, and I find that kind of thing incredibly boring.The final straw came because this game comes with stuff that likes to run in the background at all times too and I don't like that kind of thing, especially if I've paid for content and supported the devs/publisher. Leeching my bandwidth that I pay a premium for is unacceptable, and whether it's spyware or not I don't care.

It runs 60fps too.Definitely not some crap games that makes you pay $10 to shoot a deer. Every card is carefully designed to a degree that they are good by themselves. (probably not fairies, but they don't go to your collection right?) Technically not a pay-to-win game at least in the first few months. What to do?Melt all other cards for 1 or 2 battle deck, then you are set with only luck matters.But at the next release patch you probably need to buy cards again...Cons-This game is swarmed with Asian. well i am an Asian too, I am just considering Asian commuity very committed to make decks for the win. As a result you probably run into similar weird opponents extremely often (such as low cost necro, [Yui Chan's voice is the best!]) and get crashed with a normal-style deck.Developers aren't smart with money farming. They leave some SSR cards with bugged stats so people go buy them for win. Of course that bug will be fixed and the money would be wasted for many people.Ultimately a pay-to-win game requring long term investiment. Your deck is severely limited if you paid too little (I do not complain about paying, you need to know how to pay to let people make you good games).Large investiment usually brings frustration in card games, so be careful.----Some usless suggestions----Developers could make weekly subscription decks so people would shuffle their cards just for fun. Make Co-op Raids, Just like GranBlueFantasy, with player teams dualing with Raid Boss. With an entraince ticket (from take-two?). for a reward of some vials or even special cards.wish it's helpful.",Tue Dec 28 19:57:58 EET 2021,7078ed50-8de2-4b84-8eed-6a706a64a26a

Great solo story mode, very generous start (50 decks and a lot of currency) so that you can reroll if you don't have good stuff (8 cards per deck. thats a lot of cards trust me.) only downside is just like all the other TCGs, default decks are VERY bad. make your own or stop crying.10/10",Sat Aug 14 02:58:51 EEST 2021,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

Story mode, which is designed for you to get to know each craft, or deck playstyle (almost like a class system) has drunk the unnecessarily hard ai Kool-Aid brought on by dark souls. Prepare to be given a pre-made deck that has the class basics but none of the advanced cards while facing an ai who has advanced or expert versions of their own decks. This makes the tip of ""play of other leaders to understand their playstyle"" that pops up if you lose a duel useless. Oh, you can't modify these story mode decks so you will understand the meaning of insanity if you make it through all of what the story mode offers.I have done up to Luna 7th duel where she faces Eris. Problem? Eris is the perfect counter to my deck. Everything I do, she has a counter to. Oh she has a monster that will be summoned in 4 turns? Too bad because anything you summon to bull rush her will get banished or she will flood the field with shield monsters so punishment for her over-extensions are non-existent.

b6360cb1-ec89-4222-b5c6-cd322bdce3a5,10,"Oh what a ride it was! I was playing Horizon on the PS4 back when it was initially released and have to admit that I was not hooked at first. 

After all this time and a lot of updates I decided to go for the steam version because I really liked the protagonist. I can not stress enough how immersed I was in this beautiful world. 

The story was absolutely great and highly interesting and goes very deep into questions of our modern world: Artificial Intelligence, Machines, Computer technology- replacing the need of human hands and minds in so many areas. 
The way Guerrilla Games presents this story and delivers explanations, timeline details and character information is absolutely outstanding. The pacing feels a little bit slow in the beginning but makes a lot of sense in regards to the overall story arc. Don`t be fooled by the beautiful aesthetic of this game. The story is actually quite grim and really lets you think about some questions of life and death if you are willing to. The side characters are believable, strongly developed, interesting and highly diverse. 

In terms of gameplay I felt that the combat was super responsive and addictive. The more you try out new weapons and tools the more of a badass machine-killing huntress you become. I felt, that the skill tree was not very impactful though and would have wished for a more diverse approach in regards to RPG elements. (Focus on melee, stealth, bow and arrow, precision kills etc.)  Especially since I have almost unlocked every single skill. 

But nevertheless Aloy is an outstanding character and I am so happy Sony decided to go for a female protagonist for a change. 

In the end I highly appreciate Horizon Zero Dawn and will have to buy a PS5 after Christmas so that I can go for the 2nd part of Aloys adventure - into the ""Forbidden West""",Sat Feb 15 17:57:28 EET 2020,57dd8aba-2187-4c4e-99ad-b42bdc91d5d5

Despite claiming that they would not design cards like this anymore, Cygames continues to do so. Rune, Forest, Dragon, and Sword are all now fielding decks that either go straight for the face with turn 6 storm lethal or they play severely undercosted cards that simultaneously clear the opponent's board and generate face damage. Cards that have been design space problems since their release (i.e. roach, Sibyl) continue to be the backbone of degenerate decktypes because Cygames refuses to nerf them. While Cygames claims that the game is becoming more balanced due to equalizing win/loss ratios, the reality is that this is only happening because games are increasingly decided by the luck of the draw: with cards like this, every game simply snowballs out of control.

b6360cb1-ec89-4222-b5c6-cd322bdce3a5,10,"Ok, I am in a mood for some card games or something like that. I like collecting stuff and puzzle, strategy etc. games in general. So I tried this one. I will start with my initial difficulties and problems, then I will mention what I like and then why I don´t want to play anymore.It has only 100 MB? Cool. Ok, so it´s downloaded. Oh wait, now it started downloading additional stuff... 30 minutes later... Ok. Why can´t I turn this on full screen? Oh, on the forums they say that is possible only after completing the tutorial... Why? Let´s play. Oh wait, I changed my mind. I want English subtitles and Japanese voice acting... Oh, you cannot change that either until you finish tutorial. Uninstall and once more all the patching. Ok, now we can play... Now I want to know what English VAs sound like. Oh, they download the audio pack every time you change it...I like how addicting the gameplay can get. The art, the voices and music are all amazing. The game could use some quality of life changes (by that I mean it should behave like it´s on PC, some parts are unnecessarily clunky). And then we get to the core of the issue. Since it´s F2P (hey, they got to make money somehow, I am not disputing that) there are various cosmetic and also non-cosmetic items to buy with multiple currencies, some of which can be bought for real money. You get seemingly generous amount of packs for free for the start. You also get some cards at the start of the game. The issue with that is the number of factions these card packs are linked to. So you are not going to get all that many for one faction. Add to that the possible doubles and special coll looking animated cards, which add even more chance of doubles. It is card collectible, so you either pay or grind (and wait), or something in between. The learning curve is quite steep. You have very little knowledge about strategy, synergies (due to the sheer number of cards your opponents pull out of their asses). The simple fact is the longer you play the better variety of cards and strategies (and also you can actually put together a complete deck which you kind of can´t at the start).In the end, this leads to you battling people who are more experienced, have better cards and complete decks and who use stuff you do not yet know exists until it hits your face (which can end in your sudden defeat in like two turns). I look at the other reviews saying the RNG is not that bad here, however in my eyes it is still insane. Your opponent can have a lot of (for you) new things. Add to this few multiplayer battles the singleplayer journey, which is cool but still mostly a series of set pieces for battles (where you can face again complete decks with your incomplete one), the usual daily logins and shiny unpacking... Oh yeah and the story translations are a bit off (I know enough Japanese for me to say that myself).I do not hate this game, in fact I would like to love it quite a lot. I just can´t. The initial difficulties, the trappings of the infinite F2P and the vision I would have to spend dozens of hours over the course of many days to even get few decent decks for more than one faction just make me conclude my time could be better spent elsewhere. I can see why people like it. I for myself cannot recommend it. It´s free though, so try it for yourselves.",Mon Aug 02 12:57:44 EEST 2021,7caf5a6f-eadd-476c-be13-0153988f1a50

Lots of beautiful asthetics.Loads of cards with expansions coming out regularly so you have plenty of decks to choose from.Story mode is quite engaging and has plenty of rewards for early players so they can get startedThey give you loads of booster packs to begin with so you can actually get a deck going for yourself so they offer quite a lot to new players.Cons - Despite everything they do for new players. You will be having to put money into the game to even start winning any games. They do give you loads of boosters to start but that does NOT mean they will give you cards that you can work with. Because of the different classes in cards your decks will always be missing cards to them for the decks to even work. You run into constant players who have these clean cut decks filled with the cards they need to win or reach their win condition. I cannot see any new person coming into this game and getting anywhere when it comes to playing against other players. Good luck to those of you who struggle to make a deck and successfully do without spending money. Terrible match making. While doing some pvp I find myself battling against people who are double my rank which is completely insane!Repeatetive. Eventually after fighting against more and more players you'll find that each person will be running decks that are quite the same. Mostly brainless decks that they copy from someone else online so they can just run it and win. It gets boring pretty quickly. Despite all they do for new players. It is not enough. They also seem to pump out more and more expansions quickly which probably means this game is more of a cash grab since you will probably buy the packs just to stay relevant. I've had this game for months and I have not had 1 completed deck so far because I can never get the cards i need from the packs.

Cygames is really generous with their free stuff, which makes this probably the most free to play-friendly CCG right now. With two of the power cards nerfed, deck building got somewhat meaningful again, it's just generally a much more fun experience again.If you seek a more japanese-ish CCG with expansions every 3 months and a dark fantasy atmosphere but with minimal RNG involved, this is the perfect fit for you!",Wed Mar 31 08:54:01 EEST 2021,ef5b8a11-d0a2-4c91-9162-22326633b5ef
32756883-1f11-47e9-9ca1-991bbe439e33,2,"I wanted to like this game. Afterall, I've been playing Hearthstone for a while now so I should be able to enjoy another card game like Shadowverse. Sadly, that is not the case. So far I've finished main story on forestcraft and dabble on few chapters of all the other craft. And already I'm having this sinking feeling about this game.The most important thing about a card game is balance. Which is, understandably very hard to achieve. Especially when suits in your company is badgering the developing team to push out more cards and sales. Either way, about 5 chapters into swordcraft, I'm starting to notice some terrible design choices such as the amulet. Amulet, what seems to me like a class of card virtually untouchable may sometimes carry terrible consequences. The problem is, unlike hearthstone, for which the dev clearly stated and showed their intention to design a game with interaction in mind (i.e: such as avoiding putting a card too op that the opposing player would lose for sure once the card enters the field and doesn't have time to respond), the Amulet in Shadowverse clearly is one of the poorly designed cards. I just don't see how cards like Heretical Inquiry or Death Sentence could possibly made it through testing and into public. They're cost 2 and 4 respectively and only takes 1 turn to come into effect. And considering the fact that you can't just attack an amulet directly, once opponent plays that card it's pretty much goodbye board and gg.In Hearthstone, while nobody sane could say that luck is never part of the game, there is enough options that a skilled player could time his offense and defense so that they win more than they lose. Looking at cards like amulet, I can't help but feel that the same options is missing here.TL;DR: If you want to see some neat art and card animation but doesn't care much for balance, give this game a try. But if you're serious card game player and want a balanced card game to fill your time, I'd still recommend Hearthstone over Shadowverse.",Fri Dec 11 00:57:12 EET 2020,2ecab58b-f21b-4d17-aba8-868091ecd60f
32756883-1f11-47e9-9ca1-991bbe439e33,1,"I've only played a short while so far, but what I can say thus far is that - if you can put up with occasionally over-the-top and edgy artwork - the gameplay is solid and actually has some very interesting and new mechanical ideas, viz. the evolve mechanics which allow you to (generally) empower a creature and the Storm ability (think MtG Haste) versus Rush (Haste but only able to attack creatures, aka ""followers"" - this ability is also given by evolve). The result of these mechanics is a healthy amount of counterplay options, versus say Hearthstone and its numerous competitors. Another of the strongest aspects of this game is the relative generosity of the publisher: 10 free packs for every previous expansion and 10 free packs of the new one upon release. With login rewards of gold currency and card pack tickets in addition to daily quests that provide much the same, at no point have I felt at a complete disadvantage, even at only 4 hours in.As to the meta, I can't speak much to that because of my relative lack of experience. However, I began playing this in the previous, much-bemoaned patch and have played some with the new one and I will tentatively say that I have seen a greater variety of decks already.Considering these various aspects, it's worth a try if you're into virtual CCGs, I think.

159c1432-8687-4f1e-b6b1-b1e7688c3b28,5,"This is my favorite card game. Despite a lot of long time players complaning about it, I haven't found it as frustrating as they have. I believe the trick is to stay out of Masters to keep the game fun and exciting. So down at where I am which is about C1 there's a lot of decks you see on a daily basis. This is actually a result of the recent nerfs to Shadow and Dragon. Now, at least in my rank, it seems that almost every deck is somewhat viable. There are some things you have to know about this game and the mindset behind it. This is not Hearthstone. Hearthstone games can go way past turn 10, in this game, the devs made it so that the game should, hopefully end before turn 10 which is why so many people are complaining about OP cards. Yes those OP cards exist. No they're not designed to be unbalanced. They're designed to end games. So in a sense whoever has the upper hand while entering late game is at a big advantage.Another thing i want to talk about how this game differs from hearthstone since most shadowverse players converted from hs. Big differences: 3 copies of any card, 40 card decks, evolve, minimal rng, almost no board clear, and 20 HP faces. 3 copies of each card improves consistency by a lot. There's also almost no rng in this game except for deal X damage to a random enemy follower which when used strategically is not very rng at all. So in a way the game is much less random. As a result the plays are much more strategic. Top that with less board clear and you feel like you're actually playing a card game rather than a slot machine. In this game you're always playing towards a win condition whatever that may be and fortunately there's very few ways to turn the tables if you are severely losing unlike HS where one card can boardwipe and basically win you the game. No in this game the only cards that have that kind of power are win conditon cards which are typically 8+ mana. Why are players complaining? Well for like the last couple months there were only 2 viable decks. Everyone played them. If you play against the same deck in 80% of your games you'd probably be really bored. It was either play them or lose. Now it's better. For a player who likes playing for fun this is a great time to join. For a player who is super competetive idk. It's still probably better than HS tbh, but who knows how much. For new players. Alright so one bad thing is that this game has a bit of a diffculty cliff as a new player due to the abundant free cards you get early on. Does that sound like an oxymoron? Well as a new player who doesn't understand this particular game's meta you will probably have some trouble knowing what's good and what's bad just by looking at it. People who do know tend to reroll and end up with really strong decks at the start so prepare to feel the pain while you climb out of the noob hell. Don't climb too far though cause then you'll end up in Masters hell which is even worse. Stay in the safe zone, get some of the upcoming free packs, learn a bit, and make a deck based on what you like and be happy like me.",Mon Nov 23 21:24:04 EET 2020,72a98361-87dc-4ea6-9c5b-04ecc7bb99e1
