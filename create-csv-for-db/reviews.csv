CSGO has hit rock bottom with Valve's missed promises of game changing updates and their lack of effort to combat the terrible cheating problem. Bugs have been in the game for years and still haven't been fixed. Cheating is out of control. Over the past few years of playing, cheating has gotten worse and worse to the point now where I end up playing against a cheater almost every game. Valve implemented the new ""trust"" matchmaking system to combat some of these issues but its lackluster algorithm still somehow thinks putting me, with years of gameplay and 3,000+ hours, against people playing on brand new accounts makes sense. I really don't know why I still put the effort to play this game anymore because it usually just ends up with me regretting it. I guess I just wish I could somehow have the fun I used to have playing this game but it seems those days are long gone.",Tue Sep 21 16:00:49 EEST 2021,851fa084-272f-46c8-b86f-eecf77728c59

Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.",Tue Jun 22 15:17:34 EEST 2021,65e1dbaa-1e6f-48aa-a777-2cad8598844f

What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh!

Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",Wed Jan 22 10:12:41 EET 2020,851fa084-272f-46c8-b86f-eecf77728c59

Every 4th match is a cheater, every 2nd match u get griefers and every single, i mean EVERY single ♥♥♥♥ing match you'll see a flamer in your team constantly trying to kick you or just bully you into leaving by abusing the voice chat. The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)Bottom line is that the community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.The rest of the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥community as you possibly can.6/10year olds.",Wed Nov 24 13:37:46 EET 2021,854cc5f2-8a45-4183-bc32-b2c4a897b9e5

This review has little spoilers in it.nnVery dark game. If compared to the Inquisition, this game has way more dark elements and very... questionable choices. Tho, characters are amazing and party banter between them makes them so deep. You easily start to care about them and they are not just some characters - especially when you know you will meet them on later games even your paths might separate in the ending of this game. nnEven this game is old and graphics little bit outdated, I still enjoy this game all of my heart. I have been playing lot of older games and graphics don't really affect me, actually I enjoy the nostalgic feeling in it.nnIf i have to say something bad, it must be the how buggy this game is. You will learn fast to save all the time (just for pretty hard fights) and random crashing. Some bugs are fixable, but you will learn to live with them. Battling mechanisms are very different compare to the Inquisition, but it doesn't make this game bad. I just had to learn play differently. nnI really recommend this game for everyone, even it might be hard and tricky sometimes.nnWhen This is war started playing at end credits, I may have been crying little bit.

After 3 it started to get even more bonkers and should of ended then. In my opinion, After 3 it all went to Sh**. In this title your goal is to take over Steel Port in any way what suits you. You build reputation which gives you points to spend on upgrades of your choice. Cash is earned by doing missions and receiving income from Steel Port as you gradually take over. Cash can be spent on about everything, Cars, Guns, clothes & a lot more.nnIt's a short game but can be prolonged with a higher difficulty setting. Tougher enemies which makes crazy situations difficult, so don't forget to spend points and cash. The music is cool in SR3, With some classic tunes. The song POWER goes well with one of the missions in this title and is usually memorable when talking about SR3. Characters are also class, and occasionally funny.nnNow SR3 Is a classic but old issues haven't been fixed effecting a lot of players. The audio in some parts just comes & goes and purchasing some properties just closes the game. Meaning a verify integrity. Just a pain to be honest. For the nostalgia and fun to be had here i'm gonna recommend. Just not sure if you should get the original or Remaster as that's supposed to have problems. Just remember a newer version doesn't necessarily mean it's better.nn [u] ✅Pros [/u]nn✅Fun to play.n✅Decent Story.n✅Good Cast.n✅Some good Music.n✅Replay ability as new decisions to make.

In fact, my initial impression wasn't favourable as I wasn't used to such graphics and action point-based turn-based combat. It wasn't until the midgame that I really got into the game. Since then, Fallout 1 has remained my favourite isometric RPG. It might not be as good as Fallout 2 in terms of replayability, size and sandbox elements, but it's Fallout 1 that has this unique hopeless and desolate atmosphere of the post-apocalypse. The ambient music composed by Mark Morgan is by far the best video game soundtrack I've heard",Sun Nov 07 20:28:06 EET 2021,63234a44-8182-4429-87ab-4a3ad96f9505

As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.Community:The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages.

I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.Community:The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:1. Easter European Children,2. Normal People,3. Cheaters.CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.Gun Balance:Okay this one is good.Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!  Developer Support: After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies.",Sun Aug 22 04:22:57 EEST 2021,77a22b2c-a6ce-47a1-85d6-af6a55ed671b

Me included. I first played the original Half-Life 2 around 2005, completing Half-Life 1 shortly after. I remember how both Episode One and Episode Two were heavily anticipated and how I myself waited and eventually completed both of them. That was one hell of a journey and I will always remember it. But yet, this journey never got the proper ending for any of us... And yet, up to this day the Half-Life series remain to be legendary FPS games. Valve just nailed everything in them - graphics, music, sound-design, the story, characters and, of course, gameplay. Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 were so ahead of its time being so revolutionary. However, some can argue here that it cannot be applied said also about both episodes. But what's most important about both them, it is the fact that Valve perfected here everything they brought in Half-Life 2. And among both episodes it's Episode Two which actually the pinnacle of the series. And even that Half-Life 3 never came out and we can blame Valve for it as much as we want, it's still worth playing through the series and experience how good they actually are. Especially, this one. It has so amazing and intense combat-mechanics, a breathtaking story, an unic art-direction, as well as super-cool soundtrack. All this makes it one of the best games in the series. And yet, it remains to be one of most epic cliffhangers in videogames history... So, acknowledging all this controversy I still highly recommend you to play it and witness that final adventure of Gordon and Alyx. And with Half-Life Alyx released in 2020, who knows... Maybe the story of Half-Life will continue",Sun Aug 01 18:21:17 EEST 2021,2b174648-944d-47f5-ac6c-75e5072058d1

It annoys me that when I finally have the patiences to sit down and write a review about this game, that it had to be a negative one. I liked this game, loved it at some point, but it has evolved into a monsterious sh*t hole of a game. The updates are just getting rediculous. I have had, give or take, 1600 hours of competitive gameplay done and the ranking system is completely unreliable. I agree with most of the comments that say ""When you reach a certain rank, all you get are hackers."". I've read so many comments on how the community would like for VAC to be better and yet game developers are ignoring this call. Instead, they're making updates of which benefits them ""financially"". Like who in the world said that gloves would be a f*cking great asset to the game and that we needed more things to waste our money on. The game itself is cheap, yes, but the fact that the past updates has been about gaining money is beyond my comprehension. Please fix the game, thank you.Edit: I see now the game has gone Free To Play and implemented Battle Royale. What the hell is Valve thinking? The amount of hackers 10 updates ago were lots but still bareable (around 1 hacker per 15 matches) and now you've gone and opened the doors to them. I am glad I left the game before the previous free-to-play update was released. If any of you guys wanted this game and are happy about the FTP, trust me, you're going to regret getting this.",Sat Sep 19 17:44:23 EEST 2020,60de2443-6212-4931-aed3-23af5d65ea12

The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.",Mon Jan 03 15:51:00 EET 2022,130b2400-7dc5-4975-832e-5d95d1eb9166

I remember being mesmerised by promotional clips alone, brief moments of an elegant red colour darting across the harsh dunes. Ever since then I think back to that moment, not just thinking about the game but about how time has passed, about how times have changed so much so quickly yet the past still remains, if not in form but in memory. nnOpening up this game late at night around 12 AM, my room pitch black except my computer screen in which I find myself basking in its light. Everything else fades away, my room, the worries of the day, even the worries to come. All that remains is the stunning colours dancing across my screen, filling my view almost entirely as soft, carefully composed melodies comfort my tinnitus riddled ears, bringing me further into the magnificent world. nnOut of nowhere, a another figure joins me in our Journey. A friend? A foe? No merely a fellow traveller embarking on their own Journey, as we all do. I'd stopped to question whether it be an intelligent A.I. or another player, to me at the moment it didn't matter, we were there together and we had a Journey. And before I knew it, the game ended, the curtains drawn on a story, short but sweet, a light switched off awaiting to shine again. I think back to when I was younger, little old me, sitting on the couch not knowing the future, where I would be WHEN I would play that game shown on the television, now I treasure each moment a game is made as art because art will always be eternal no matter which part of our Journey we arrive at.nnI'm not one for sappy or even quote-on-quote ""poetic"" writing, let alone a video game review, but this game was merely a distant memory and having finally played it in full I can't help but write how I feel.

Too much drama has been poured into this game, that it is sickening. We have devolved to a state of madness which has eternally damned us in the name of CS:GO. First it was the ridiculous overwatch system, which in itself was not a bad idea. However, when looked at on paper, the abuse potential is amazingly high. Then it was Competative mode, the worst thing to ever happen to counterstrike. Then there was the skin gambling scandal. I would rather have cheaters and griefers in CS:GO than have riciculous overwatch bans and griefer bans.  The update on 10/25/2016 they took tooo far. CS:GO had always been a grey topic for me, but now I publically denounced CS:GO and anyone who is a dev, mod, or manager of it. You sold your souls to this? Are you happy players?

[17/20⭐, 10h🏅, 4/5💡]nnI’ve played Braid back when it came out, and to be honest, the game never really clicked with me back then. When revisiting it after all these years, and often seeing it lists of greatest games in the meantime, I was kind of hoping for a “how could I have been so blind"" moment. But it never came.nnNot that I have anything bad to point out. The main mechanic of the game is controlling how time flows. The puzzles are challenging enough, medium-hard, and each world introduces a different mechanic to time control that keeps the game fresh. But for some reason I didn’t feel the satisfaction I often feel in other games when finally solving a difficult puzzle. Probably because of some precision and timed puzzles, which are really not my cup of tea.nnThe story didn’t really do anything for me. I’m all for obscure and ambiguous plots, but here the story felt so disconnected from the actual gameplay that it felt forced. (There are several theories online, none particularly convincing.) The design and soundtrack are pleasing, but again nothing really memorable.nnPS: I absolutely hate speedrun achievements in puzzle platform games, if that's really what the developers are expecting players to master, I'm really not the target audience.

Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning.

That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.The real ranking system:Cheaters on topScammers in the middleLegit players at the bottomAt no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are.

A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!",Wed Aug 18 10:39:21 EEST 2021,70938015-608a-4936-900e-822a65713579

Valve has shown time and time again for the past 6 years that they could not give one single one about the community matters. Time and time again over this particular game's history, we see them not listen to the community. Honestly, this is the final straw. Nobody asked for Battle Royale, and you can be assured that nobody asked for a free-to-play game. or prime status to all.I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore. I thought getting out of gold was hard before, how about when you can't be sure if that new account really is cheating or not? I paid 15 dollars for this game, but now anybody can get it? Sure, free-to-plays cannot get prime unless they buy the game, but since when has that stopped cheaters? Who is gonna stop the 15 year old with his Christmas money and aimwar⁤e who just aquired a new prime copy of the game? You might aswell give prime to them already because they weren't being stopped.The game plays pretty alright for 64-tick servers, I guess. It's hard to say ""the game is good, community & company are garbage"" because the game isn't even that good. Battle Royale does not fit in this game because CS:GO's combat system isn't really designed for it. It feels like a rushed thing that they just wanted to do to attract more peoples' wallets.In short, the game doesn't really play as well as others, the company does not care at all, and it's just really not that fun.",Sat Dec 19 01:26:15 EET 2020,8297a082-295d-4bcb-8bba-ef6c09e2d71d

It's also the game that, at the time of writing this review, I have put the most hours into. It's so addicting, and if you find the right team to play with that communicates and strategizes, is an absolute blast and one of the best FPS games I have ever played.PositivesGreat graphics. The graphics on this game have aged well and look good. They're solid enough to not make you go blind.Built on the Source engine. I've always been a fan of the Source engine. It's very easy to run on any PC, has solid graphics, a deep options menu, which means the game is avaliable to tons of people.Great Gameplay. With smooth movement, unique spray patterns on all the guns, deep strategies gameplay wise and economically wise, ability to move silently, and more, CS:GO's gameplay is awesome. I like it a lot, and I find it very unique. The movement is smooth as well.Everyone is on an even playing field. The skills of a player only rely on their aim, reflexes, and expertise of the game, not XP like in CoD. For example, the other team can't automatically win just because they are all above level 50 and your team is a bunch of level 2s and 3s.Balanced maps. The maps of CS:GO are fine tuned, expertly crafted, and are all unique in their own ways. The defuse maps are constantly updated with tweaks to make them the best that they can be. Some maps receive complete makeovers, such as Train and Nuke, with Dust2 possibly recieving one very soon. The hostage and demolition maps are usually left in the dust as they're underplayed, but they're still solid maps.Operations. These are special events that Valve hold every couple months called Operations. For the price of $7, you can play two player co-op missions with a buddy and get case drops that you can turn around and sell for a dollar or two. Valve also release specially picked community-made maps that everyone can play for free.Community Servers. These servers host custom maps from the workshop. They also host custom gamemodes such as 1v1 and Surf.Skins. I find skins overall neat. While Valve can throw in some ugly and stupid skins, most of the skins are awesome, and are affordable. Some skins range from 3 pennies to thousands of dollars. The only skins I buy are ones that are under a dollar, with my rifle skins being a few dollars. There's likely no way in a million years I'm buying a thousand dollar skin.Gamemodes for both casual and hardcore gamers. While hardcore players will grind competitive defuse for hours a day, there's gamemodes for the casual player too, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, and a casual version of defuse that is easier than competitive defuse.Able to host your own server. While you can buy dedicated servers from various server hosters across the web, you can host your own server off your PC for free by downloading server files directly from Valve, and install custom plugins. I recently started to host my own server for me and a friend where I made it into a 1v1 server. While it's tough to set up, which happens with every server, it's awesome that you can do it for free.MixedToxic community. While there's teammates that are supportive and will communicate and strategize with you, there's also teammates that will insult and harass you if you aren't playing well. They will scream ""He's over there, dumba**! A MAIN!"" in your ear while you're trying to focus on the game. It's insanely annoying, and always gets you killed. Because you died, he'll start a vote to kick you. Screw those toxic POSs. There's teammates that have no idea what they're doing and will run and gun like it's CoD, along with having awful crosshair placement, so they'll be looking at walls when they die. There's teammates that will yell into their mic and act like they're funny. It's a community that's a dense minefield of good and bad, and one bad player can completely ruin your experience.Glove Skins. While I think skins are awesome, I think they're good enough on the guns. Valve have made glove skins, which I rarely see people use. It's just silly to make glove skins while people have been asking for 128 tick servers and a stricter anti-cheat for ages.NegativesVAC isn't the best. While Valve has been fighting cheaters with VAC and the recent creation of the Overwatch system, where specially picked CSGO players can review footage of reported players and judge if they're cheating, hackers are still thriving in CSGO. It's an infamous issue that has plagued the game for ages. While they aren't in every single match you play, they still exist, especially in the higher ranks of competitive.Gambing and Match Betting. Skins have caused negative things to happen that Valve weren't anticipating. People will gamble skins on coin flips and such, which leads into the skin gambling contraversy that exploded not too long ago, and people will bet on matches with skins. It's just sketchy stuff, and has generated some toxicitiy in the CSGO community.64 tick servers. I think 128 tick servers are needed, especially for a game as competitive as CSGO. With all the money Valve has made from CSGO, it's likely that they can update their servers to 128 tick so gameplay is smoother and server-side issues aren't as much of a problem.SummaryDespite all the toxicity associated with the game, CSGO is still a great game in my eyes. It's a unique FPS that I will happily play for many more hours to come so I can hone my skills and become a dominant player.I decided to archive my old review.

Completing their quests and getting hints about them will give you more XP if you will decide to consume them BUT, there is a big fat BUT as I like to say. If you want to complete the game for the best ending and get the Not even once achievement, then this will be pretty useless for you. As a good guy, you do not need to feed on citizens, meaning that you will not get many XP and you will have to suffer from the upper level of enemies and bosses. nnThe main story is a decent one but is not perfect. It does have some plotholes and some of the decisions that characters make are really under question. nnSide quests are just there and don't really matter if you want to be the good guy. They don't affect the main story but are just micro information about a certain NPC that you are completing the quest for.nnThe combat system is real garbage. Every fight feels like a real pain and with enemies magnet to you even when you evade them, will make you swear lots of times.nnGameplay is pretty simple. If you want to be the bad guy, complete quests, get all the NPC hits, and keep them healthy to get the most XP out of them. If you want to be the good guy, you can complete quests to get some XP, you can complete hints to get some XP and you will need to keep the citizens healthy to not throw any of the districts into chaos as that will prevent you from getting the good or best ending. nnThe most irritating will be going through the city many times. Back and forth, back and forth with the annoying enemies and some places where you can't go because it is closed. No fast travel and it will waste most of your time.nnAlso, I would like to point out the retarded decision on how you need to find NPC's. Using the vampire vision may help but it is so short distance that you can roam the same area 30 times and you may not find the NPC you need because OH MY, THEY WALK AROUND.

And i'm not talking about the gameplay itself, I'm talking about the people. The amount of hackers, greifers, major a**holes and toxic people is rediculous. Hacking is pointless and stupid and makes the game not fun for others. Just play the actual game. Besides hackers, there are people in competitive games who make you want to rage quit or shoot them by blocking your way to not let you out of spawn on PURPOSE, therefore getting a 30 minute-7 day ban. And then there are the ones who kick people for being a different race or being a weeb for no other reason. It's horrible. I can't belive there are people who would do such a thing like that. I can't believe this is what we've become. There are other things that i have problems with, like competitve skill groups, and the fact that i have met people who i became friends with, but were actually just pretending the entire time, or all of a suddon hate me for who i am. But i think i've said enough. I would give this game 0/10, but because of all the good times i had with people, all the experiences i had in the 300 hours i played this game, i'm giving it 5/10.

I love Valve. I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it.",Tue May 18 05:32:08 EEST 2021,77a22b2c-a6ce-47a1-85d6-af6a55ed671b

Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.-GamemodesCasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily.Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):MeAmerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensAngry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseAnother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuesSomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vieOther team:Uber SmurfSomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiesSomeone in a partySomeone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a roundAnime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and ScoutUh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui-Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: AKs-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and ArmorCounter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy-Round Two: Some SMG-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and ArmorEco Round? Doesn't exist in low Silver xDSave? Doesn't really happenStrategy? ""B"", ""Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it.You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill.-Rank up SystemCS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.-SmurfingA ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.-VAC System/OverwatchYeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.-CommunityI've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstopUnmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!""Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/Cuties and Hotties (right here)Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the gamePeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of themGrill GamersPeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GOThere are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.-CS:GO Skins and CasesI've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.-Valve/Game DevelopersEh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.-Friendly Aspect to the game?Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.-Overall OpinionIt's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come. Dayum, that was a LONG review, its just that CS:GO has so much in it to cover. It's pretty good.",Wed Sep 15 06:21:08 EEST 2021,60571f30-f398-421d-b20f-302918cbc394

No quick drop, or hold sadly. Next there's the pieces themselves, no super rotation system and the pieces are chosen purely at random, I got 4 long pieces in a row and lost the game because of it. Furthermore, the ""combo counter"" isn't a combo counter, it just counts the amount of lines you've cleared. Personally I think it would be an ok game if they added a proper 7 bag piece randomizer, keyboard mapping options, and an option for holding and quick dropping. But as for right now?

Well, to begin with Counter Strike is a very unique FPS game.  i first played this game in spring 2013 on and off. i finally think i have enough experience to write a review. Unlike other fake games we shall not name (CoD, BF) this game requires some knowledge and skill to play. Pros:Counter Strike does not require a super beefy computer and can be played with a average set up and hardwareCounter Strike has a ""decent"" community and most players are friendly to the other players (i said ""decent"")Counter Strike is not a pay to win game, you are not required to pay money and keep playing, the Operation passes are to support the devs and help keep the game going.Counter Strike has a growing community and you should be able to find competitve matches quickly (depending on the maps you select)Counter Strike has Dust II, Dust II is the best map every created for Competitive level of gameplay.Counter Strike is not FTP, if Counter Strike was FTP the community would crumbleCons:Counter Strike has had problems with Smurfs in the past, the problem has been fixed a little bit, but there are still some smurf problems. Smurfs can ruin a entire game and i know some players who quit playing because of the SmurfsCounter Strike has some hacker and cheater problems, i have played many games where i have run into a cheater. Cheaters ruin the game and it is no fun to play with cheaters.(There are some players who will play without a mic, grief, or throw games, this mostly occurs at lower levels, however i have not run into many of these players)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are my thoughts on the game Counter Strike: Global OffensiveI would really suggest giving this game a try if you have not tried it before Thank you for taking your time and reading my review- Boingdom",Sat Apr 10 21:22:44 EEST 2021,1e13952e-a1c7-41b1-8936-58299b61a890

CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:Sorry about the rant but this update has been rather disappointing xD",Thu Aug 05 13:26:22 EEST 2021,2c28f72a-ac9e-4baf-b054-9360ab30d7bc

No, not really.nnMankind Divided's fatal flaw is its plot. Human Revolution introduced us to an interesting, very well-thought-out reimagining of the Deus Ex universe with its themes of transhumanism, the negative effects of technology on society, and the abuse of power. It was in every sense a good, modernized series reboot and made for a fun and engrossing prequel. Mankind Divided takes the foundational idea of Human Revolution--that human augmentation could create an even greater divide between the powerful and the poor--and flips it around into the most stupid metaphor for racism ever produced in a video game. The ""mechanical apartheid"" idea is such an awkward failure because the premise makes no sense; augmented people CHOSE to augment themselves. People of colour did not choose to be born racialized. The comparison of the oppression isn't even close, and again, make no sense. nnMankind Divided beats you over the head with this theme so frequently that even the most Call of Duty-esque run-and-gun playthrough will leave you feeling exhausted. Eliza Cassan's voice is *literally* everywhere and becomes an incredibly annoying earworm rather fast. It also seems nearly everyone in the world listens to the foul-mouthed conspiracy theory nut on the radio and never turns it off. The horribly rude and bigoted things Czech citizens say to you on the mean streets of 2029 Prague are so mean and weird and once again FREQUENT, it all just becomes white noise at a certain point. The game tries so hard to sell you on the flipping of the main narrative of its predecessor that it comes at the cost of the rest of the story, and the enjoyment of the game itself. Sure, there are some crumbs of conspiracies to uncover, some baddies to identify and stop maybe, tons of vents to crawl through and desk drawers to be raided and computers to hack, and then at the end you defeat one big cartoonishly ugly Eastern European bad guy, and that's it. The game abruptly ends.nnMankind Divided's story is so drawn out, low-impact, and nonsensical compared to previous titles you cannot help but feel disappointed. It would have been an infinitely better game if they simply decided to have the ""naturals"" be the oppressed global underclass and the rich, augmented elite be the origin of or proxy for the dark global control conspiracies. It also would've been great had it not been half a story.nnIn most other aspects, Mankind Divided is a good immersive sim RPG, and is worth playing. For the Deus Ex veteran, however, this is definitely a disappointment. I really hope there is eventually a re-reboot and its makers take everything learned from past titles and do much better",Tue Jul 27 15:38:44 EEST 2021,0d22f2ab-46d7-4a40-8433-4074fee76643

Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.Valve's GreedYour intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources.

What are you trying to prove with this?The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.EpilogueI can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from.This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated.Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.Here's a clip to summarize my experience in Counter-Strike: Global OffensiveBut tell me what you think. Am I overreacting? Or is what I say pretty spot on?Tell me your thoughts and opinions in the comments below.",Tue Dec 22 13:13:54 EET 2020,77a22b2c-a6ce-47a1-85d6-af6a55ed671b

I'm on a Win 7 Pro box with a 1080ti gpu and 32gb of RAM. It really should have the resources and operating system to be ""not toooo new"" and not too old. But I had to jump through many hoops to get the game to even run ""out of the box."" That's a few negative points right there.nnI don't mind the graphics. They're quite good for a game this age. Soundtrack is ok too (a wee tad repetitive). But the combat sucks, the saving of your game progress sucks worse, and the sheer soul crushing formulaic sameness of every assignment killed my soul deader than any of my marks.nnA defender of the game said in a huff, ""It's not an RPG, it's an assassination simulator."" But that doesn't work for me because Altair *sucks* as an assassin for at least the first 2-3 ""memory blocks"" of the game. I ""get"" that he's demoted to ""novice"" but from there it doesn't make sense. An assassin finds a good time and place to kill someone, but all the save-the-citizen sidequests are 4-on-1 blood baths,nnI mean, sure you can call it an assassination simulator if you want, but that should mean I am an . . . assassin . . . able to . . . kill folks . . . quietly, sneakily.nnAnd sure...you *can*. But the game mechanics are insane. One minute, I can ""blend walk"" (this game's bizarre version of not-exactly-stealth) my way to a target and stick a hidden blade into his ribs. He keels over dead and I calmly walk away, and the guards take a minute or two to even suspect me. Great. Next minute I ""blend walk"" to some other dude, and as soon as I lock on *him*, that blending falls to pieces for no good reason and he's on me with his three buddies like white on rice.nnWhat?nnOne minute I can take a 4-on-1 fight and the attacker AIs sort of queue up to fight me one or two at a time, making the fight cake. Next minute, all 4 are on me at once, and a fifth guard from somewhere up the road a ways joins in. Why is one fight easy and the other a death-brawl? One minute I can use my ""hidden blade"" to insta-kill at least one of these folks before I have to draw a sword, next minute I can't seem to block any hits, and I'm reduced to button mashing.nnNo thanks.nnIf you're a twitch-gamer looking to see if you can precisely hit that in-game timer to ring the AI's bell in such a way that you get that snazzy combo move or whatever, maybe this is the game for you.  Thing is...I'm reading in the discussions about how much trouble folks are having getting the game to work on PC with a controller, and that's apparently even more of a hassle than getting the game to launch without crashing....uh...nnI find I no longer have the patience for twitch-gaming on a pc/mouse combo. At least not with this game.nnEvery single save the citizen quest is *exactly* the same (except, apparently for the random chance that the 4 guys harassing the citizen are actually able to gang up on you).nnEvery eavesdrop situation is just about the same, with tiny bits of info.nnI can't figure out if the game PLOT is interesting because I can't get TO it because the game keeps CRASHING. And even when it doesn't crash, it has decided that rather than return me to the last flag I found, it should park me in the Assassin's Bureau in Damascus, because why not?nnAnd let's talk about the flags...20 to find in the starter city, one HUNDRED to find in the kingdom...however many others...and for what? I'm not even sure. I think they basically give you more hp before you snuff it? Nothing in the game so far has told me what they are for. I thought they were to have a few save points but that doesn't seem accurate. Other than ""they are our enemies,"" I also am not at all sure why I'm supposed to kill 60 Templars. Maybe the game would get around to telling me if I could be in Damascus for a half hour and not suffer another game crash.nnI feel like I'm being forced to repeat steps to a dance I don't really enjoy in order to be fed just a few pages of a book I wanted to read.nnAnd then...they punish you for exiting the game. First you press escape to pause (ok fine). Then you have to ""exit the animus"" (whatever), then you have to press escape to pause (again), then you can select quit game. THEN you have select your game profile (no really)...of the game you're trying to exit....THEN...you can click exit. And then the game exits...or freezes...or crashes.nnIf you want a game where you can really enjoy assassinating people stealthily, pick up a copy of any game in the Dishonored series, go stealth, and kill. all. the. things. Grab a crossbow and the right set of skills and pincushion folks from a distance in Skyrim. Whatever. But this? I can't recommend this.nnI might finish it someday, because I have a ""you bought it, now it's on your plate, you have to eat it or it goes to waste there are would-be-gamers starving in countries without Internet!"" mentality, but I dunno that there's enough of a masochistic streak in me for that much frustration, and I can't encourage such deviant behavior in others. ;)n",Wed Apr 07 19:38:15 EEST 2021,452aa57d-59a1-4e88-b9b9-a88b37ae4075

The rank system is a joke.Overwatch is a joke.VAC is a joke.There is no anti-cheat system for this game.It has a tired engine. (2004) Source engineIt's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone  other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people  hence people having so many accounts...I have 1 account and proud of it.I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux.You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed.For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !This game would be great........ There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.The Facts and nothing but the facts........!

First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka:Screenshot of the comment: http://imgur.com/a/i80j3Comment: 'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'My Response: 1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).  6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game.

I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more.However, I have to play this game:1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance, 2. There's something addicting about being british and joining a game and speaking with an accent,3. On the occasional games that teams are balanced and there's no cheaters, they have been known to be fun (I swear),4. Every other shooter is just boring cos of the huge player base on counter-strike,5.

I guess, its time for a very short review.Heads up to the community for making Counter Strike as one of the biggest e-sports titles again.But if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure. Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is.",Mon Nov 15 21:55:21 EET 2021,851fa084-272f-46c8-b86f-eecf77728c59

After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done.

How does one even rate his mother?In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.",Fri Feb 05 08:15:19 EET 2021,f7d94b1e-0c78-449e-a409-9998e106a84c

Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more.",Sun Jan 16 18:18:54 EET 2022,645c4ad3-b9ca-428c-aa34-295f4c6e4ebc

You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it.

You'll get abused over mic and text chat constantly until you ""git gud"", and then even when you do it will still continue.If you play competitve to try and get better and progress through the skill ranks there's a 90% chance you will get yelled at continuously if you are last alive, pointing out everything you do wrong in their eyes, even though they are already dead.This games community is absolutely terrible and while there are nice people that just want to have fun or help out new people, they are a dime a dozen.If you think you'll be fine with all this go right ahead and buy it, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling when you can play, and even moreso when you do those pro™ strats™.

I will admit I am a huge fan of Sam Witwer and his work in the star wars universe and this certainly felt like a leap for him but the personal touches he gave to Deacon made him a favorite mc of mine. The open-world is fairly sized but the landscapes are graphically outstanding and I really enjoyed exploring it all. nnAs for gameplay, while I enjoyed the overall gunplay and driving mechanics it did feel as if the difficulty was a little lacking if you weren't playing on survival mode. I began a playthrough on Hard 2 and while I died a few times in the beginning trying to get the hang of it, there was a point early on where after leveling just a bit and finding nero injectors to boost stats, it felt like there wasn't much challenge.

Although the graphics haven't aged extremely well (and still were not cutting-edge by 2004), the gameplay and its mechanics make the base for one of the best storytelling FPS adventures out there.nnUp to this day, i have never played a better time-weighted game, where you're not spending too much time in the same environment or the opposite. The idea to use havoc's physics engine as a weapon with the gravity gun was total genius and the visual storytelling of each level was spot-on: Seeing the effects of the combine invasion in the city areas and even more in the coastal and canal areas makes up for interesting nature-construction environments, and the rotten town of Ravenholm, once lived by workers, now infected by all sorts of headcrabs, creates one of the best horror scenarios of the whole FPS scene, with its dim lighting, almost entirely used to lead the player to its objectives and not to just brighten the play area.nnThe mix of polished content and uncut beta assets makes a developer-side analysis of the game much more interesting, no wonder why there's such a healthy and durable part of the community that, still today, after 18 years, takes so much care in rebuilding each piece together and finding out the history of scrapped features. Not to mention, the beta content used in Ravenholm only makes the game more eerie and unsettling, with low detailing that leaves the player to wonder or with unexpected and unidentifiable sounds coming from all parts.nnThe game features one of the most arcadey styles of combat, with a wide variety of weapons, the iconic crowbar, if you run out of ammo, and the innovative gravity gun if you simply want to wreck stuff and have fun. If that doesn't suit your fighting style, there's loads of mods that enhance or change entirely the way the game plays. MMod, for example, adds multiple polishings to the game, such as reworked particle and visual effects, ironsight features, new viewmodel animations, new weapons and a multitude of other toggleable changes. If you're going for something more sillier or simply different, sites like gamebanana are out there for you to explore.nnThis game signifies the debut of Valve into the Source engine, underlooked nowadays, but incredibly capable if worked with properly. Its spaghetti code only limits the performance, but the accessibility renders it a viable choice for entry-level developers, as it's been in the past for a huge multitude of games.nWith it came legendary official games like Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and the Portal series, as well as so called ""sourcemods"" like Garry's Mod, Insurgency and Fistful of Frags.nHundreds, if not thousands of other sourcemods have spawned as games with similar gameplay mechanics, using the game's features with different stories and campaigns.nIf the game already satisfies you as it is, but sounds repetitive and boring after 18 years, Synergy is on the steam market for free, to allow you to replay the game with your friends in Coop modes.nOverall, this game has shown how much a Graphics engine is able to become a meme and a shared workspace for multiple types of development",Sun Oct 31 22:01:53 EET 2021,b4606f73-ee38-42a2-82b3-4a8c081d519e

I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole.

The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge.

If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors...",Mon Jan 11 04:45:41 EET 2021,eef6a2bd-8a70-4c96-8f96-d7139d77434a

So when I started doing it, at the half of it, I ran out of place. Couldn't type anymore.So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad. FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :DBut don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) ",Wed Dec 30 13:30:31 EET 2020,3443f571-22a1-47c3-92dd-5a94e17efa52

It doesn't just tell you that you're in the middle ages and throw a few knights and damsels at you. It shows you, down to even the mundane aspects of medieval life like bathing, eating and local laws. If you walk around the town at night without a torch, you can get in trouble, because in an age before street lights thieves used the cover of darkness to great advantage.  There's also public troughs to wash up in, but if you want a proper wash you'll have to go to a bath house. You have to remember to eat, and food you carry will spoil over time.nnIt's the thousand major and minor details like this that make the world feel truly alive, and it's as much a story-driven RPG as it is a medieval life simulator. All in a very good way. The world-building that so many other open-world RPGs aspire to completely pales compared to this. nnAnd if some of it sounds tedious, amazingly it's not. Everything is purposeful - you wash in a trough before entering a shop because your appearance will affect how well you barter. It's not just mindless busy work or leveling, and almost never feels grindy as a result. nnThis is a game where your character gets better, sure, but more importantly YOU get better at being your character. You learn how to navigate, survive and eventually thrive. The game helps you out in various ways, but it all feels earned, never given.nnNow for the bad. First, it starts off hard (very hard) and gets easier as you progress. The sense of progression is top-notch but the early game will definitely be too brutal for some. The level of challenge is a blessing and curse, as it will force you to be creative. Nearly every challenge can be addressed with multiple approaches and don't require outright combat. nnCombat, as well, is a very mixed bag, and frankly has a lot of room for improvement. It goes from being confusing and absolutely brutal in the early game to trivial in the late game. Yet, as mentioned this is often not an action-first game. You have options like stealth, diplomacy and subterfuge. You'll learn (the hard way) that going in ""guns blazing"" is rarely a good idea. Even very far into the game. nnGenerally speaking, KCD has an unpolished, indie feel with a lot of soul. It somewhat reminds me of the first Witcher game in that regard, but like that game, you're also going to see some jank and rough edges. You're going to see NPCs occasionally clip or get stuck. Quests occasionally bug. None of it is game-breaking and I can forgive so much because what this game does right it does oh so right. I'd rather take this game, warts and all, than yet another pretty and polished but ultimately rote and soulless turd from most other major studios. nnEven the premise - an RPG that doesn't rely on ""magic"" or ""fantasy lands"" to draw you in was a risk by this studio, but one that proves it can be one. nnI've been playing games since the 1980s and this is one of my absolute favorites of all time. For the gamer that can overlook its faults and see its strengths, I can't recommend it more",Thu Jul 30 00:07:17 EEST 2020,f88bfb65-201c-484e-8c40-6daa6f237321

When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend.",Fri Dec 31 16:53:59 EET 2021,966b1047-95b1-4dcb-ac15-4720d181d1aa

Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game.

So why would they stop if it makes them money?I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs.Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right?Nopity Nope!

As a result it's lost that iconic fairy tale atmosphere of the series. But this game is just a product of its time, and most of us who were teens in 2000s really admired it. Also the overall dark tone was much closer to the actual Persian mythology. With all the modern take on the series, the prince himself changed his appearance on more bad boy style one. As a result, his portrayal also became more sexualized. The same can be said also about female characters (even it was already a thing in the previous game). And that's actually very cool. I am not sure if such game would even be released today LOL. So, this is just a perfect sequel and a true classics",Tue Jun 29 05:53:20 EEST 2021,745f514c-e8b7-4fb2-bf2a-ccc6ee72f709

(Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!Neutrals:(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.",Sun Apr 04 09:41:12 EEST 2021,c4e41db4-e7b4-4a8a-874a-64e20ebe451a

My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games.Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun.BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"".After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others.You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review.I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?!I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do.To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers.This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve!And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"".So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system.This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture.You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins.This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame.By the way:Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system.Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days....",Sun Jan 30 15:21:27 EET 2022,8124c0f8-bd1d-4f4f-9dd9-94ee19e9da83

They literally take the apple approach to performance issues with the game, instead of helping you optimize the game, they'll recommend going to a technician to help optimize the game and spend money there, coz the money YOU give to buy the game doesn't include tech support.Fifth, though this can be included in performance issue, but there's times when the game will straight up freeze upon seeing an enemy or wont register hits even if you empty the whole magzine on their faces.Only get the game if it is a gift or it's on sale, it doesn't worth the full price.Review update: Right after I wrote the review I got ""some"" hacks which would help me aim and wall. And played till I got VAC ban which is for 250hrs and going from SEM to LEM, being a waller myself, I can gaurantee upon that atleast 50% people have vision assist of some kind and atleast 30% have some kind of trigger/aim assist. I wanted to prove that anyone can hack easily in this game, even with free hacks, which I used and can play for longer periods of time undetected.

CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: Pistols desperately need balance. Netcode and servers are horrible.VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience.",Mon Nov 23 10:09:02 EET 2020,76486434-585f-4cd8-80a4-99869a54213e

Before I begin this review, I feel like I should mention that, even though the PC version is definitely the best version of the game, setting this game up to work correctly on modern PCs is a real drag. Physical copies of the game flat-out do not work at all if you run Windows Vista or later, and there's no patch or workaround to fix it. You have no choice but to buy and download the game from Steam, and even though the game runs super well, the game's audio files, aside from the sound effects, were completely broken, so you'll have to download a fanmade patch to get the music and voiceovers audible. I don't want to sound whiny, but you have to understand it's situations like this that make me hesitant to buy more titles on PC. If I buy a game, it should run correctly right out of the gate, I shouldn't have to spend three hours looking for fixes and downloading patches and .rar file extractors for the sake of one game, even if said game is better than the aforementioned PlayStation games.nnWith my little rant out of the way, Max Payne is to film noir what Metal Gear Solid is to war titles. Max Payne not only has a dry, brilliant sense of humor, with hilarious jokes and references to hard-boiled detective movies and media, but it's also, on its own, a great crime story. Unlike Metal Gear Solid, the plot isn't exactly unique: if anything, every single cliche and trope associated with police dramas is present and hammed up to oblivion, but that's kind of the point. This game is not a comedy, by any means, but it is completely aware the story its telling has been done over and over so many times, it just revels in its cliches.nnThat's not to say its cliches are ineffective in any stretch of the imagination. Similarly to Batman, Max Payne's main goal is looking for revenge against a drug smuggler who murdered his family. It's just in this case, instead of his parents, it's his wife and newborn daughter. The first thing we see in this game is the aftermath in shockingly raw detail. It's honestly incredibly discomforting, and the sounds of that horrible crime haunt the game in a number of later levels. Max Payne, while he is a fugitive cop with little in the way of morals, he's still an incredibly likable character. He not only has incredibly cool moves when he fires away at criminals, as well as a permanently smug facial expression, but watching his interactions with people and hearing his inner thoughts make him such a funny and likable guy through and through. He's kinda like Marvel's the Punisher, but with 100% self-awareness.nnThe graphics and sound design in this game are absolutely incredible and would've been impossible to emulate on a PlayStation. From what I hear, the PlayStation 2 could barely handle it. While the static photorealistic faces are impossible to take seriously, seeing New York in the middle of a blizzard with millions of snowflakes falling individually in the background looks amazing. Even little details, like the individual bullets that fall whenever Max or any of the thugs fire their weapons look amazing. The game's story is mostly told through graphic novel-style cutscenes, which look amazing. The voice acting is also fantastic, especially James McCaffrey's melancholy yet sarcastic portrayal of Max Payne. Hearing him say corny lines with a completely serious tone is what really sells a lot of the game's humor.nnThe gameplay is structured to feel like you're playing an action movie similar to The Matrix, and it succeeds in every level imaginable. The bullet time mechanic in particular is a pretty ingenious mechanic that I really wouldn't mind seeing in more games. When you press the left Shift key, time slows down for a temporary period, making it easier for Max to aim and fire at his foes. It also makes it easier to dodge incoming bullets. You have a wide selection of guns and weapons to choose from, and no matter how many characters are onscreen at once firing away, the framerate never hiccupped once, and I didn't notice any clipping or tearing.nnMax Payne is the best game I have reviewed so far, hands down. It features fantastic atmosphere, a unique spin on a cliched story, and easily the best voice acting I have heard in a game so far. I honestly cannot wait to check out the sequels. While I still absolutely adore The Fifth Element and Metal Gear Solid, this game just feels like a huge jump from those two in terms of having better aesthetics and a tremendously better balance between story and gameplay",Sun Mar 14 11:45:40 EET 2021,8c900cde-9fc0-415b-9db3-2f1c3cf65d27

The competitive aspect used to seem like a good thing, but people take this game way too seriously and will lash out at you if you do anything even slightly wrong, and then on the other hand there are people who don't take it seriously enough and join competitive games just to annoy the people who take it seriously. There is no balance to this, you will hardly ever find a good team that you enjoy playing with.Maps - There may seem like a decent selection of maps to choose from, but there are only a select few which actually get played, and those are the old maps which most people have played thousands of times so it may be hard to get into, you may even feel discouraged.Not P2W - This game isn't pay to win, there are only weapon/glove skins which are purely cosmetic or different knives which ultimately all do the same thing, there has been a lot of controversy in the past about this kind of system being available to kids, there are cases where children steal their parents credit card just to buy skins.Many of the recent updates over the past year or so have been garbage, with many maps being added which almost never get played after a week, along with glove skins and other items so that valve can make money. I feel like this game has been abandoned by the developers, and now they primarily use it as another way to make easy money, completely disregarding the loyal playerbase and professional players.Smurfs (an experienced player using a new account to face lower ranks) and hackers are a pretty big problem in this game, and despite valves many failed attempts at combating the issue almost nothing has changed. Valves anti-cheat is garbage, and if you do end up getting this game, I would reccomend either faceit or ESEA, because their anti-cheat is a lot better and you generally face better players than if you were to play regular competitive.Although this game used to be a lot of fun to play competitively with friends, I can not reccomend it in it's current state, in my eyes this game is dying and after putting just over 1000 hours into it, I am ready to never play it again.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)",Sat Sep 07 03:57:22 EEST 2019,f219a69f-a7e2-4ecc-9bc1-da5e49353e7b

If you ran to a massive horde with just a rifle and three magazines in total, of course you got overwhelmed. And as it should, actually aiming turns out to be rather beneficial. Single-tap in the head > decuple-tap in the body.nnOnly two things really caught my eye in the main game:nn[spoiler]1) People (or at least Deek, our main character) have absolutely zero social skills, which I found funny/weird. A [b]LOT[/b] of the stuff in the story couldn't gone in a completely different direction is just Deacon opened his mouth and/or told the truth. And equally many scenarios could've turned to exact opposite if people just shut their faces and opened their ears for 10 seconds. [spoiler]Get bent, rent-a-cop-Jim.[/spoiler]n2) Some of the stuff that wasn't said out loud. Like why exactly was Iron Mike against Deek going south to find his wife? Or what had been happening outside the game map? We were teased about East, South and West closer to the end of the game but not more than that. And what was Tucker doing with her work camp? Literally the first cutscene she was in she said: ""This job's gotta get done whether it takes all goddamn year."" Okay, cool, [i][b]please[/b] tell us what the job is too because at least I want to know.[/i][/spoiler]nnThe straight up worst part for me were still the stand-alone challenges tho, which felt more like a massive irritation rather than enjoying the game. Had I been in the table where the decision was made to add a DLC that added the challenges which gives ""patches"" (which give permanent stat boosts that carry over to the main game, BTW) to the player for completing said challenges, I would've taken those patches and tied them to the original storylines and achievements. I would've been much happier with getting a stat boost (with bosst amount related to currect game difficulty) after completing a storyline, which would've then carried over to New Game+. That way the players could've been kept invested in actually completing the game at least once, after which they could've gone after just the things they actually thought were useful in NG+.nnStill, what's done is done. Another fine example on how singleplayer games can be better than the cash-grabbing multiplayer games.nnnPS: I still find it weird that we saw exactly one car and one truck move by themselves. Sure the roads were all blocked up but I'd have done something about it in the two year time-skip. Or most likely tried and end up getting nommed up by Freakers.nPPS: Ragdolling yourself with a bike without dying also gives a damn good laugh",Mon Aug 09 02:24:28 EEST 2021,5aa69fe2-e39b-426c-beab-a1510ae597d3

How are you all giving this a recommend?nnI loved New Order, but this game is messy in design at all levels. There's no direction to the maps and I was backtracking for ten minutes on each level just to figure out where to go. Do I go down this ugly, gray hallway or that ugly gray hallway? Neither!

I got stuck after meeting the New York Resistance group and couldn't get past holding off the Nazis that broke in because I couldn't grab health or ammo in time. nnThe weapons don't auto-switch when you're out of ammo, which is fine but one of the weapons has an inexplicable delay in firing after pressing the fire button. So you can't tell if the game is working as designed or if you're being screwed over and by the time you figure it out, BJ is dead. Also, while dual wielding, if one gun runs out of ammo BJ won't automatically holster it, he just keeps aiming it like an idiot. There's a learning curve, but I'm on the third level, where the hell can I get better?nnWeapon switching is clunky and slow, the animations for reloading are confusing and also slow, not a single invulnerability frame during melee kills makes them worthless.

No need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving.

I play against LEM smurfs, Globals smurfs, even the good ol' Silver Elite Master smurfs who still manage to destroy everyone. I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts. Nothing I have said so far has been hyperbolized, this is actually how the game is now.Hackers not getting banned. Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry.

I've finished the game a couple of times, currently just roaming and trying to finish and collect all blueprints, trophies and flags. I bought Dying Light 2, but first just finishing everything that I can in the first game.nnSomething which I don't really see in the reviews that often are all the Easter Eggs found within the game. yes, the game takes about 40 odd hours to complete if you just follow the main quest, but there's honestly SO MUCH TO EXPLORE and find. I don't think many people are aware that besides the Main and side quests, the game is filled with alien spaceships/ abductions even, haunted houses, references to movies like Hulk and Harry Potter and references to other games, Left for Dead, Mario and Plants vs Zombies just to name three of them. And even if it's not an Easter Egg, the developers created amazing content showing the lives of the people affected by the zombie outbreak, from suicides to notes about eating cats, to shrines dedicated to people. I've never had so much fun exploring and finding random areas. nnThey continued making content for the game up until the release of Dying Light 2. Which, honestly, is amazing and shows their dedication. I've loved every event that Techland threw at us, including the DLC's (And the prices goes down a lot during sales.) I think the DLC, the Following, is an amazing add on, since you're also able to drive around in a buggy and hit some zombies! (I also love the bobble heads and sprays you can collect throughout the game to improve the buggy). nnThe only part that I haven't enjoyed as much was the speedruns, but that was only because I'm really bad at it and that sometimes I struggle with the grappling hook attaching to certain buildings. But that might just be my own stupidity. nnOverall, my favourite game, as I said.

[/h1]nnNot by any means a prequel to Old Blood, not to The Colosseus games but it's just another one of Captain Blazko's crazy adventures, filled with bulletstorms, chaos, tears, blood and depression. nnOnce again you're put into the Nazi-hating shoes of Captain Blazkowicz, who begins this adventure by assaulting a compound said to hold the Masterpiece behind the world's invasion by the Nazi forces; Commander Deathshead. Ironically, Blazkowicz loses the battle, Deathshead emmerges victorious and the whole world submits into becoming a Nazi colony. One of two of Blazko's best men-at-arms is experimented on by Deathshead and dies while Blazko himself gets shrapnel inside his head and he's hospitalized in an asylum, where he meets Anya, the love of his life. Together they must go on a perilous journey to save the world from Deathshead's insane control.nnThe very amazing thing about this game is that you get to choose who is dissected by Deathshead at the beginning of the game, which will allow for two timelines: One where Private Wyatt is alive and the other where Captain Fergus is... Each timeline is different than the other; Wyatt teaches you how to lockpick, which will allow you to find very peculiar armor upgrades while Fergus allows you to disable doors, which will allow you to locate health upgrades respectively. There are other differences to the two timelines (that's why I highly suggest you play the whole game twice); in Wyatt's timeline, you meet with J, a musician at headquarters with a story that will fill your heart with sadness. In Fergus' timeline, you will meet with Tekla, a mastermind who will learn by the end that life is not all a field of probabilities, and much like Blazko's friendship to her, some things will happen without reason and without warning. nnThat's about it for the story... or should I say the ""STORIES""! You also meet a wonderful cast of characters; like the very iconically malicious duo Frau Engel and her assistant Hans ""Bubi"" as well as some of my personally beloved characters, like Max, J and Caroline. All in all the game is quite immersive, with some moments that will fill your heart with terror as well as others that will release on you true fear.nnNow onto the chaos; gameplay-wise the game is amazingly well-handled. The graphics are top-tier and the weapon play is gorgeous (you can dual-wield snipers on this one lol). Not everything you come across is breakable, obviously, but using the torchgun is quite satisfying to open up secret areas. One thing that I found missing from The Old Blood was the beds that let you travel to 3D Wolfenstein Games Maps (you can only find the one at headquarters). Voice-acting is great and everything just merges-in harmoniously to provide for you the ultimate FPS shooter experience. There are also perks to unlock that will allow you to hold more ammunition and deal more damage with certain weapons.nnThe game is great as a Single-Player FPS; however, the modes from TOB make quite a scarce appearance as you'll have to find collectibles to unlock only a handful of them, which cuts playtime shorter. Still, the game is absolutely gorgeous and it's something any Gamer should buy! It's a 9.9/10 game with a solid story, solid character development and insanely malificient villains that will give Hitler a run for his money",Sun Nov 28 09:51:39 EET 2021,622bc6ce-ad15-4b80-9f2d-96492afbb8ff

I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates.

I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.",Thu Feb 10 00:00:22 EET 2022,4a683726-2a70-4e4e-b464-e45ffa1127e3

Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.Sound and voice acting 10/10Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the ""Terrorists Win"" and ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYET"" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!Game physics 8/10Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)Community 6/10Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH!

Whatever that bloody thing does IF is still works, but I wanted it anyway! Now I have the whole Bioshock collection on my Xbox360 where its archaically locked onto an obsolete platform and disc format, AND i have it on Steam, where I can play it ANYWHERE! Im literally in a 4 star hotel isolating and playing Bioshock on my laptop. I always have trouble with this laptop though when I use an external TV to game, the refresh rate is janky or something cos its fine on laptop screen but big TV flickers and stuff like it can't match the refresh rate, and im unsure how to safely manually override it...... Help would be nice and a like and Vote up or reward for my review would be nice.nnOk so back to the review.nIt is set in a post WW2 style boom time when the hope of humanity was still bright but only off the sweat of his brow, (Play Bioshock, you'll get the reference...) and hard work, lots of money, and one mad despot to rule it all or screw it up completely. This game has all the classic story plot features, The Hero, The Damsel in distress who is not in as much distress as you find yourself in, the old timey themed guns and ammunition and accessories. I think just as a sheer Story experience, Bioshock will be one ride and I am finally going to sit down and enjoy beginning to end, as I have never done it...(Hushed gasp) I know I know, I said I owned it on Xbox360. Well I do, but I own LOTS of other games that sort of got in the way, Gears of War, Skyrim, GTA5 and the list goes on. So cut me some slack. But Bioshock will be a worthy addition to my collection of experiences that I will save on my immortal Hard Drive in the cloud and will spend eternity replaying with all my other AWESOME titles....",Mon Mar 29 08:32:40 EEST 2021,eff5bd6e-ebbf-42c2-a8fa-7fadda7d441f

Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 10   Graphics & Optimisation 6   Additional Content 10   Value 10   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 10 Notes: I rate this game to be the best FPS game I have ever played!!!

Since launch, D2 has been packed with bugs and questionable development choices that make it a challenge to play even when there ISN'T a game breaking bug currently in the game. The universe of Destiny is slam packed with lore and (formerly) interesting and memorable characters, both of which Bungie loves to ignore, rewrite, undermine, or kill off to fit whatever sort of theme or mood they are currently trying to set in the game. The worst part of this is that even after killing off Cayde 6 years ago, they have yet to remove his voice lines from several activities which only serves as a stark reminder of how good the game could have been. The Forsaken DLC was the pinnacle of D2 and now with the upcoming launch of The Witch Queen DLC, they will be removing all previous content from previous DLC's from before the Beyond Light DLC while providing no incentive or reparations to those who have purchased those DLC's that are being removed. In other words, you will no longer be able to access or play that content that you purchased in any capacity. Bungie continues to take actions that leave the community baffled and upset and yet the long time players like myself just can't cut off the bad fruit. We keep coming back and Bungie in turn believes this means they have a ""loyal"" fan base. The truth of the matter is that most of us just see the potential in the universe and pray that one day Bungie will manage to make something amazing from it. In the mean time its quite a lot like watching a train wreck in slow motion; terrifying, sad, epic, costly, and we can't look away",Tue Nov 30 03:09:10 EET 2021,ce07195c-8e72-4a7b-a486-fd7a0558f64d

All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank. If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned. I give it a 8/10.",Thu May 27 10:20:41 EEST 2021,35e77cd9-2397-4ef9-8c97-25eff902d1e3

And trust me, the ones you lose with scores like 10:16 are the worst games, cause this game TRULY gets the best out of you.

Only worth buying if you want another rehash of the same formula and don't expect much.nnThe first and sadly, for me at least, only positive aspect of this game were the absolutely gorgeous graphics. It's quite impressive how much visual fidelity has improved in a mere five years, and the performance is good as well.nOtherwise though, I really didn't enjoy 'Shadow'. Aside from a few new climbing mechanics it's basically the same game as the last two, but they somehow managed to make everything feel worse.nFor one, not only is the story forgettable, which is to be expected, the narration (the overall way in which the story is conveyed), which was excellent in the first 'Tomb Raider', is complete garbage here. Like in many blockbuster movies, things happen more or less randomly all over the place without any coherence or emotional urgency and even though the scope is supposed to be grander, it never feels like there is much at stake without any personal investment from Lara, who is really just a tourist who happens to be nearby when the locals do things. The completely unnecessary side-quests added for padding are also insultingly nonsensical, such as when a guy from an isolated village in the middle of the jungle asks Lara to find an artifact the queen tasked him to acquire as proof of his worth, because he 'doesn't have the time'. This might be par for the course in MMOs, but at least a little better should be expected from a story-focused first-person game such as this, especially when between the many lengthy (often unskippable) cutscenes and annoyingly long animations for everything from sitting down at a fire to wiggling through a crevice during which you lose control of Lara, large portions of the game are non-gameplay.nCombat encounters have also been trimmed significantly, both overall and in terms of number of enemies, which leaves puzzles and traversal for the majority of what you actually do. While there are fewer, but much larger world areas, both mandatory as well as optional puzzles (crypts and tombs, which are much more hidden and out of the way now), are more numerous and notably larger than before.nnNow, the reason I didn't enjoy these activities in 'Shadow' may be considered questionable, since it is unfortunately related to the (still fantastic) graphical quality and environmental design, which makes gameplay conflict jarringly with appearance. Thanks to expansive vistas and excessive (but realistic) amounts of clutter everywhere, areas seem much less linear than they actually are. On the surface, this might sound nice, and could have been an improvement if it didn't actually reduce player freedom by preventing you from going anywhere you are not absolutely supposed to go. In the first 'Tomb Raider', the area borders were very obvious, which is admittedly clunky, but in exchange everything inside was traversible, whereas in 'Shadow' you can't even jump on the roofs of houses. Moreover, I found this made figuring out where you are allowed to go very frustrating, because a large portion of areas that really should be accessible actually aren't. You have to jump/grab/aim in/at the exact right place or it won't work and even then Lara is often moved in mid-air as if pulled by a magnet. This can go so far that you cannot even shoot an enemy from a position you are not supposed to be in for that encounter.nThink you can jump this knee-high fence? Nope. Walk on that log directly in front of you to cross the gap? Slip off and fall. Need to go around. Lower yourself to that clearly visible ledge? Nope, was just part of the scenery, not walkable terrain. Drop down to the bridge maybe three meters below? Instant death. Even though it will be safe to walk on later when you go there the 'right way'. Instead jump five meters backwards while hanging from a wall to an area that didn't look accessible. Similarly, puzzles have to be solved in the one intended way, even if there is an easier and more obvious solution that should plausibly work (barring glitches of course).nnIn conclusion, I simply didn't enjoy it and that's all that counts in the end",Fri Aug 06 06:37:06 EEST 2021,33fc9839-7e2d-411e-9f82-2cc8582bcef1

You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform. Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player.Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything.You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings.At it's core CS:GO is a solid competitive team FPS with a lot of gameplay depth, good map pool, active playerbase and lots to learn and room to improve yourself. There's just many little pitfalls. I think a lot of people will end up spending more time on this game than they initially expected. I don't know if I'd recommend it.

You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so goddamn much to you.And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJBNjy5Ahg8And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community.",Thu Sep 09 02:55:54 EEST 2021,f16b9fc4-40ac-489c-a983-ed83868148b1

The maps and cities especially are beautifully designed and full of life, and the AI of the citizens is a particular high point that made me feel like I was part of a living, breathing world.nnThe prologue and epilogue shine as particularly enjoyable, but the gameplay between the two quickly becomes tedious and repetitive. Guards ""discover"" Altaïr sometimes with no warning or identifiable cause, which makes some of the interrogation missions (especially the archer assassinations) particularly difficult and frustrating. Combat does not flow well, as enemies only attack Altaïr one at a time which leads me to breathe a sigh of tedious frustration when I see 25+ guys lining up to get a piece of him. Combat also becomes trivial after learning the counter move early in the game which gives me little to no incentive to use the stealth system - if I can just murder everybody easily, why would I try and be careful? nnThe collectibles are a fun touch, but there are far too many of them. I saw that I had to collect 100 flags in one area and went straight to find a guide.

( mostly if  they use only P90)They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun.AND STORY CONTINUES........I really recommend to find a friends and play together.SKINSIn game you can buy skins.

You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN.

After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your  K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches.

Why am I doing any of this?!"" all throughout the story.nI don't care about these new characters, none of them have given me a reason to, so why in the hell am I still here? - And except for two familiar ones, none of Geralt's contacts are involved in the story at all.nnI kept playing, thinking that it may just be the start and it'll get better, especially considering the incredibly well written main story, but that never happened - instead all I got was a quest full of torture, I literally only felt negative emotions all throughout, I've rarely seen something as terrible as this.nnAnd not only that, but the storyline also involves doing certain things that are out of place for Geralt's character - such as organized theft, getting involved in necromancy, etc. - immersion breaking to say the least.nnnTL;DR:nFrustratingly difficult on higher difficulty, boring story, almost no memorable characters and no reason to care about any of them eithe",Fri Dec 31 14:02:02 EET 2021,de3812a3-b1d3-45d2-82e1-c4a6b9eb8e45

From there you follow a bit of story before you get to open world section of the game.nnAre you a fan of loot? Then this game is for you, with so many designs for Snipers, Pistols, Shotguns, Sub Machine Guns and Melee Weapons (Katana's, Knives, Pipes, Unique etc). And then all the aforementioned come in different qualities, like Rare, Epic & Legendary/Iconic. You get to dictate what kind of character you want by customising your skills to specific weapons types, or even full blown stealth/hacker builds.nnThe world map is pretty damn big, being separated into Main Sections, which then have their own little Sub sections. Each section has their own Fixer, think of it like a middle man who gives you contracts/missions (a quest giver if you will). Some of these fixers even have their own side stories and can be romanced if  you are their flavor.nnThe game has a fast travel system with discover-able points scattered in every corner, which is a life saver later on in the game, and there are a lot of cars/bikes/trucks that you can buy as the game progresses. I think when I finished all of them the number was around 30, and then there's another 5-7 that you can get from quest decisions/rewards.nnLength wise, the game is definitely on the longer side with the main story in itself taking a while to complete. But I urge you not to skip side content as a lot of it interacts with other points, stuff you will miss out on if you just rush this game. And if you weren't aware, this game has multiple endings and some of them are only available if you completed certain quests. nnI did encounter a few crashes/glitches here and there, but that being said in my total playtime I maybe had 5 or 6 so it really isn't as bad as its made out to be. The worst glitch I encountered was being unable to save after I went into my phone whilst a quest log was being completed and losing an hours worth of progress.nnCan honestly recommend this game if you looking for an exceptional game, that has interesting characters, great world exploration, insane weapons and fantastic stories.n",Fri Dec 31 00:20:36 EET 2021,5cae874f-3a7c-408a-a6d7-ecd3c0a11180

The community is actually amazing and very helpful, I've run into very few toxic people like I usually would get in most other online games like WoW or Sea of Thieves or LOL that seem to go nuts as soon as I talk over voice chat. This might also be why it also has one of the largest lady player bases of any game I've played... or at least that feel comfortable letting people know they're women. I know most games I avoid letting it be known like the plague. People are very helpful to new players and while it's an MMO the world is split into servers of about 20 to 30 players, to keep that post-apocalyptic feel, that you can jump around from to join friends. PVP is also optional, and very few things mark you for PVP (like lock picking a players doors and stealing a players junk... which junk is very easy to come by so it's not such a bad crime), but many people in my Fallout friend circle will just PVP for fun whether they're good or not and I've never seen it escalate past light hearted goofing. I even got hit by a player laid trap once that involved repairing of a player store triggering a spike plate... and it was so ingenious that I couldn't get mad! Also when dying you literally only lose junk which, again, is really easy to come by.

The game that we all should love.The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever.

Just look up a few Youtube videos that recorded some arguments on CSGO):1) Mr. L33t, the egotistical, temperamental♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who blames everything on you or other teammates-People like Mr. L33t think they're good. They're ones who feel entitled to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because they think their skill will win the game anyway. Imagine the following scenario, okay? Here it goes: you're playing a match defending a bombsite on the Terrorist side. Mr. L33t is carefully watching the bombsite's right flank as a sniper. An enemy player suddenly appears, who also has a sniper rifle. Mr. L33t and the enemy player try to one shot each other. Since you don't want to peak the sniper and get killed insantly, you hang back at the bomb site and play it smart like your other teammates. Mr. L33t, on the other hand, wants to get that kill so bad that he ends up getting sloppy. Then Mr. L33t dies. Soon enough, you end up being the last living member of your team, and you're still hiding. Meanwhile, the enemy team also has only one member after all the fighting.Now, you know this guy has a sniper rifle, so you ain't going to peak. Of course, there's a problem. He can approach you from multiple sides. You have two choices to approach this situation:A: You can take a risk and look for him, and if you're lucky enough, kill him. However, the downside to this decision is that if you end up dying, Mr. L33t will say ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE CAMPED!B: You can continue hiding in the same spot and hope to ambush them. However, if the enemy player has a good guess that you're hiding in that spot, he will prefire the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and kill you. If you die, Mr. L33t will say something along the lines of ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE PEAKED AND LOOKED FOR HIM!"" Or he will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you for not prefiring, even though if you did, you would never have hit the enemy player and instead give away your exact position, so even though the enemy player had a guess of where you're hiding, now he knows for sure. So which choice is the right choice? None, because you never had a chance to kill him in the first place and would die regardless. Meanwhile, Mr. L33t will be busy telling the whole team to join his circle jerk of hate, because clearly you are a bad player for not being able to kill him.You could, of course, tell Mr. L33t that if he were such a good player, he would have killed him long before it even became a problem, but it's clearly not his fault because he's the most important snowflake on this team. And remember the last round he tried to clutch as the last player? Yeah, he didn't clutch that match either, and he did far worse than you at it, but he decided to ♥♥♥♥♥ at his teammates anyway for not giving him proper call outs, even though that's exactly what you did. What did this guy do? He didn't give you ANY call outs. You know what's worse than playing on a team with Mr. L33t? Playing a game with 2 or more Mr. L33ts. Let the vote kick commence, but it's not like having them kick you off the team will make any difference because they're going to lose the competitve game anyway.2) Mic Spamming Mikey, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound loops, songs, memes, and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS in a comp match who wonders why the team can't hear any callouts.You would think Mic Spamming Mikey is a troll, but unlike other mic spammers, Mikey is taking this game half-seriously, so he's putting in some effort to win, although it's not much, mind you...Basically Mikey thinks everyone enjoys the BS he ♥♥♥♥♥ out of his mic, because listening to his stupid songs that have lyrics like ""touch muh wang wang"" and ""I'm so fresh you can suck muh nuts"" are clearly more important than listening to callouts. Nobody's going to be able to hear call outs with loud volume like that. Then comes the moment where a teammate dies, then Mikey says ""OMFG HOW COULD YOU NOT HEAR THE CALLOUTS? VOTEKICK!"" It's even worse if Mikey turns out to have the same personality traits that Mr. L33t has.3) Jackass Jimmy, the idiot with no sense of awareness.Jackass Jimmy isn't a noob. He's been playing this for a while. However, he still plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so he has absolutely no excuse to be an idiot. Jackass Jimmy still doesn't know call outs, recoil patterns, the difference between camping and rushing, and a whole lot of other obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥that you need to know. Jackass Jimmy is the type of person to hear someone say ""They're rushing B! They 're rushing B!"" and still stay at bombsite A because he doesn't know how to read a map. He's the type of person to fire a gun full auto at point blank range and still not kill his intended target. He's the type of person to buy an auto sniper, only to miss every shot with it and give the enemy team a generous donation of an OP weapon after getting killed.Jackass Jimmy isn't even trying at this point.4) Trolling Tommy and Backup BillyTrolling Tommy likes to troll competitive games just to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. He'll do anything to get on your nerves, whether it's purposely playing like♥♥♥♥♥♥ getting in your face to keep you from using your gun, flashing your teammates, ""accidentally"" teamkilling you, spinning around in spawn, and a whole list of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Naturally, such behavior warrants a quick and hasty votekick, but not for Trolling Tommy. You see, Trolling Tommy always comes with another equally stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥called Backup Billy. Backup Billy also likes to troll the game, but he prefers to blend in with the crowd and act like he's not part of it. Backup Billy's job is to keep Tommy from getting votekicked, so he'll always vote no. He'll lie and tell you he voted yes, then blame it on someone else.5) Hacking Harley, the hacking piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from the enemy team who keeps you from winning.In most circumstances, hacker accusations are unfounded and usually are wrong. However, in cases where there clearly is a hacker in your competitive mach, Hacking Harley just loves to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with their aimbot, wall hacks, spinbot, whatever. Forget having their team votekick them. Those guys want a quick and easy win. Enjoy losing a competitive match that could have easily been won by you if everyone played fair and square.6) Mr. SaltyMr. Salty has a temper like Mr. L33t, but Mr. Salty doesn't brag about how good he is. Instead, he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over trivial things. He will team kill his teammates for accidentally shooting him, making the whole team lose the match. He'll get angry at you for trying to give him advice. Mr. Salty is the type of person who has been on a losing streak in the past couple of matches so anything will♥♥♥♥♥♥him off. P.S.Casual matches would also be more enjoyable if we didn't have the following idiots:1) Mic Spamming Mikey (he's a full blown troll here)2) Tryhard Johnson - this guy is just like Mr. L33t, except he's even ♥♥♥♥♥ier and treats casual like a competitive game. He won't give new players the chance to learn and will vote kick them on the spot if they make a mistake they can afford to make. You know, because it's casual, and people try to get practice out of it...",Sat Jul 31 14:47:14 EEST 2021,2688c8a3-82a6-49e2-817e-6a0de3879340

Danger zone plays and feels like an indie battle-royale,cs mechanics feel weird and out of place in a genre like that.Also most of the time youre using SMG's ,pistols and shotguns which,in my opinion,lowers skill ceiling drastically.On top of that - map becomes boring and repetitive after a few games because it looks like its made in 2007 with first stable source build valve released.Last operation was over a year ago and all this time youve been working on this?!?!?Why?WTF...Valve always values community feedback ,for example - overwatch,reddit,forums,workshop etc. , but this time nobody asked for this,if anything, people were sceptical.So why would you,in a right state of mind,start working on something so controversial and uncharacteristic to cs as a god damn BR...

While still very playable and enjoyable, the enemy AI tends to gang up on the player, leaving them very little room to maneuver and use the tools the game gives them.

Source use to be fun when you hop into a server and you may or may not find the random a$$hole, but most people where very accepting and use to actually have great conversations and great games...but now its full of intense competitiveness that just makes people upset if you don't do exactly what they tell you when they tell you, even if you do what they tell you they will figure out a way that its still somehow your fault and not theirs at all.I do like competitive, but people (and trolls) need to lighten up. I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game. Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community.UPDATE 05/10/2016:The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same. Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it.UPDATE 09/30/2016:I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people.UPDATE 11/12/2016:Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all. I'm going to ask for my money back because this is one of the worst community's to play with along with poor updates and consistently making non-broken maps more broken/""balanced"". I have been playing on and off for years now and it looks like I may stay off this game for forever because of this toxic, unsupportive cretins and terrible company/dev updates that (again) don't help with stupid updates that don't improve the game, just their wallets.UPDATE 03/07/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY):Yet again just wanted to kill time, go on for a few casual matches and (as a terrorist) CT's have nothing but awps, autos and negevs for 4 matches in a row!!! Not rounds, games...different matches...same people, same sides, same guns. Literally not worth playing anymore...literally I don't know why I bother anymore. Again, don't buy. You're better off buying ANYTHING ELSE but this terrible time waster. I know this review is long, but it's been a small reminder over the last 9 months of on and off play to just stay away, the only reason I keep coming back is just a time filler. Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games. I still personally don't recommend this game, but if you choose to buy it, have fun I guess :PUPDATE 09/07/17:Literally trash. Would though away if I could. All awpers in casual, no fun in competative...its a terrible game. Don't buy it.UPDATE 06/01/18:Full of A.D.H.D., nothing but office, dust 2 and some other over played ♥♥♥♥♥♥ map.",Sat Feb 08 00:21:30 EET 2020,82736a5c-f7eb-4a4d-a62a-4213e76c4d5c

Never got notified that they got banned as i got once when i had 50 hours. Now I lose every round because i have to carry or enemy is damn good, I dont get good teamates as I would love to, they are too bad for me or 2 strong so i cant get any kills. I hate when i join game and in first half 2 of my teamates leave game. Anything isnt better with Trust mode that was added... I dont get wtf new dust 2 map is, it looks like you just used some parts of Office ( T spawn? ), Inferno ( B site), and Italy + Canals. Tunnels look almost same as tunnels in Aztec, I have to say that my fps isnt that bad for me like for other players it is, I usually have about 45-60fps in dust 2 40-50fps ( And that isnt very bad because I learned how to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop. ) Other thing I have to say for Nuke that has 25-35fps which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and what the hell is minimap and bomb sound on Nuke. I am at B site in doors room ( idk its name but its nice to hide ), and I hear bomb like it is 2 meters from me. I told my teamate that bomb is on B and after about 20 seconds we realized that it is on A... but it was too late gg wp.♥♥♥♥♥♥mapAztec got removed from game and there is achievment that says "" Win 100 rounds on Aztec "". What fu*king idiot removed Aztec and Vertigo from game. Maps werent balanced, true, but that isnt reason to remove them from game. And I dont get it why you dont bring them back with message "" We added removed maps to game because community wanted it. "" And why would you like to remove maps from competitive and make players unhappy? So people have more time to buy skins? Or write long reviews like I am doing now? You are just ruining the game with new updates. And about skins, almost all csgo profit comes from skins because some rich Americans have to buy Dragon Lore ( no hate ). Just imagine war with painted guns, unrealistic. You made skin market with in game inspect from nice tactical FPS game. And knife in game costs 5 more times then real life knife, you are just making people an idiots.Today I playied vs spinboter on Cache, and best thing is that hacker had 1400 gours in game. Idk, maybe he got hack when he had 1200 or 1300 hours, but after 200 hours in game (I just guess) this guy is still playing and ruining other people's fun. After all stupid things and toxic enemies who say ""ez ez ez"" when they win competitive match, especially if they have less kills then worst guy in my team. Also I got kicked for being the best one in game with 32 kills and ofc I got derank... All at all, I hate it because it isnt good balanced. And BOTs arent listening, I dont care about your stupid new shootgun update, like anybody will use shootguns they are sh#t in csgo and cost too much, so could you make BOTs listen and not die in first 20 seconds of the match...but no, shootguns are the most important thing ...I playied Wingman cuz I was bored and I dont get its new ranking system, something changed... Firstly I won 2 games in a row and after that lost and BOOM! I deranked to gn4 from mg1. After that I lost one more time and deranked to gn3, wow!!! After that thingie I won 3 matches and got no rankup and after that lost 1 match and deranked to gn2... WHAT THE F#Ck ?!?!?!?!?!?! I guess this is one more of VALVE'S briliant updates where you cant rankup up in Wingman and can derank if you lose only one match, Im not joking. This is for real and I dont know what is going on, I got matched against silvers as mg1 and that is reason for sure... but those guys play better then some of my friends that are mg2 or mg elite in Wingman... I swear.... They have less then 100 hours and play awesome. Well that is why I deranked wow... I wasnt playing csgo about 1 month, cuz its absolute bulls#it in my opinion. And that is the reason why game gave me to play vs silvers, I guess... and now I have Gold Nova 2 instead of MG1 with win/lose=10 ^_^Also when griefers are in my team they kill me and other teamate and just leave with 30 minutes ban, they got 30 minutes ban and we lost our ranks. That is fu*king nice Valve, fu*king nice. And after griefers leave in 3rd round, later result is 14 - 4 (for enemy)  I abandoned the match and got 24 hour ban. Well yes... Again fu#king nice Valve.One more time I got trolls in team, I found a nice chance to kick 2 of them because other 2 got kicked after they killed me on the start of first 2 rounds. After I kicked 2 of them It was 5v1 and I surrendered. When I came to lobby it said I'm banned for 7 days ""you kicked to many players""?!?!?!?... fu#k you and your stupid game!!!PS: I'm silver elite now and I was silver elite master after 20 hours in game. Logic. I have the most kills every match but I lose because my teamates are disabled idiots. Well...

Although the graphics haven't aged extremely well (and still were not cutting-edge by 2004), the gameplay and its mechanics make the base for one of the best storytelling FPS adventures out there.nnUp to this day, i have never played a better time-weighted game, where you're not spending too much time in the same environment or the opposite. The idea to use havoc's physics engine as a weapon with the gravity gun was total genius and the visual storytelling of each level was spot-on: Seeing the effects of the combine invasion in the city areas and even more in the coastal and canal areas makes up for interesting nature-construction environments, and the rotten town of Ravenholm, once lived by workers, now infected by all sorts of headcrabs, creates one of the best horror scenarios of the whole FPS scene, with its dim lighting, almost entirely used to lead the player to its objectives and not to just brighten the play area.nnThe mix of polished content and uncut beta assets makes a developer-side analysis of the game much more interesting, no wonder why there's such a healthy and durable part of the community that, still today, after 18 years, takes so much care in rebuilding each piece together and finding out the history of scrapped features. Not to mention, the beta content used in Ravenholm only makes the game more eerie and unsettling, with low detailing that leaves the player to wonder or with unexpected and unidentifiable sounds coming from all parts.nnThe game features one of the most arcadey styles of combat, with a wide variety of weapons, the iconic crowbar, if you run out of ammo, and the innovative gravity gun if you simply want to wreck stuff and have fun. If that doesn't suit your fighting style, there's loads of mods that enhance or change entirely the way the game plays. MMod, for example, adds multiple polishings to the game, such as reworked particle and visual effects, ironsight features, new viewmodel animations, new weapons and a multitude of other toggleable changes. If you're going for something more sillier or simply different, sites like gamebanana are out there for you to explore.nnThis game signifies the debut of Valve into the Source engine, underlooked nowadays, but incredibly capable if worked with properly. Its spaghetti code only limits the performance, but the accessibility renders it a viable choice for entry-level developers, as it's been in the past for a huge multitude of games.nWith it came legendary official games like Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and the Portal series, as well as so called ""sourcemods"" like Garry's Mod, Insurgency and Fistful of Frags.nHundreds, if not thousands of other sourcemods have spawned as games with similar gameplay mechanics, using the game's features with different stories and campaigns.nIf the game already satisfies you as it is, but sounds repetitive and boring after 18 years, Synergy is on the steam market for free, to allow you to replay the game with your friends in Coop modes.nOverall, this game has shown how much a Graphics engine is able to become a meme and a shared workspace for multiple types of development",Wed Dec 15 09:23:15 EET 2021,b4606f73-ee38-42a2-82b3-4a8c081d519e

Especially if you're a poor russian sod, who bought this game because your friend recommended you to do so. You'll be kicked from the server, just because guys from other countries thought that your drunk vodka dances wasn't good enough. That always grinds my gears.The gameplay is repetitive and there's nothing to talk about. I'm sure you've played it and know what i mean.Since I haven't much played it lately, there seems to be new payable merch were implemented, like: gloves, something about premium-accounts and ect. If the game tries to show the conflict between SWAT and mujaheddins, let's first get rid of the colored guns and gloves, because on the real war you won't be using any skins to show off to your mates. Soldiers on the war don't usually do that♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they have an objective to destroy the enemy forces, not showing off. The whole concept of skins seems very odd and doesn't fit in a game about the war conflicts. Also, I like the phrase ""Shop for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Merchandise"" on the Steam store page.The summary.I can't belive I spent over 300 hours in this game. The addiction that you might get from this is worse than drug addiction. Just for god sake, don't buy it.

At times, I question why I I still play this god awful excuse of a game. The one great thing about this community was the ability to gamble your skins, and ecspecially csgolounge. Not only did valve attempt to fully cease operations on gambling sites, they also took down csgolounge, the biggest and most reliable betting site of them all (also a personal favorite of mine). On top of these horrific displays of costumer servive by valve, they also have a ranking system that is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow that i could litterally rank up faster in the actual U.S. military.

Gaben, also known as gay piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥fan boy obese nerd online legend real life loser-having♥♥♥♥♥Gaben has slowly destroyed this game, due to the constant uploads of new cases and operations, just so that fat bastard can get some more cash from twelve year olds around the world.

Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10.",Fri Jun 28 16:54:13 EEST 2019,fed1555c-13f8-41ef-b037-5eec6a8329c1

Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first. ",Sat Oct 16 12:13:37 EEST 2021,fa108ea7-09f3-407a-8a15-318c67e9826b

Additionally, the crawl to level 21 (i.e. a requirement to play prime account matchmaking, which slightly decreases cheating encounters) is grueling given that the number of cheaters in non-prime results in slowed leveling; competitive matchmaking consistently provides the highest XP reward, which is dependent on rounds won. Valve relies on a peer review system (i.e. Overwatch) to punish potential cheaters, which serves as a do-it-yourself solution that is supplemented with VAC (i.e. an ineffective anti-cheating solution). Cheaters are not deterred as an overwatch conviction commonly results in the individual obtaining an alternate account. Despite Valve’s profit margins being nourished by superfluous additions (stickers, temporary graffiti, skins, music kits, etc.) the game has been lacking substantial content in the form of Operations, which are accompanied by new maps. The previous operation occurred almost a year ago, which far exceeds the average time between the last six operations of five weeks. Also, the gaming community is vitriolic - there are countless incidents of bigotry, griefing, etc. – it's a Sisyphean struggle of always wanting to expect the best out of CS:GO before being unfailingly reminded of its shortcomings. After nearly 1000 hours, I was left exhausted and resigned myself to the rampant cheating - I piecemealed together my own cheat using articles from numerous public forums. Expectedly, this resulted in me being overwatch banned after countering a series of cheaters in competitive prime-matched games. This 'other side' does not provide any reprieve - even the slightest tinge of a perceived good play, whether assisted with cheats or not, provokes the veiled hackers. I give up on this game as Valve has long before me.tl;dr                                                         …………………./´¯/)                                                        ………………..,/¯../                                                        ………………./…./                                                        ………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸                                                        ………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\                                                        ……..(‘(…´…´…. ¯~/’…’)                                                        ………\……………..’…../                                                        ……….”…\………. _.·´                                                        …………\…………..(                                                        …………..\………….\… CS:GO Excessive number of cheaters primarily in matchmaking (i.e. indistinct or outright) Lack of substantial content (e.g. 1+ year to release an Operation); however, Valve will occasionally release minor fixes for the existing map pool whether aesthetic or technical Ineffective anti-cheating engine and DIY stopgap (i.e. Overwatch) Vitriolic community and ineffective counter-measures Placebo buttons (i.e. report text / voice abuse)   Low incidence of griefing convictions   Heroes of the Storm adopted an effective abuse system a few months after release – Introducing New Reporting Options and the Silence Penalty[us.battle.net] - why is CS:GO lagging behind?We view any system that generates revenue at the cost of consumer happiness as a broken system that we need to fix - Kyle Davis (Valve) - In-Game Economies in Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 Steam Dev Days 2014 A common occurrence in CS:GO [image.prntscr.com] ",Tue Aug 10 10:38:13 EEST 2021,828aeacf-c608-4a7f-bb6d-9233d2d64ea0

Cheating:There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!2. DDOS-ing:I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!3. Smurfing:Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!4. Patches:Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!6. Community:The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.Over all:Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!",Mon Oct 25 21:42:11 EEST 2021,2da67490-1b13-4c48-be1f-607aded3bbe2

It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working.I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible.

Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive",Sat Jul 03 00:06:17 EEST 2021,9df97ef6-d3ce-420b-b76d-0c77900fbabd

Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team.

If you're gonna read this just know this isn't written completely out of spite, it's just my way of rationalizing how such a decent game can cultivate one of the most horrifyingly sadistic and brutally toxic communities I have ever seen in my 18+ years of gaming.Well, here we go...If you value your time, self-esteem or general sanity, I advise you stay as far away from competitive as possible. Stop. Don't bother. Save yourself the heart condition and stick to casual. Or don't play at all, that would be the optimal choice. This game is a test of character, not just a test of skill, and I will tell you why.This game splits everyone into one of 3 categories of player, the one who is bad at playing but can learn and improve, the expert player who harrasses and belittles all others for not being good enough, and the trash players who votekicks and teamkills reguardless of target or skill. This, of course, is nothing new and is pretty common in all online multiplayer games. The harshness of this game, however startlingly eclipses all other communities I have ever seen, creating a sinkhole of reason and leaving everyone with pure hatred not only for the opposite team, but every single person on their own team.You see, like the snake that consumes it's tail, all players that stick with this game end up reaching the second archetype, who in turn become the harrassers after all the hostility they put up with. They go and become the average player in the game, maybe a youtuber, who baits others into trying the game and constantly filling the quota of targets to harrass and belittle. It's a self sustained cycle that has slowly ramped up since the game first came out in 2012, which I can attest as I have been here since the beginning (my hour count doesn't reflect this, so it doesn't relate).That's not to say this is a bad game, no no no. It's just that the entirety of the community is toxic and spiteful, with about 3/4 of them (a generous measurement I'm sure) that WILL sour the game for you. On the other hand if you somehow fit into this description, then by all means try your luck. I promise you your newly found anger management disorder will find a perfect home in your life.If you've made it this far you're either intrigued by what I've said thus far, or you are skipping to the end to see my point. Well either way here it is:If you really want to play this, whether it's for a friend or personal interest, stick to the casual and more open game modes, otherwise I guarantee that you will not like the outcome. Even if you do decide you like it, you will reach a point where you reassess what you've experienced, the community you've exp[osed yourself to, and eventually decide whether you want to put up with this anymore.

I remember being mesmerised by promotional clips alone, brief moments of an elegant red colour darting across the harsh dunes. Ever since then I think back to that moment, not just thinking about the game but about how time has passed, about how times have changed so much so quickly yet the past still remains, if not in form but in memory. nnOpening up this game late at night around 12 AM, my room pitch black except my computer screen in which I find myself basking in its light. Everything else fades away, my room, the worries of the day, even the worries to come. All that remains is the stunning colours dancing across my screen, filling my view almost entirely as soft, carefully composed melodies comfort my tinnitus riddled ears, bringing me further into the magnificent world. nnOut of nowhere, a another figure joins me in our Journey. A friend? A foe? No merely a fellow traveller embarking on their own Journey, as we all do. I'd stopped to question whether it be an intelligent A.I. or another player, to me at the moment it didn't matter, we were there together and we had a Journey. And before I knew it, the game ended, the curtains drawn on a story, short but sweet, a light switched off awaiting to shine again. I think back to when I was younger, little old me, sitting on the couch not knowing the future, where I would be WHEN I would play that game shown on the television, now I treasure each moment a game is made as art because art will always be eternal no matter which part of our Journey we arrive at.nnI'm not one for sappy or even quote-on-quote ""poetic"" writing, let alone a video game review, but this game was merely a distant memory and having finally played it in full I can't help but write how I feel.

It greatly improved upon the game in every aspect with refined gunplay, a higher budget to improve the story, acting, the classic comic book cutscenes, and more advanced AI. It still keeps all of the core elements that made Max Payne so good by creating a depressing Noire York that now has constant rain instead of the snow in the last game. The story is also much more complex than the original's plot furthering this by allowing you to take control of Mona Sax who is a more integral part of the plot. Also the attention to detail in this game was crazy for the time allowing you to interact with a wide array of objects around you and putting you in a much more destructible environment. Max Payne 2 still holds up very well today unlike Max Payne which needed a lot more work to patch it up and still had issues with getting stuck on geometry. Max Payne two isn't without issues though, having to be completely fixed to run (which you can solve by altering the files after looking up a video), tedious levels like the one with Vinnie Gognitti in the Captain Baseball Bat Boy costume and him getting stuck on geometry with the door  in his apartment. The game was difficult for me on normal but was far less challenging than the original Max Payne with the straight up broken bullet time allowing you to completely ignore the jump bullet time and run around while everyone else is in slo-mo. Apart from that relatively minor list of complaints this game is a worthy sequel that was as enjoyable if not more so than the original Max Payne",Thu Feb 10 06:21:38 EET 2022,b05c1e72-81f3-4a22-b71b-28005d3aa71c

I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.",Fri Aug 20 19:15:51 EEST 2021,0e400d87-91f3-40e6-a915-8166d0af5ae7

Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.

On the contrary, when we go through a place once again, our reaction is greatly appreciated. Because the feeling that it gives us that we have to go through a place “according to the story” once again is just the feeling of being trapped. Yeah, we're on an island, and we need to get the hell out of here alive. We are fighting both the island and the forces on the island, our team is scattered all over the island, some have been captured, some have lost their lives...

However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any enjoyment out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't touchy teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are vastly outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be impossible to do so if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire (which you will see a lot of), I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature almost every time. I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time and the veteran players aren't going to stick around forever, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.Another issue is that in the update cycle for this game, things often end up even more broken than repaired. As of right now there are some serious problems with frame rate drops and hit detection, which you probably imagine would take the highest priority on the developer to-do-list, but no. Skins, cases and all other forms of micro-transactions always take the highest priority. I appreciate that Valve is a business and that their goal is to make money, but nobody is going to stick around to play a broken game when they eventually get fed up of it like I and so many others have. We paid for this game and it is your duty to maintain it and make sure everything works like it's supposed to! On one final personal note, I really wish that there was some kind of option to disable skins in-game and maintain only the default models. They're bloody ugly and ruin the immersion, but this is only a personal gripe.The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community and poor maintenance.Update: As of January 2017, I decided to try playing this game again to see if things have gotten any better. I'm afraid not, it's still in poor condition, hit detection is even worse and the community is still as toxic as ever. But hey, at least the cash-cow is still flowing in the forms of ""Glove Cases"" now, right? Sigh...",Tue Jan 11 17:15:12 EET 2022,70938015-608a-4936-900e-822a65713579

Boy was that a mistake.nnI grew up loving the adventurer genre, my childhood saturated with Indiana Jones films and a shitton of similar animated stuff that i couldn't remember if you placed a gun to my head. Growing up enamored with Indy has he swung around chasing artifacts and near death experiences with God knows whatever the old man is chasing.nnBut Lara Croft? I didn't really see her as an adventurer. For me she was a sex symbol and something more of a James Bond type. I guess it was a product of my first exposure to Lara which was the Tomb Raider movie with Angelina Jolie. With my mother probably regretting having to expose my 9 year old eyes to Angelina Jolie's side boobs and bare ass.nnBut that was Lara for me, an action hero. So it did take a while for me to get into Tomb Raider 2013. Cause in my head, I had better spy action games to play.nnLittle did I know, there was a masterpiece hiding in my Steam Library. This is an amazing game, from the Level Design, to the Narrative and of course the Gameplay. Everything meshes very well, from the way the game progresses and introduces new gear to how the simple mundane act of leveling up shows Lara's growth as a freaking Jungle John Mcclane (I think that's just Rambo). This chick is badass, and I'm not saying that cause I fell inlove with her tight ass, beautiful thighs and well rendered cleavage (Cammilla Luddington did a great job here by the way). nThe game really ties into how the island they're stuck in, is forcing Lara to grow and evolve into the badass Tomb Raider we all grew up with. And she really does turn into that  Tomb Raider. But since it's a 2010s game, she is a ruthless brutal killer and all.nnI'd say more but I haven't really written much and am running out of juice. nnbuy game, game good, Lara cool, Lara pretty, Lara killsn",Mon Jan 31 14:49:22 EET 2022,eeae10b0-a79c-4ff8-a00a-9ab2331cddce

The lower end players the brand new players tend to buy game hoping to have fun and get trolled all the time.

So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open.

As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad. Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into? People getting CRAZY about chargeable SKINS that only aesthetically make a difference? You tell me.Anyways, enough of that crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ opinions are opinions, right?Controls are okay, graphics don't matter anyways, teamplay is strong, skill is required, what else to say? I think there are enough reviews about the actual game mechanics other than the critizised points listed above, so let me be your hero and skip that part. I haven't written reviews in a while, so let's end this one as it would fit into the CSGO Community.C yka ♥♥♥♥♥, I'll smoke mid, gg wp.",Tue May 04 20:37:30 EEST 2021,34ec5303-4a14-42b7-8605-4bb28c497369

I soon left CS GO to go back to other games I was playing at the time such as Dota 2 (another Valve game that has tons of hats) and H1Z1 (a game that has tons of hats because it wants to be like Valve).I recently came back to CS GO and have found a much deeper appreciation for it. While I did promise myself when I first got it that I wouldn't go crazy with buying skins, I recently did binge on getting a skin for every weapon. Most skins however were very cheap and I didn't dare attempt to go after a knife since I suck with sneaking up on people anyway.Now unto the actual review. Through practicing in Team Death Match, I've been learning how to use the weapons a lot more efficiently. I'm still nowhere near good but I do actually understand that tapping rather than spraying tends to result in a lot more people dying. When I'm more advanced at the game I'll begin to study how the spray patterns work in more detail so I'm not only tapping left click for all my shots but utilizing the spray more effectively as well.If you're playing the Casual game modes, I'd say it's fine to solo queue because it's quite laid back.For Competitive I tend to like to queue up with full lobby or with at least 1 other person. It makes it feel more fulfilling to either share in the victory or the defeat together.For anyone on the fence about this game or gave it up after not understanding why none of their bullets ever landed on their targets: This game might go on sale for $7.50 around Christmas time. For this price or even a price near that, it's a must have in my opinion. Don't spray at your targets when you're starting off. If you don't know spray patterns you'll just get destroyed and will barely be able to kill anyone. Always try to tap in an almost even rhythm if possible so your shots will be more accurate. Don't worry about winning or losing in the casual gamemodes(non-competitive). As far as I've realized so far, people may say things such as ""rekt"" or ""get owned"" but in the end your calibrated rank isn't being affected by these types of matches. Use new player friendly weapons when you're beginning such as the P90 when you're playing with friends that are more seasoned when they want to play actual games. When you are on your own or are doing death match rounds, use the trickier weapons such as the AK47 or AWP in situations where ultimately whatever happens people won't care about as much.I hope this was somewhat helpful. I'm still new but I have found a new love for this game. I'm pretty sure that once I start solo queuing in Competitive at some point that it'll be like Dota 2 where none of my team mates will speak English and things will be... interesting. Well with that said, I'm off to play some more CS GO!",Fri Oct 08 08:19:25 EEST 2021,1e4aa3d6-2ef8-4ca5-b5b2-12fd473045f0

If you're looking for a stunning visual experience and some spooky stories to be immersed in, this game is perfect for you.  However, if you're looking for puzzles, exploration or a satisfying resolution to the mystery, you may leave disappointed.nnPros:n- The game is beautiful to walk through.  There is a sensation of being physically within the experience as you move the mouse to move your character's hands, unlatching gates or opening windows and then climbing and crawling through the spaces.n- Each story is a work of art in its own right, with a different type of presentation for each one.  You participate in every story in a different way, adding novelty at each step.nnPro or con, depends on your preference:n- There is no exploration; the game is linear and you never have to wonder where to go next.  It's basically a visual novel where you're unlocking the story piece by piece.  I loved the linearity because it was easy to play and there were no choices to worry about.  Others will find the hand-holding boring.nnCons:n- Although it's set up as a mystery where we want to discover why all these family members keep dying, there's no resolution to that mystery.  This family is just darn unlucky.  The stories are each interesting in their own right, but ultimately seem to have no connection to each other besides unfortunate coincidence.  The first time I played the game, I was hooked by the mystery.  The second time, knowing that there was no real answer, I found it a lot less enjoyable.n- A small point compared with the rest, but it was very dark a lot of the time, to the point where, even with the screen on full brightness, I couldn't see what I was doing and could barely work out where to go.nnWhat Remains of Edith Finch is a brilliant experience in many ways, but it feels like a visual novel rather than a game, and the lack of a real conclusion lets it down.

Valve refuses to fix the problems that plague the game such as: -God awful anti-cheat (You get cheaters in almost every game at higher ranks.)-Terrible hit detection.-64 tick servers.-Terrible FPS with each update.-The report feature that does close to nothing.Valve doesn't care about anything but how many skins and gloves they can pump out for money.

The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.69/420",Thu Jun 10 01:36:02 EEST 2021,6271f93c-ba18-4408-aa2e-fef906f8dd9e

I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more.I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE!

[17/20⭐, 10h🏅, 4/5💡]nnI’ve played Braid back when it came out, and to be honest, the game never really clicked with me back then. When revisiting it after all these years, and often seeing it lists of greatest games in the meantime, I was kind of hoping for a “how could I have been so blind"" moment. But it never came.nnNot that I have anything bad to point out. The main mechanic of the game is controlling how time flows. The puzzles are challenging enough, medium-hard, and each world introduces a different mechanic to time control that keeps the game fresh. But for some reason I didn’t feel the satisfaction I often feel in other games when finally solving a difficult puzzle. Probably because of some precision and timed puzzles, which are really not my cup of tea.nnThe story didn’t really do anything for me. I’m all for obscure and ambiguous plots, but here the story felt so disconnected from the actual gameplay that it felt forced. (There are several theories online, none particularly convincing.) The design and soundtrack are pleasing, but again nothing really memorable.nnPS: I absolutely hate speedrun achievements in puzzle platform games, if that's really what the developers are expecting players to master, I'm really not the target audience.

The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the ""your mom"" 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people.

Oh did I mention they are just skins with no function? :DConclusion: *smacks forehead* Look... The game is JUST OKAY. IT IS NOT the ultimate online pc shooter, but learning to play CAN BE TONS OF FUN with your friends. Hmm, whats this? Catch a little confidence? No worries!! Keep playing and the awesome CSGO community will be right there to rip it all to shreds and shove it back in your face. Cheers!That's all.. You may catch a few laughs outta the sh*** I wrote in the past down below, but with this summary my review is now complete. Peace out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)-----Update 1------Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :DGood luck and (try to) have fun!----Update 2-----Thanks for all the responses everyone!The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :DI actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!",Thu Nov 26 10:32:58 EET 2020,63218d58-78f1-4e37-924c-b4214f2824fb

I was moved by the story of some NPC's and each ending is simply epic, especially if you understood the whole story of the game until the end. I started playing this game in the summer of 2021, in one of the worst phases of my life, sinking into my depression day after day, I didn't eat right and I just thought about getting home soon and going to sleep, so my best friend encouraged me to play Hollow Knight on call with him, each playing their own save and helping the other when one was stuck somewhere, and it's inexplicable how much this game did for me. I came home from work exhausted, and my moment of happiness was opening steam and playing the game until I needed to sleep. As the days went by I was able to eat better, I could handle the events that happened during the day, I even managed to go back to college, that's when I realized how much hollow knight did me good, it gave me strength to continue at a time that I had already given up on myself. Recently after 142 hours of gameplay (103 hours on main save) I finally completed the 63 achievements (some friends called me crazy), it was difficult and required a lot of dedication and practice, but I feel like I should do this in gratitude and respect for the game that possibly changed my life.

The victorian setting and subtle music do a great job of building atmosphere, the blood powers all sound really cool. The balance of feasting on london's citizens for xp, but risking plunging the city into chaos is a very cool concept that should make being a vampire (vampyr?) very enging.nnIt doesn't matter how cool the blood powers are, because combat sucks. You move like your underwater, and combined with a poorly implemented stamina system, combat feels sluggish and inaccurate. Even if you do prefer a more methodical combat system, there are plenty of glitches that add to the frustration. Sometimes blood abilities won't activate properly; they'll play their animation and go on cooldown, but have no effect. This is especially frustrating when it happens to your ultimate ability, which has a hefty 100 second cooldown. Sometimes grab attacks will still hit even if you have invincibility frames during dodging. nAlso, sometimes enemies become un-targetable and immune to your abilities; I'm unsure whether this is a glitch, or just poor game design. Probably a little of column A and a little of column B.nnDecisions matter . . . except they don't. Several hours into the game, nurse crane begins blackmailing someone. If you learn about her life and unlock clues about her backstory, you can use your mesmer powers to make her forget her blackmail material. This causes her to become a feral vampire, with no explanation. This is the worst non-sequitur I saw, but there are plenty of other less egregious but still frustrating disconnects between action and consequence.nnThe writing is akward and stilted. You ask people a series of questions, and they give robotic and boring responses. They all have a distinct lack of personality, all the characters arevery cardboard. There is a 'romance' in the game, that boils down to 'boy vampire and girl vampire therefore in love'. If you like games for the story, there's nothing for you here.nnFinal note, the load times are horrifying. I have a pretty powerful computer, and load times were regularly three minutes long. Every time you enter a new area, exit one, or die, you get to chill in the worlds slowest loading screen until you are completely un-invested in whatever quest you were pursuing.nnThis game is not worth your money; and if you already bought it or received it as a gift, then it isn't worth your time either",Fri May 14 01:32:17 EEST 2021,27fda8a0-9a59-4f0b-9b0c-04c91e41774c

You can read my old review below.Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once.",Tue Dec 28 20:03:52 EET 2021,ebaffea1-70cc-444d-980a-312b108a17bd

This game may have become...lost in the sands of time, but it is still one of of the best adventure games you can play. It is definitely showing its age but upon its release it changed the direction of the video game industry. It's smart design decisions, style, story, and mechanics can still be seen echoing around in the games that release even today. nn- It created a new form of ""platforming""n- Its gameplay mechanics and story fit hand in handn- Its storytelling is done in a unique and natural wayn- It isn't full of padding like most games released todayn- The story is a ""romance"" both in the traditional sense and our modern perception of the wordnnIt's age shows the most in the combat. While still very playable and enjoyable, the enemy AI tends to gang up on the player, leaving them very little room to maneuver and use the tools the game gives them. Also, the camera and the way the Prince soft locks onto targets leaves a lot to be desired. These issues were common and ""normal"" in games of its generation though. In fact, I'd argue they weren't originally viewed as problems at all. But today, with the advancements in combat mechanics seen over multiple generations of games, it is hard not to look back and judge this game a bit more harshly that it probably deserves. nnPoP: Sands of Time stands on its own with a beautiful beginning and ending. Although the sequels are good in their own right (and very different in tone), it is safe to say that this first entry can be played by itself or with them as a trilogy.nnSide note: I played this recently on Windows 11 and this game has never been updated for modern machines. There are some good guides to fix some common issues available here on Steam. The only issue I was unable to fix was some low dialogue audio during gameplay.

I will miss you terribly.Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game.After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did, while not recommending it to anyone at the same time.Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate.Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites.And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered.Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing: Either play always with others, or lose everything you worked for.Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive.It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement.To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories:Casuals: your usual, run-of-the-mill players that team up with a friend or two, or they even may go alone.Premades: Most CSGO players are going in as teams. But, if you are unlucky and bump to a 4 man premade team, you are screwed in most times. Your every mistake will be exploited and become a reason for your team to flame you hard, or even kick you. Very rarely premades will make you feel like an actual part of the team (and these players are worth adding to your friend list).Smurfs: I like to call them the best players the Bane of Global Offensive. Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost.Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost.Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right, smurf accountsIn other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period.Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible.SPOILER ALERT: never open cases, sell them insteadRATING:Gameplay: 8/10 (non-competitive) 3/10 (competitive)Presentation: 8/10Enjoyment (replacing story): 7/10 (non-competitive) 2/10(competitive)Unique Factor: Community: 3.5/10OVERALL: 6.6/10 (non-competitive) 4.1/10 (competitive)Someone get me a match and some alcohol.

[17/20⭐, 10h🏅, 4/5💡]nnI’ve played Braid back when it came out, and to be honest, the game never really clicked with me back then. When revisiting it after all these years, and often seeing it lists of greatest games in the meantime, I was kind of hoping for a “how could I have been so blind"" moment. But it never came.nnNot that I have anything bad to point out. The main mechanic of the game is controlling how time flows. The puzzles are challenging enough, medium-hard, and each world introduces a different mechanic to time control that keeps the game fresh. But for some reason I didn’t feel the satisfaction I often feel in other games when finally solving a difficult puzzle. Probably because of some precision and timed puzzles, which are really not my cup of tea.nnThe story didn’t really do anything for me. I’m all for obscure and ambiguous plots, but here the story felt so disconnected from the actual gameplay that it felt forced. (There are several theories online, none particularly convincing.) The design and soundtrack are pleasing, but again nothing really memorable.nnPS: I absolutely hate speedrun achievements in puzzle platform games, if that's really what the developers are expecting players to master, I'm really not the target audience. In retrospective, this might have affected my review",Wed Oct 27 04:34:36 EEST 2021,8f40a290-99b9-455c-bcca-12e2b528e8d1

Telling in advance - I made long way from hating csgo up to loving it. But anyway, to the point:For people, who don't know what counter strike is, and who never heard about this game before:Counter strike is unique semi-reallistic game, which is build around global opposition of different terrorist groups (somali pirates, phoenix connection, etc) and different law enforcement groups (SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, SWAT, FBI etc). Game features several rounds (from 16 up to 32, depends on a gamemode and server rules), where every player have only one life per round. As soon as round time ends, or one of the teams eliminated, round is finished. After every round players respawn and acquire a sum of money to buy a weapon and different gadgets (armor, flash and smoke grenades, etc). Game features several game modes:(classic) hostage rescue (maps with ct_prefix):Counter Terrorists must steal hostage (or any of the several hostages) from a place, secured by terrorists and bring this hostage to a safe zone. As soon as hostage is brought, or whole terrorist team eliminated, counter terrorists win. If time ends and counter terrorists did not bring hostage to a safe area, terrorists win. As soon as counter terrorist carries hostage, whone CT team gets extra 1:30 minute time to reach safe place.(classic) bomb defuse (maps with de_prefix):Terrorists must blow one of two bomb plants. Problem is, there's only one bomb per whole team. As soon as bomb carrying terrorist falls dead, another terrorist can pick the bomb and plant it at the bomb plant point. Counter terrorists can not destroy the bomb or bring it to another place, if it's fallen. As soon as bomb is planted, round time stops and to win, counter terrorists must defuse bomb. If bomb is blown, even though all terrorists are dead, terrorist team wins the round.gungame (Honestly, forgive me if I make mistake here, but it's one of the gametypes I barely played): The least teamplay addicted game type. You start with one of the weakest weapons and as soon as you kill anyone, you get new weapon. As soon as you come through all the weapons (including knife), you win the map. You instantly respawn after death. I remember there was also gungame gametype, where you had only one life, but gungame is not my cup of tea, so let's finish on this.deathmatch:Also one of the gametypes where you respawn right after death. But, unlike gungame, you choose weapon you want at the start of a new life. You should kill as many enemies, as you can. Thanks to respawn in random places of the map, fight itself reminds a messy war, where enemy can shoot you in the back (just because he respawned there) and so on. I don't normally play this gametype aswell, but if I remember right, this gametype was brought by community.Also, community made more gametypes, like zombiemod, bunnyhop (or whatever is it called) and deathrun, where you need to reach some point.Now, for people who played cs for a while. Main differences from cs 1.6 and css here are: partially new weapons, updated radio commands, updated hostage rescue mode, where you need to actually PICK UP only ONE hostage and bring him to the safe place. Weapons have changed physics, so you'll need to learn everything again. And, an old problem, which became more important duo to competative gamemode: CHEATERS! Can't say there are many cheaters, but when you meet them, whole fun is ruined. Same when you meet stupid people.As we reviewed the game (I tried to be as short as possible), I'll express my mind on it:Firstly, I hated this game. It seemed like you need to deliver like 10 hits to your enemy. It had (and it still has) changed radio commands (yes, I was one of those few people, who used radio commands), you couldn't (and still can't) choose your player model (only team, like in css beta), you had and (still have) some grenades, which, probably don't even exist (decoy and incendinary, the molotov analogue, btw molotov here bounces from the wall, wtf?), or at least I was unable to find any info about them. In hostage rescue mode, why would you need to save only ONE hostage? Why would cops leave another one behind? You couldn't place silencer on M4 and 'base ct pistol', or use flashlight and many more things which I couldn't remeber right now. With time, Valve fixed their gaps, and I came to some re-analysis of the situation:First of all let's all agree with the fact, that cs:go is, unlike css, a complete SEQUEL of an online game, so OF COURSE it should have some differences, like radio commands, weapon reballance and stuff More over, with time it turns out, you don't need to hit your enemy 10 times, it's just you moving, so THAT'S WHY you don't hit the enemy. The ballance itself is still the same: 1-6 shots, depends on what weapons do you use; Indeed, you can't use player model, but they made 5 different models for each side, so you'll have no more 3 twins, out of 5 people playing, which, actually, compensates your choice of the model. Some changes were made for the sake of ballance (talking of hostages and some weapons' accuracy) Grenades... Well, firstly, I can't say these grenades are something sci-fi like. I believe that even if they don't exist, humanity can create them, using our own technologies. Also, Valve made special inventory, where people choose skins for their weapons and after few updates they brought us some old weapons, so now, you can use old good m4a1 with silencer, just as you did in css and cs 1.6, among with USP and it's silencer and another new pistol for exchange. They also made different skins for all weapons, so you can buy any skin you like and have your weapon in unique military\funny color (though, imo, it's a bit annoying to see all colors of the rainbow on some players' weapons, just because they love colorful schemes). Talking about radio commands again, it's better using VOIP instead of them, so updating radio is not a big deal...And now, I'd say, the best part of cs:go - it's competative mode. Competative mode features only classic gamemodes. In competative mode you play 5vs5. The more wins you get, the higher your rank is, the higher your rank is, the harder opponents and better allies are met. Competative mode is where whole TACTICAL potential of a game is shown. There's no map with perfect spot, enemy can always attack from the side, so you need to coordinate with your allies to cover each other, or rush same place from different directions, to capture it, with no any losses. Here's where all weapons are needed: short range weapons are the best for ambushes behind the corner, long range weapons are the best for long distances and medium range weapons are somewhat between long and short range. Though medium range weapons are the most often used, I must admit. You can play in a party with your friends, but be ready, because game will give you more cooperated team. Of course, not everything is perfect - sometimes game gives you wrong ranks, or you meet always-raging-idiot, or, what is worse, cheater, who kills you through the wall, but all in all it's a good game. A good sequel of one of the best tactical games of the end of the 90ths. What else can I say? If you like tactical shooters and you somehow never heard of counter strike, or you are thinking of buying it or not, my advice is not to waste your time and buy this game. It's just the game you should 'understand'. Too bad that biggest part of our youth is used to judge every game comparing to call of duty and quite often misses really good tactical games.",Tue Jul 27 12:13:30 EEST 2021,4a683726-2a70-4e4e-b464-e45ffa1127e3

Continuous and spontaneous crashes and other issues (including your aim being locked and you are dropped to 20fps) ruin the competitive experience. The random crashes don't seem to be as common for PC users for whatever reason. Recent updates to the Matchmaking system have now caused lower-ranked players (Silver and Gold Nova) to be continually matched with players with considerably more skill and experience, known as ""Smurfs"" to the community. While these ranking tweaks had good intentions, especially for highly-ranked players (Global Elite, SMFC etc.), they just seemed to amplify the smurfing problem to  a much greater extent. Smurfing ruins the competitive scene, especially for beginners and lower ranked players who have not yet been able to grow and learn to the extent of the experienced 'Smurfs'. While some may acclaim that Smurfing allows players to improve, by playing against players of greater skill, when you lose a gun battle to a smurf, round after round, you're forced to sit and spectate while you wait for the next round to begin. If you are most interested in watching the game instead of being able to play it, watching Professional CSGO tournaments might be your speed. It makes it hard to improve at the game when you are pummeled by a Smurf game after game, day after day.Besides this all, the millions of daily players cannot be wrong. Gameplay is fluent and heavily based on cooperation with teammates. CSGO gives a motivation to improve, to climb the Matchmaking ranks and become the best player you can be. Even the weapon skins add  a huge element to the game that is purely about a virtual economy for aesthetic customisations in-game.CSGO is an immersive experience, and is a great game to play with friends - a game to learn together and grow together to top the ranks of Competitive Matchmaking. However, every game has its flaws. Crashes, gameplay issues and smurfing are amongst the most heinous (and I haven't even touched on the cheaters). Overall, 400 hours of regular playtime speaks for itself, but major issues need to be addressed so that the game becomes more enjoyable for everyone, becomes a more competitive experience and the community can grow together in appreciation of the game.",Sat Sep 05 09:33:21 EEST 2020,aeffa47d-8038-469f-b428-ef7df0153fef

Why am I doing any of this?!"" all throughout the story.nI don't care about these new characters, none of them have given me a reason to, so why in the hell am I still here? - And except for two familiar ones, none of Geralt's contacts are involved in the story at all.nnI kept playing, thinking that it may just be the start and it'll get better, especially considering the incredibly well written main story, but that never happened - instead all I got was a quest full of torture, I literally only felt negative emotions all throughout, I've rarely seen something as terrible as this.nnAnd not only that, but the storyline also involves doing certain things that are out of place for Geralt's character - such as organized theft, getting involved in necromancy, etc. - immersion breaking to say the least.nnnTL;DR:nFrustratingly difficult on higher difficulty, boring story, almost no memorable characters and no reason to care about any of them eithe",Fri Apr 10 04:11:08 EEST 2020,de3812a3-b1d3-45d2-82e1-c4a6b9eb8e45

While still very playable and enjoyable, the enemy AI tends to gang up on the player, leaving them very little room to maneuver and use the tools the game gives them. Also, the camera and the way the Prince soft locks onto targets leaves a lot to be desired. These issues were common and ""normal"" in games of its generation though. In fact, I'd argue they weren't originally viewed as problems at all. But today, with the advancements in combat mechanics seen over multiple generations of games, it is hard not to look back and judge this game a bit more harshly that it probably deserves. nnPoP: Sands of Time stands on its own with a beautiful beginning and ending. Although the sequels are good in their own right (and very different in tone), it is safe to say that this first entry can be played by itself or with them as a trilogy.nnSide note: I played this recently on Windows 11 and this game has never been updated for modern machines. There are some good guides to fix some common issues available here on Steam. The only issue I was unable to fix was some low dialogue audio during gameplay.

I have played shooters all my life, grew up with the PS2 and PS3, and never touched true CRPGs like the original FO games until 4 months ago. Everything that made FO1 great (despite it's imperfections) is here, but far more detailed, expansive, and humorous in a way that is so hilarious yet offensive that it is crazy to imagine they were even put in here. Seriously, there are parts in this game that feel like Lloyd Kaufman wrote it. Somehow, it is able to juggle the humor along with the serious elements. People act like 1 is the bleakest game, which tonally I'd say is true, but the stuff in 2 is arguably darker. Slavery everywhere, drug overdosing in most places, prostitution, child murder, etc. The amount of world building here is literally God tier. Corruption even in the most ""peaceful"" places. The ambiguity of morality. The music of 1 helping sustain this toxic atmosphere, while adding in my view some of the best tracks Mark Morgan ever graced us with. My God. This thing is an absolute monster. nnMy journey with Fallout started with New Vegas roughly a year ago, which is an awesome RPG that helped me become obsessed with the franchise. Instead of going after 3 and 4, I decided to try the classics. I had difficulty with the first game, not simply for its infancy in terms of old mechanics (which it would improve in the sequel), but it's rough pacing in the first segments of the game. Not the most detailed areas, despite the great characters, wonderful atmosphere, and truly epic story ending. I love how overtly dark it is compared to the rest of the series, and I feel that pure tone has never been caught since. It is truly the saddest Fallout game. Period. nnYou think NV had a bad development period? Fallout 2 was made in [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2#:~:text=According%20to%20co-founder%20of,to%20make%20the%20whole%20game"".] 9 months [/url].. I can't imagine how they were able to accomplish so much despite that clearly rushed time period. The improvements it makes from Fallout 1 are not just mechanics. It's not just that companions are better (AI still wacky, don't let Marcus use a minigun lmao, but there is more control) or how you can move NPCs now. Dialogue is significantly better. Choices are significantly better. The story is imo overall just amazing, as good as the original if not better for me. Never in my life would I think that playing a porn star would look so FUN in a game. The characters, despite my true love for the Master and Set, are just better. Sulik, Marcus, Myron (yes, Myron), Sargent Dornan, etc. etc. Freaking Frank Horrigan. The inverseness of this game story wise is a wonderful development off of Fallout 1. God I just love this game I cannot stand it. Don't even get me started on the cut content like the [url=https://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/rainbow-confederation-encounter.160524/] Rainbow Confederation [/url] or the freaking original [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Childkiller?file=Child_Killer.png] Child Killer Reputation [/url] artwork. It's amazing in how more mature this game is compared to later titles. nn[h1]Tips for New Players[/h1]nnIf anything, I'd recommend anyone who has the patience to try older titles and games to give this a shot. Part of me wonders if people should start with 2 and then go for 1, but I also feel my experience with 1 was invaluable to me being able to ""jump into"" 2 without much problems. There are a few tips I want to give to those wanting to play that helped me play the game: nn[b]1)[/b] Save often. I don't mean ""save every 10-15 minutes."" I mean have several saves, a quicksave, every time you are about to get into combat, when you are going through a building fighting people save every time combat ends, etc. Save save save. It will save you a lot of pain. nn[b]2)[/b] If you are new, just follow the big quest stuff that gives you hints. Talk to everyone, think about the context of FO1 lore, look and loot places. In the Klamneth? Loot around near where the rats are, particularly a broken car to the east in that area. Saved Vic? Look in his inventory, what's that he's got there? Know how to loot. Make sure, because it's not always clear, to look around the room *carefully.* I straight up missed holes in the ground because walls blocked them, or didn't realize in places like New Reno that some staircases (Mordino Family for example) also go downstairs. Etc etc. I could probably think of hundreds of more, but these are good enough I think. nn[b]3)[/b] Understand the city map system. When you go to a town, it gives you options of where to go within it. Sometimes you may park your Highwayman and think it got stolen (again >:]) but really you just parked it in a different spot in town. Some places you need to look at the whole city map in order to travel to that specific spot. Just be aware of that. When in doubt, exit the area. Also, make sure you explored the whole face of the sections of town you are in. Lowkey missed the Poseidon Powerplant in Gecko simply because I didn't move my view all the way to the right lol. nn[b]4)[/b] Bugs. Honestly, I think I've had more crashes with FO3 lol, but 2 as well as the 1 can crash. Bugs suck and the game only has a few annoying ones (randomly slows down for no reason for a bit, screen blackens and clears up as you move your cursor around, etc.), but ONE in particular is real bad. There is a game breaking bug if you aren't careful. It's not exactly clear what the bug is or where it comes from, but many people call it the ""Too Many Items"" bug. Essentially, at a certain point, whenever you go into Chinatown in San Francisco, the game will crash every time. This is one of the many reasons multiple saves is very important. I was able to be in Chinatown a lot, but supposedly the bug occurs when you put too many items in the trunk of your Highwayman (yeah, that car ALSO has a trunk. I found that out by accident after using it for 5 hours LOL). You can still access the Tanker, but the moment you there, or anywhere else in the city, you have to go through Chinatown to leave, which will result in a crash. It makes your next trip into SF a one way trip. nnIf you are curious about the bug, I played this game raw (no mods) and it seems like some like the Restoration Mod fixed it? It's not super clear tho. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/38410/discussions/0/1698293703771299385/] This person [/url] was able to figure it out on their own (read the comments too). Check out the [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/User:Porter21/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide#The_too_many_items_bug] fallout wiki [/url] for more info too. nn[b]5)[/b] Lastly, I'll say this because I think it's good for anyone who's new nn[h1] Closing Statement [/h1] nnBasically, it's an awesome game for the main story, fun and serious side quests, and characters. NV is really good, but I think that 2 is the true masterpiece of the series. It is the game the future franchise built itself off of, for better or worse. I have not played a lot of video games in my life, but I think I understand the love here. I love it to death too.

The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response.It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers.The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves.Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community.As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us.""DISCLAIMER: I made this as a joke review because I thought it be creative as hell. This is also to commemorate for the fallen of the Pearl Harbor attack planned by the Empire of Japan, I give credit to FDR for creating the original and thought provoking speech for Congress and the people of the United States. However, I still give this a negative review because I don't agree with valve's instincts of making a BR gamemode to attract a community of children to play this game and the Free to Play option.

Those few I knew that had played them were enamoured with the bleak, but also deeply comedic post-apocalyptic world filled with equal measures of dark prognostication on our future and dark humor about the folly of the human condition. Because of various circumstances I didn't get the opportunity to get into them at the time, and it wasn't until FO: New Vegas I finally got a chance to experience the hype for myself.nnFallout 2 (and its predecessor) is one of the few titles that lives up to the hype generated by its most loyal fanbase. The writing is brilliant, the game mechanics while drawn from tabletop RPGs, was also unique in many ways and took advantage of a format that allowed very deep storytelling as well as engaging gameplay.nnThat being said, Fallout 1 & 2 are not for the easily frustrated. I have seen the various iterations of the ""you are dead"" screen more times than I care to count, and I'm barely 10% into the main storyline. Fallout 2 pulls no punches, and periodically it will tell you there's a spot on your shirt only to kick you firmly in the junk and laugh uproariously as you fetch a deep sigh and load the save you wish hadn't been quite so many hours ago. Fallout 2 doesn't hold your hand and walk you through the apocalypse, it kicks, punches, eye gouges and generally brutalizes you at every turn until you start to learn circumspection and good planning.nnFallout 2 is a cruel and seductive mistress, for sure.nnFew games today could lay claim to the brilliant writing featured in Fallout 2. The dialogue is often darkly hilarious, and the quests often leave you scratching your head at how you should balance morality, self interest and a desire to just get to the next objective. It's a thoughtful game that requires you to accept the only way you'll learn is to see your in game avatar die ten thousand tragic deaths.nnThe combat is a tad unforgiving by current standards. Those who have only had the Bethesda experience in the Fallout universe may be shocked at the difficulty, as even with both difficulty settings turned to their lowest you'll probably end up taking a thousand dirt naps for every moment of triumph. You're going to earn every victory, provided you don't quit in despair the 100th time a pig rat manages to erase you from and uncaring world because the gods of random number generators were feeling a bit cheeky. You think X-Com suffers from ""fuck you syndrome""? Pfft. The battles in that series, both classic and remake, are positively forgiving by comparison. You'll find yourself reevaluating what ""narrow"" chances are when a 95% accuracy score inexplicably allows you to land 3 out of 10 attacks. This is not a game you can just muscle through, slaying everything willy-nilly and skipping over the verbose text boxes and long winded voiced characters. You need to pay attention, be as cautious as someone who is really stuck in a post apocalyptic shitstorm, and develop the patience of a great Buddhist master. nnAll the quirks aside, the rewards for persistence and patience are deep and varied, and while I find myself rage quitting with unsettling frequency I keep coming back to hammer away at the richly deep world in order to discover its many delightful secrets. That and I now have a deeply personal compulsion to get revenge on those goddamn Enclave soldiers that have reduced me to goo in dozens of different random encounters while crossing the vast desert",Thu Mar 26 17:31:35 EET 2020,5252aa81-537f-45e1-bb75-bba79c67536f

If you played that game, you can import your save data and the game will take some of the events that happened there and apply it. Example (first game spoilers) : [spoiler] I made Alistair king in the previous game, so he's the king in this one for me. [/spoiler] And I really liked that aspect of it even though you play as a different character in this game.nn[list]n[*] Plot: Interesting plot that you interact with and affect depending on your choices. It feels like everything I do changes the course of the game. It's a really immersive experience. There are various conflicts in this game that you need to resolve as the hero of the story. And the game is split into three arcs that have different focuses. The plot is really easy to follow along but has a lot of details. The amount of storytelling in this game is scattered all around for you to find. 4.5/5nn[*] Characters: Well written characters with unique personalities. Even the npcs feel real and not two dimensional. Your companions have well fitting backstories that you explore as you play,,, some of them are quite painful and invoke many thoughts and feelings. 5/5nn[*] Graphics: Better than the first game but still similar. They're not the prettiest but you get used to them. I really like some of the backgrounds with great architecture and color options. nn[*] Music: Well fitting for an rpg. Nothing you'll remember much of however. Sometimes it's just ambient sounds which I think is peaceful and nice. 3/5nn[*] Combat: Strategy like combat system where you can pause the game and order your companions what to do. Sometimes they straight up wont listen or move on to another enemy despite you having ordered them to go after a specific one. Gets kinda annoying but it's manageable. The tactics section is very throughout but I didn't have the patience to go through it. Some fights are ridiculously difficult and almost unbeatable unless you fight on easier difficulties which isn't very balanced. nn[*] Total: 4/5 Play this after origins. Or as a standalone game, that works too. n[/list]nnn",Fri Jul 23 12:13:42 EEST 2021,42e92dbd-2dbf-4e8e-a86c-b123e4eeb65a

The community has inevitably grown to something much more than it was originally intended to be. What do I mean by this? Well I'll point that out.1. The number of hackers/cheaters has only gotten bigger over the years and Valve isn't doing anything about it, unfortunately. Yes, the VAC system works, but there are some cheats out there that are undetectable, an example such as LMAO Box (which is also heavily in TF2). Valve doesn't care about their own community in terms of cheaters/hackers, but they can fix this, by improving the security of their ""reliable"" anti-cheat system. 2. The community is full of trolls and jerks. There will always be at least one or two trolls within a server trhat you currently play in. There always be someone screaming over the mic, cursing out other people, and overall being more or less of a big annoyance. There's nothing you can do about either, you can't mute the person within the game, you have to deal with it or you have to mute your sound or leave to go to another server, which defeats the whole purpose in getting a higher rank. You can also decide to have a poll to have the user kicked off, but this never works. They will always attempt to vote you off if you are caught voting the targeted user off. It's also really annoying when someone voted to reset the server match over 50 times because they died and everyone votes to reset the match. No one cares for other people's enjoyment, they only care about themselves. 3. The economy in this game is demanding. There will always be people asking for things, such as knives, weapon sking and stickers. The first time I heard trading was introduced in this game, I knew it was going to stir trouble. Like TF2, people trade for greed and wealth, not for playing the game for fun. Speaking of which, your always made fun of if you don't have a skin attached to a weapon, not everyone wants those things you know! CS:GO is turning into TF2, Overwatch and COD all at the same time. The community has only gotten worse over the years and Valve isn't doing anything to improve/fix this. I don't want to think of this as another TF2, but unfortunately, that is what it has become and it will likely always be that from now on, because Valve wants all their games to be similar in terms of their other multiplayer games.",Sun Nov 08 09:46:23 EET 2020,eef6a2bd-8a70-4c96-8f96-d7139d77434a

I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??",Tue Jan 11 18:00:41 EET 2022,3443f571-22a1-47c3-92dd-5a94e17efa52

It's late at night and the events of that day seem like they happened so long ago. Yet, I can't get them out of my head right now. Maybe it's just my nerves. Maybe it's the darkness outside. I don't really care, honestly, but I need to get this off my chest. Otherwise, I might not be able to sleep tonight. Damn these memories, I wish they would just go away.It was about eleven years ago when I was in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I was in the seventh grade and I was that kid who wore all black and listened to heavy metal in the back of the classroom. Yeah, I was a goth kid. It seems silly to think about now, but everyone had their own little click when they were in LAN parties, I suppose. The goth scene really appealed to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a kid. I was bullied a lot, even before I decided to wear all black and listen to heavy metal full blast on my walkman. The '♥♥♥♥ everyone else in the world' mantra really suited Counter-Strike: Global Offensive at the time. And, for three of my 'CSGO Buddies', it suited them as well. I guess that's why we got along so well.My CSGO Buddies, two of which I haven't heard from for several years now, were just like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They were goths too. Everyone back then had a clique, I suppose. They were mine. We would spend every waking moment together, both out and in of LAN parties. They were like my strange, outcast family. Well... at least they were. Times change. I still remember their faces clearly. There was Andy, a very tall, robust kid that was the oldest out of all of us. Kyle, my best CSGO Buddy, who was short and very thin. While his frame may have been small, he got into fights -a lot-. He had a fuse the size of a bacterium, and wasn't afraid to give someone he didn't like a black eye. Then there was Billy. Billy was bullied the hardest out of all of us. Braces, pimples, and thick-framed glasses made him the perfect target for bullying. Yet, we four didn't care about anyone else when we were hanging out together. The rest of the world didn't matter; only the next Slipknot album did.I'm rambling aren't I?Well, perhaps I should get to the meat of things then. Where this horrible memory comes from and why I never see those old CSGO Buddies anymore.My CSGO Buddies and I would always go to a park after LAN parties and on weekends to hangout. This park was massive and held a Counter-Strike diamond, a football field, and a soccer field for all of the little kids and their little league games. However, at the edge of this park, was a large wooded area. It was completely cut off from the rest of the park and community. That was where my CSGO Buddies and I would go to hang out. There, no one would see us or bother us. It was the perfect solitude for a couple of goth kids. The strangest thing about this little wooded area, however, was a large, out of place wall that seemed to edge to park. I found out later that the wall was meant to sepaCounter-Strike: Global Offensivee an old World War II factory from the park so that the kids wouldn't have to be reminded of the war, but to a couple of kids growing up in the early 2000's, it was an eerie landmark.The strangest part about the wall... aside from the terrible graffiti, was the seemingly out of place door right in the middle of the wall. The door was completely rusted over and had long lost its handle. The door was more or less part of the stone wall, at this point. I'm not really sure how it was able to stay standing after so many years of disrepair. It was definitely a testament to its forger.Now, I know that this must sound pretty cliché. Yet, I'm sure that whoever is reading this must be pretty curious as to what is behind that door. Well, as fate would have it, it turns out that four goth kids with nothing better to do on a Saturday afternoon were also extremely curious as to what was behind that door.That Saturday afternoon, at about four p.m. or so... after the little league Counter-Strike game, I met up with my three bozo CSGO Buddies right by the door, since it was where we usually met. The three had obvious mischievous smiles plastered all over their faces.""Oh, what are you guys planning on doing?"" I asked accusingly, but a smile also stretching over my lips as I looked the three over. Andy grinned devilishly as he picked up a steel Karambit Knife from the tall grass. My eyes widened and my smile widened.""We're opening that door, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I stole this Karambit Knife from my old man's work truck. He's got, like, three of them. He won't even know it's gone."" Andy said laughing a bit. I remember becoming extremely giddy, almost attaining five year old levels of excitement.""Well? What the hell are you waiting for?! Open the door!"" I shouted at him. The other two began encouraging him as well. With a smug look, he placed the Karambit Knife at the frame of the door and began pushing on it. Now, Andy was a big kid and the door was extremely worn down. It didn't take much effort for him to open the door. With a loud crack, the door flung open, and the four of us, dumbstruck, looked into what was behind the door.It was a staircase going down into an incredibly dark basement... or bunker... or something. We couldn't even see the bottom of the stairs because of how dark it was. For about five minutes, we just stared down the concrete stairs in awe. Kyle was the first one to break the silence.""Whoa..."" he spoke, ""It goes down awhile, doesn't it?""""Yeah,"" Billy said, swallowing a bit. ""W-We should go though. Someone must have heard us. We gotta go before they call the cops.""""Oh, don't be such a baby. We've gone this far, we gotta go down the stairs!"" Andy exclaimed. The three of us looked at Andy with worried looks. We may have been goth kids, but we were still kids.""I don't know, Andy. It's pretty dark, and we don't have a flashlight."" Billy said.""Pfft, alright wuss. Go on, Kyle, you go down the stairs.""""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why the ♥♥♥♥ Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? You're the one who opened the door! You go down the stairs!"" He spat angrily. Andy furrowed his brow.""Yeah, and without my Karambit Knife, that door would still be closed, wouldn't it? I already get a free pass on this. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you got here last, you gotta go down the stairs!"" he yelled at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. My eyes widened as my attention turned from the stairs to the three others.""What? Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Why? It wasn't even my idea to open the door! I'm not going down there!"" I said, worried.""Come on! Someone's gotta go down. Billy and Kyle are too big of cowards to do it. That leaves you.""""I'm NOT going down there.""""Oh? I can't make you?""""You can't force Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to do it.""""Oh really?""BAM!I felt the large, blunt force of a heavy hand against the back of my head as Andy sucker-punched Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Andy was bigger and, well, let's just say broader than all three of us put together. His punch nearly knocked Counter-Strike: Global Offensive out. In my daze, I remember hearing Kyle shout something as Andy placed his hands on my shoulder and shoved Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I didn't hit the ground like I thought I would. Instead, I just remember falling. Falling down and down into an unfathomable abyss of darkness. He pushed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive down the stairs, but being as light as I was, I never even hit a single concrete step. I just fell, and fell, and fell until I hit the bottom. I hit the concrete floor hard. The impact knocked the wind out of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but, surprisingly, I didn't break any bones or, well, die. The world span and I couldn't even get up, let alone speak.",Fri Dec 11 03:53:42 EET 2020,82b720f6-6246-4ce9-bfd5-ce441ebe1078

It's one of the absolute best looking games ever to be released; its huge, varied world is rendered in an impressive, almost photo-real way. It's filled to the brim with life, from birds circling in the sky overhead to fish swimming in the river beneath your feet to strangers stuck by the side of the road. The open-world is probably the most detailed and lived-in I've ever experienced. It feels markedly real. That's a good thing, too, considering the amount of time you'll spend traversing it. Riding to and from your main objectives will often take longer than the missions themselves. The lack of comprehensive fast travel means you'll be doing this long after you've seen every beautiful location the map has to offer. Thankfully, then, no two journeys are ever the same. The amount of ways you can interact with the people you meet out in the world is amazing, and the small encounters you directly control are incredibly satisfying to play. They're possibly the best aspects of the game. That's because the main missions, which can often feel restrictive when compared to the free-roaming stuff, are as often utterly thrilling as they are frustratingly slow. The piece has a deliberate pace which unfortunately means that it takes a while to truly get going. However, it very much adds to the overall experience. It's supposed to be long, ebbing and flowing as its seasons and circumstances change. Its extended epilogue does take the wind out of the sails of its ending, but it's arguably vital in achieving the effect the finale is meant to have. Regardless of its issues, the narrative is straight-up phenomenal.nnnhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2691819425nnnIt tells an at once personal and sweeping tale, crafting characters that seem so human you could swear they were real. Something that the piece does a phenomenal job with is the development of its side-characters. The people who don't get much play in the cut-scenes can be spoken to around camp, or even taken on small adventures, which is somehow enough for you to form almost as close a connection with them as you do with any other. When one of your companions inevitably dies, it's genuinely heartbreaking. That can be said of the overall thing, too. It's heartbreaking. Yet, it's also exciting, funny, hopeful, tragic, beautiful and, even, poignant. It strikes the perfect balance between sincere and satirical. It's generally more serious than its predecessor and, as such, it's more impactful. Most of the silliness is reserved for its entertaining side-missions, which suits them well. It's often genuinely affecting and it has a strong underlying theme that lives up to its title. The writing is just wonderful. It's consistently good across each and every character you meet. The morality system actually changes some small things about the story, too. For the best result, you should get all of your dastardly doings out of the way to begin with; the most fitting ending, thematically, is the 'high honour' one. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and varied, with satisfying shooting and surprisingly deep mini-games. The animation, which is superb, does sometimes get in the way, causing some slight chunkiness that can be cumbersome to begin with. However, this is easy to adjust to and it simply adds to the overall slower pace of the game. It's a measured affair, never as unrelentingly fast as some of its peers but nearly always more satisfying. In the end, this is an engaging, entertaining and affecting experience. It's a massive, thematically rich ride that stands out as one of the best games of all time.nnnhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2705192499nnrest in peace Arthur.nnnhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271403143",Sun Aug 01 04:52:29 EEST 2021,417c5d47-4fc7-450f-b834-96163e979e83

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review Counter-Strike is a series of multiplayer FPS games, where two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, battle for a specific mission. The game was initially a mod for Half-Life, Valve's first game, until the sequels of the game were created some time later.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the latest game of the series, and today it is the most-popular competitive FPS game ever played. The game is just basically the same as the first Counter-Strike games, but a ton of additions and improvements were done.  Graphics First, the graphics. This is probably the biggest improvement in the series, as the game now looks more pleasing to the eyes, it has smooth movements throughout the game, and there has been a lot of decal improvements. Compared to the earlier games, Global Offensive provides a better and player-friendly nature thanks of today's modern graphics.Of course all of these cannot be achieved if you don't have the requirements to play on a flawless gameplay, but it is believed that it can run even on entry-level PC's.  Gameplay Gameplay. As I have said before, Global Offensive is mostly the same as the earlier games, consisting of the two game modes Bomb Scenario, wherein Terrorists must plant a bomb to a bomb site in a map and the Counter-Terrorists must defend or defuse the bomb if planted, and Hostage Scenario, wherein Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages held by Terrorists.Though there are additionals game modes that can be played. These modes are the Arms Race, Demolition, and Deathmatch. (although I believe these modes can be played on the previous games through a mod)Global Offensive also made changes to the gun system, they have added more guns to the shop and made improvements to them.The sound is still the same as the previous ones, however, around this year they have made changes to the guns' sounds, But the sound from Global Offensive is a lot better and clear than the others. Community The community is what most Valve games' community have. There isn't really much to say here, although it's worth mentioning that the community on this game series is actually more friendly and cooperative than other Valve's games. And since this a competitive game, (I'd say highly competitive), a lot of players are pretty serious on playing since this involves a huge amount of cooperation with the team.Toxicity is somewhat not that visible to the game, so players who are really serious about competitive games are present. Miscellaneous Like DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2, Valve's other popular games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has also what they call the inventory system. Here you can get item drops such as gun skins, gun stickers, and cases where you can get the gun skins and stickers. These items can be used to customize your gun loadout, or sell them to the Steam Market, where you can get money from. (If you are lucky, there are rare items which have high price on the market listings where you can sell those rare items for $$$.) Final Notes Overall, this game is one of the best games out there, for a cheap price, and offers a lot of opportunities to choose how you want to play the game. You could try making yourself into the game and go for the rankings, play casually to pass time, or probably to troll just to relieve stress and have fun for yourself. There is a lot of space for you to improve in the game, but still, like most multiplayer game does, playing this game with friends give the best possible experience and gameplay for the game.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not a pay-to-win game, and if you wanted to spend money on this game, make sure you just make it worth the money you spend on the game.-----------Definitely get this game if you want to get started on competitive gaming, or if you're just looking for a game that is worth the time and money spending. In fact, the most annoying and irritating things that could occur in the game is actually the most hilarious and most fun to deal with.Counter-Strike is a really popular game, so why not just get the game, and shoot down other players and join the fun?",Wed Feb 09 17:12:14 EET 2022,82b720f6-6246-4ce9-bfd5-ce441ebe1078

Unlike some Open World games that feel empty, despite being jammed with stuff; the emptiness of the post apocalyptic setting feels as it should.

I love the setting of gloomy post-war London. I appreciate all the colorful characters and great writing. All the little stories and investigations. I love how the game rewards you for exploring and paying attention. I even like all the crafting and taking care of the fellow citizens.nnBut there are two interconnected problems and they are huge.nnFirst, the combat. It tries to be Dark Souls and fails. Souls games are not just about being hard; they must be [i]hard but fair[/i]. Vampyr isn't the latter. The fights are all full of badly telegraphed attacks, moves that leave you no time to react and also unavoidable damage. It would be fine, if the game either had reasonable balanced difficulty, or if it would let you to grind and level up to match you preferences. But neither is true. Which brings me to...nnI hate the game's morale system. Basically, either you'll become a psychopath murdering innocent friendly citizens, or you won't get much XP. I refused to kill non-hostile citizens; it just felt wrong and the game even discourages you to do so. The problem is that killing them is such a huge source of XP and there's no alternative. Playing a good goy means that you will be seriously underleveled in the second half of the game. Many boss fights will turn into a nightmare worse than Dark Souls, with bosses killing you with one or two hits while you will need 5 minutes to kill them. In chapters 5 and 6 even the common respawning mobs will outlevel you by 10 levels, turning every encounter in a mini-boss fight. At this point you are weaker than any enemy in the game - even the weakest human mobs can kill you with fewer hits than you need to kill them. Weren't vampires supposed to be powerful? You will be just weak and pathetic, even with weapons upgraded to the top level.nnI won't lie. I have finished the game only because I used a trainer in a few boss fights. And only because I wanted to see the ending, otherwise I was done with the game. The last few hours were just an endless stream of frustration. [i]Normal[/i] difficulty was impossible for me. That's just wrong and it ruined what would be a great game otherwise.nnBtw yeah, there's an easy difficulty setting.

My opinion, however, is that this game's competitive ranking system is total garbage. Now before you go on raging in the replies saying ""ERMAGURD GO BACK TO COD MAD CUZ BAD GET GUD LUL"" please read the following.This system is poorly designed because you constantly have to be paired with good teams in order to win games and thus rank up in your competitive rank. For the uneducated, the more games you win, the more likeley you are to rank up, but if you lose games, you lose your rank. When you are constantly being paired with people who don't have microphones or toxic squeakers who don't know what they're doing, you derank all the way to silver one. The non comeptitive rank literally means nothing and is just there to look nice, which in my opinion should determine which skill group you're in for competitve, but nope. The system Valve built requires you to get lucky and be paired with a decent team that can communicate easily and knows what they're doing, which won't happen unless the planets align during a full moon.So if you don't want to constantly grind competitive matches and face a toxic community filled with tryhards and squeakers, don't download this game.",Thu Jun 17 07:39:17 EEST 2021,fbed753b-834c-4ca3-b7fb-8754d8d7a37f

It's obvious that is not about the gameplay. CS:GO as any of the CS games has, one of the most addictive and challenging gameplay ever. Technically the game is perfect: good graphics, fast respond updates to bugs and problems. One of the best anti-cheat systems in the world. Yep, better than Blizzard's. (You may not agree with the sentence about the anti-cheats, but I will explain this down.) And, even the market for ""goods"" and DLCs is perfect. It's focused on the older and more experienced players. Lots of ""skins"" for the new players and new ""operations""(maps) for the older players. The more you play, the better this game becomes. Like I said, technically perfect on any aspect. The problem comes form the game community. You may agree with, that the most of the players in this game are 12 years old kids with urgent desire to sleep with your mother. And, after few hours with the game you will become a polyglot linguist, mostly in slavic phiology (Polish, Russian). But this aren't the main problem. The problem is in the COMPLETE tolerance, the COMPLETE ignorance and the COMPLETE lack of knowledge from the community, about the CHEATERS. This game possess one of the most complete anti-cheat systems. It covers every aspect of the game: VAC- automatic anti-cheat program, Overwatch system for precise observation. This two programs are in constant communication with the main game and the ""Matchmaking system""- so, all of the cheaters to end playing against each other and to get banned. But, ...BUT... This system relys on, the ""willingness"" of this community to use this system, to deal with the cheaters.

The 'minigame' the store description advertises fails to mention that It isnt actually a minigame, It's MANDATORY to progression, If you fail to achieve the score goal you lose a life. The Point of a minigame is to have it be like an optional objective or a game within a game, you dont HAVE to complete it, but it gives rewards if you do. The Minigame is Poorly designed, with flying chicken giving the same amount of bonus time as an APPLE (And chances are chasing after the turkey will cost you MORE time then it gives), And Respawning doesnt actually take 10 seconds off your timer, It takes 12-13 seconds because the minigame has delayed respawning (FOR SOME REASON.).n2. Stages with infinite Lives Enemies, Its clear This is kinda trying to be super smash brothers with its simplistic movelist (Nothing wrong with a small and easy to remember movelist may I add.), However Super Smash brothers story mode has never had infinite lives enemies, And it can make Treasure bashes annoying because the enemy can yolo you out of lives at no consequence to themselves. If we have limited continues and lives so should the enemies in story mode.n3. And Finally, the point I find is the MAIN reason I have to give this game a Not recommended Review, Is that the final boss is truly stacked against you. Not only can you deal it no damage but every attack it has Can Take gems from you. EVERY ATTACK, I am not kidding, even its bullet hells count as Gem grabbing, And there is actually NO WAY to take away gems from the enemy because the minions it spawns do not drop gems. And worst of all is the fact you have limited lives on this and the enemy gives NO BREAK so you can Lose by the Gem Taken Victory Condition or just get killed to death (And Believe me it's easy to get killed). I havent been able to get to 15 gems but I wouldnt be surprised if it has a phase 2 and 3. Oh and the cherry on top?

HOWEVER you soon realise after this, that when you die, monsters would despawn.nnDespawning monsters removed the tension, as you knew if you failed, you could casually complete the puzzles and progress, without any threat.nnAnother negative point, despite the puzzles being great and varied, is that sometimes the solution just IS NOT CLEAR. One puzzle/progression point with rocks sticks in my mind, proving this point. This lead me in some areas to repeatedly backtrack, trying things, until i resorted to guides. Some solutions too require actions that you were never told to do/had introduced, so unless you know this, prepare to get stuck too.nnI have to compare this to Frictional's earlier games, the Penumbra series. They hit the same tone and atmosphere, but don't have despawning enemies, have more varied enemies, interesting puzzles and I feel hit the heights that unfortunately this game misses.nnPros:nGreat SoundworknSpooky atmospherenLovely gothic area designnGreat ControlsnnCons:nNot enough area variationsnToo few monster typesnObscure puzzle solutionsnDespawning monstersnnSCORE: 7/10nA game that starts on a high, quickly fizzles out and ends with a whimper. The first few minutes are great, before the atmosphere dies.nI can recommend buying this on a sale, for those first few sections, but otherwise, play Penumbra",Fri Jul 30 16:52:30 EEST 2021,8a0aa248-3471-43f3-816d-b09f9bd7c584

Within 4 hours i reached Rank 3 Battleships, and level 7.I downloaded the game expecting it to be like most other Vehicle Combat games on the market right now, with health bars and just shoot where ur cursor is, and to an extent that's the case here. Now you could say War Thunder has spoiled me with it's Interiors and modular system, but to an tiny degree WoWs has it too with guns being knocked out and fires spreading. But it's not quite up to WT standerds of having each crew being able to be knocked out and shooting at direct points of armour to hit a small ammo rack or feul tank. Now it does Have Armour but not X-ray. Well It keeps me happy that the HP bars aren't too overused.But let's get real here, nowadays EVERYONE talks about Graphics or FPS. For me, BOTH were above average. I got arround 30-40 fps on the highest settings and it looked great ! But still not a solid 60 or 200 ... War Thunder has this issue too, so i will let this one slide.Although the game does hold your hand annoyingly in the first levels. When i started the game, i was fustrated because i couldn't even access the Tech Tree until i was level 2. I spent atleast 20 minutes looking in the game settings and their video tutorials for where the button to it might be hidden. And when i DID get the tech tree open, it's shallow AS ♥♥♥♥. There is like only 10 ships of 1 type per type FOR 3 TYPES or if your lucky and picked America or Japan you get Aircraft carries ......... Even though britain ruled the waves, they still don't have a flushed out tech tree.Now even though the i am from England, and the British Empire did have the largest navy in the tree i could atleast get the famout Hood right ? The biggest ship in the Navy ? Well the Japanese get the Yamato and the Yanks get the Iowa, BUT NO the Hood was made a premium ...

I purchased the collectors edition of the game and likely hundreds of dollars of silver. I eventually got bored of destiny 2, so I stopped playing.nnIn that time, the game was transferred to steam from battle net. This was my fault. I should of saw an email, or checked up with it, but at the same time, it is sad that my data is forever lost due to bungie deciding not to host the data of blizzard net accounts and instead dump them to the void. Again Ill say, this is my fault and not the reason for the negative review.nnAlthough I was quite upset realizing I had lost numerous limited time items, and collectors edition extras, I decided to push on and see the start of the game regardless.nnIt had completely changed, now resembling the start of destiny 1. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this leads me into the reason for this negative review.nnWhat is there for new players now? Not much. I open my inventory to find my starting armor at 1100 light level. Why is this? To balance my character to the games current content. When the next content drops, new players will likely start even higher.nnWhy is this a bad thing? In destiny 2, bungie has decided to REMOVE content which does not match the current level and story line of the latest DLC. Previous DLCs, even if purchased become no longer playable, and the content is all but erased from the game. There is no build up for new players. nn""With the release of the Beyond Light expansion in November 2020, Destiny 2's original base campaign (The Red War), as well as all of the content from Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and Forsaken's Annual Pass, were removed from the game and placed into the Destiny Content Vault and are no longer accessible"" nnAll of this content, vaulted just because it isn't on level. Yet your light level starts Pre set above what it originally was in this content. I think players should be able to experience all of it, and build their characters up to the level of the newest content, while following the story line which leads into it. nnnWith the final part of this review I will leave some sentiment towards destiny 1, in particular, replaying old content. Up until I stopped playing destiny 1, two of my favorite things to do with friends was Crota's End, and the Prison of elders. No reason for doing them really, the loot you would get would be under leveled and unusable outside of cosmetic in the tower.

The outcome of a quest may be entirely different depending on how long you took to take the very same decision.nnPeople argue a lot about the combat mechanics. I believe they stand in accord to the game's proposal, to be challenging and realistic. In this game you are not a superhero, you are no assassin from a legendary brotherhood nor the chosen one of any kind. You are a regular guy, in medieval Bohemia, who had never had any combat training and is now trying to hunt bandits and fight battles. It's meant to be challenging, but, I promise, once you've got the hang of it, the combat is very enjoyable.nnThere will be a chapter of the game where the story will put you through a completely different experience. For an entire chapter it will feel like a totally different game and that is really, really amazing. I'll say no more in order not to spoil.nnThe DLCs for the game are quite relevant, especially From the Ashes and A Woman's Lot. This last one gives you an idea of what is was like to be a PEASANT WOMAN in medieval times. It is, also, a whole new experience.nnThis game is amazing in so many levels.

The game manages to find an almost perfect balance between action sequences, puzzles, story, crafting, exploration and light RPG elements. Graphics, controls and the gritty atmosphere are top-notch. Along with modernizing the gameplay comes the inevitable move to an open world with all the usual collectibles and the addition of a multiplayer mode.

In an era where unfinished and buggy games for $60 are what you can expect, going back a few years and playing this gem from 2017 really was a treat. Hollow Knight just oozes quality from beginning to end and no matter what sort of gaming background you come from, it's immediately noticeable. I'm a FPS/RPG guy so this game was completely out of my wheelhouse, yet I still found myself with the ""Pure Completion"" achievement at the end and enjoyed the journey (mostly) the whole way through.nn[h1] The Good Stuff [/h1]n[b] Graphics [/b]nThis game really is gorgeous, and the screenshots alone help convey that. Each area is unique and extremely detailed, which makes discovering new places just pure eye candy. nn[b] Combat [/b]nSimple, precise combat. The complexity of combat lies in how you approach the vast cast of creatures in Hollow Knight. In a nutshell, you can use your sword (or Nail as it called) and a handful of spells to attack enemies. Your arsenal is extremely simple (which is a good thing) and allows you to focus on the enemies moves and patterns without getting all tangled up in actually attacking.nn[b] Bosses [/b]nI LOVE THE BOSSES IN THIS GAME. While there are a couple of stinkers, the overwhelming majority of ""big baddies"" are extremely fun to fight. Each boss is unique and pose a different challenge for you to conquer. The brilliant thing about this game is that boss fights are very short, high octane battles which end up being very satisfying to beat and never a chore to get up and try again if you fail. The way bosses are designed in this game is easily my favorite part of Hollow Knight hands down.nn[b] Abilites, Upgrades, and Exploration [/b]nTo keep this part spoiler-free, I'll keep it short. Each ability and upgrade to your base kit is awesome. Damage upgrades are immediately noticable and movement abilities you acquire allow for more freedom and new places to explore. Everything you acquire in this game has impact. Exploration and tackling new challenges are very rewarding.nn[b] DLC [/b]nThere are 4 free ""expansions"" to this game, which are baked into the base game. Just like the base game, these additions to the game are pure quality. My favorite, which you can probably guess from the above, is Godmaster. Take the best part of your game and make an entire zone dedicated to it. nn[h1] The One Not-So-Good Thing [/h1]n[b] The Map [/b]nOh my, in a game this big, where exploration is everything, I can't help but feel like the ball was dropped on something as simple as navigation. Each area has a map associated with it. You acquire these maps through a certain NPC which can be found after a fair amount of looking around. Until you have this map, the area you are in shows up as blank. And then when you finally find the NPC, he only gives you a small section of the area, the rest you have to fill out yourself by exploring. But here's the kicker, the map doesn't update where you've been in the area until you find a bench (save point). Benches are few are far between which means finding one is very frustrating. Expect to get lost and have no idea where you are going in the early game. This becomes less of an issue after you fill out these maps but still very frustrating nonetheless.nn[h1] Tl;dr [/h1]nAbsolutely phenomenal game, even for people like me who aren't too familiar with the Metroidvania genre. Few flaws, dwarfed by the overwhelming amount of quality. A steal for $15",Thu Oct 28 15:06:45 EEST 2021,44b166c7-f606-4a88-8772-8fa8a7f4cd13

Even though the arsenal is smaller than Half-Life 1, the Gravity Gun is the main star of the show, allowing you to pick up objects. nThis is used for both puzzles and combat, bridging the gap between Puzzle and FPS genres. Plus, yeah, the ragdoll physics makes that shit worth it - The idea of launching a filing cabinet into a full speed fast zombie and having it rocket back into a wall while I escort a garden gnome across the valley so I can put him in a rocket ship at the end of the game is what I fucking live for. nnEnemy AI is also amazing. Using Combine soldiers as an example, they will use tactics in order to outsmart the player: One may attempt outflank the player while another reloads, they will use grenades if you're hiding in cover or rush to your position if they hear that you're out of ammo and use ambient explosives against you. nhttps://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/AI_Learning:_CombineSoldiernnThe games also have great achievement design (yes I have 100%d all three of them), with them all being memorable without being too annoying yet challenging. I recommend playing through the games normally to appreciate the intricacies for your first playthrough, but if you want an extra challenge, it's highly recommended.nnIn conclusion, play this or be a loser.",Fri Dec 31 12:48:19 EET 2021,2b174648-944d-47f5-ac6c-75e5072058d1

This is a really good and solid start, unfortunately, that is where my good points end.nn          The story here comes to, pretty much, a complete halt. The characters feel like blocks of stone, mostly because your ""decisions"", don't really afect them at all. Only real thing you afect is wheter or not you choose a correct dialog option to uncover a ""clue"", learning more about the NPC and allowing you to gain more XP from killing them. nn          This is also there the game takes one step forward and two steps back. Do you remember how I just told you about gaining more XP from NPC kills? Well, the game actively tries to discourage you from doing even that. Yeah, you do gain a decent XP boost, however it will also make the area where the NPC lived or is connected with less sanitary, thus more dangerous. So, you move forward with XP, but also nowhere, because now there are more enemies and are more dangerouse. Therefore, it is pointless to find clues, as they will not give me any advantage, the way you find clues is also incredibely boring and repetetive, most of these quest follow the formula of ""Go to X location"" or even better ""Find X item and bring it back to me"" or dare I even say the legendary ""Go to X location and kill X enemy"", these quests have to be the peak of boring content.nn          So, you might say, that sounds pretty boring, but that's just the story and lore bits, surely the combat is decent, after all, the game has the notorious Souls-like combat, right? nn          I really hate when people mistake Souls-like combat and difficulty. This game is not playing like a souls game. Period. The weapons feel clunky (expecialy the two-handed ones, as the parry ability feels more like a gamble than something you can actively rely on and don't connect half the time), customisation is lackluster, abilities feel extremely unbalanced and some enemies just feel like damage sponges. Souls-like combat is supposed to be simple, yet reliable. Reserved, but well customisable to fit the players needs and playstyle. Vampyr combat feels...off. As if the slow-paced gameplay was the afterthougth. It is the main focus, but it just doesn't feel like it.nn          And the cherry on top are the bugs/glitches. I have had my fair share of fatal errors, quests bugging out (forcing me to completely restart my savefile), NPC not spawning, Enemies instantly respawning (though I'm not sure if that is a bug or a feature? Doesn't really feel like I make any progress if the enemies come back a minute or two later) and the ever-so-sweet parry mechanic. nn          If you really want a good vampire RPG, I recommend something like Vampire: The Masquerade or maybe even Bloodborne (this one actually did the atmosphere, story AND combat perfectly). I really can't recommend Vampyr, it is just way too taxing to play and not fun or enjoyable",Tue Dec 28 12:51:47 EET 2021,27fda8a0-9a59-4f0b-9b0c-04c91e41774c

Unfortunately all things have good and bad sides:Pros:- Amazing graphics for a supposedly ""arcade"" game(Seriously though, they are good even if it was a simulator)- Good audio- Huge playerbase(you usually get into a battle within 1:30 minutes)- Divisions and clans(Good to play with friends)- Huge variety of ships(200+ ships from 8+ nations. Also there are four(4) ship types: Aircraft carrier, Battleship, Cruiser   and Destroyer.)- It has its own fun and adrenalin filled moments.- Lots of third party mods for people who like that kind of stuff.- Very well optimised(It can run quite well on even a old computer)So far so good. But we still have the cons:- LOOOONG grind to tier X(like maybe 3-5 months per LINE of ships)- Matchmaking is a bit of a problem: Sometimes you don't even want to sail in a tier V ship unless you absolutely have to.   Trust me when you're fighting a tier VII ship in a tier V it's hard.- Some people can be salty: Some people might get upset when they get destroyed or if matchmaking does not favour   them. Even i'm salty sometimes when i get one-shotted by someone.- Premium ships: These are ships you have to pay to get. They are usually stronger than the normal mainline variant of the   ship. These are expensive(around 3500 inr for a tier VIII premium battleship).- Premium account: Like premium ships, there is a premium account status that you can pay to get. This gives you   increased credit and XP income. It's a little bit more fairly priced but it's still expensive.Overall, its a great game. Definitely a game i would recommend.

Why am I doing any of this?!"" all throughout the story.nI don't care about these new characters, none of them have given me a reason to, so why in the hell am I still here? - And except for two familiar ones, none of Geralt's contacts are involved in the story at all.nnI kept playing, thinking that it may just be the start and it'll get better, especially considering the incredibly well written main story, but that never happened - instead all I got was a quest full of torture, I literally only felt negative emotions all throughout, I've rarely seen something as terrible as this.nnAnd not only that, but the storyline also involves doing certain things that are out of place for Geralt's character - such as organized theft, getting involved in necromancy, etc. - immersion breaking to say the least.nnnTL;DR:nFrustratingly difficult on higher difficulty, boring story, almost no memorable characters and no reason to care about any of them eithe",Tue Nov 03 17:54:20 EET 2020,de3812a3-b1d3-45d2-82e1-c4a6b9eb8e45

Well lets put it this way its a completely different game than it was before and I feel personally its not better its worse. The UI is competely trash on the main screen. The keybinds are not the same as before and the keybinds are horrible I couldnt play with how they are on default and yes I know you can change them but still the controls are confusing and just plain out bad. The match making isnt great at all as its awsome to get placed with tier 4 ships at tier 1 which is kinda of ruins the whole pvp system. The only thing I liked was the PVE that now if it doesnt fill up with players under 30 seconds it places bots which is nice.This isnt a bad game it was just a better game before they reworked everything and changed things around again my option is some of those changes werent great. Basically if you never played this game before you might like it and you wont notice or care about some of the big issuses I have with it now but to anyone who has played this game when it was in beta might not like the things they did.,Thu Aug 20 07:16:14 EEST 2020,2f99bbc3-4667-42df-9cf0-1472a445310e

Its not a bad game but it gets very stale very quick. I have tier 10, few premium ships etc but I cannot give it a positive review as every game is identical. Torps are spammed from ships ranging from destroyers to battleships. Battleships sit back lobbing shells at max range for this reason which again gets boring quickly. If like me your an aggressive player, this isnt rewarded on this game as your secondary batteries are rendered completely obsolete by torpedos. A typical game is, Destroyers charge up, then pop smoke and sit in this spamming torps. Once smoke clears, they pull back, recharge then repeat. Battleships sit as far back lobbing shells. Aircraft carriers are near impossible to make money with so hardly encountered. All in all, for a free game its worth a play I would wouldnt invest any cash into it or concern yourself with getting to tier 10 as its exactly the same as previous tiers, just more torp able ships.

I currently don't know bout the other servers on weekends) TLDR; Save yourself from stress and play another game during weekends unless you want to suffer.  Aircraft Carrier Saipan I don't see this as an issue though more like a heads up But Saipan is the queen of the skies at Tier 7 and the bane of aircraft carrier player when facing against most often the Saipan will win due to the captain having the air supriority skill or just a seasoned CV player is general.

Tier 8 does not exist anymore because your guarenteed to be put in a Tier 10 Battle. My other gripe is that when you work your way up to a desired ship that your after that has just been released, weeks later they will nerf it so all that hard work into thinking your getting the ship that was reviewed is removed, they should fully test the ship before reviewing it. Numerous occations i have worked hard to get these ships then in comes the nerf which makes the ship totally crap.Other than these gripes the game is awesome, i have played since the beta and have progressed through most of the ships.

Outfit your fleet with flags, camouflage, modifications, talented commanders, and more!World of Warships is one of the World of X titles in Wargaming portfolio, next to World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. It's a clash of 16-24 ships in PvE bot battles, scenario missions or PvP combat. You take control of a ship - quick and agile destroyer, slow and tanky battleship, somewhere-in-between cruiser or a plane carrier - and destroy other ships while trying to control strategic points on the map.WoWs looks very pretty and if you're interested in navy battles just play it. It's free after all. If you don't know if you're interested... It's a rather slow and strategic, mostly PvP, naval fight game. It's extremely fun even if you don't like PvP games and it can really suck you in. It's a squad based game, so your enjoyment greatly depends of the quality of your team. If your team is bad you will lose. Most often than not it's not possible to carry and, as there are no respawns, the margin for error is slim, even if you're amazing but have a bad team you will fail. And failing is not fun. I have to say I have a love hate relationship with this game as I love the idea, looks, music and pretty much everything, but bad teams make me hate it very much. For that hate moments there are bot battles though, these are easier and more fun even if less rewarding.As to the f2p aspect. The game can be enjoyed free for a long time. Having said that mind that in higher tiers - there are 10 - you can lose in-game money, needed for resupply, when playing normally. You can gain money playing lower tiers though, so it's not like you have to pay to play. If you want to pay the game can be extremely expensive with ships costing up to 50 euro per one (that's normal for these kind of games unfortunately, WarThunder is the same). Real world money gives you some more in-game money (needed for resupply and parts), xp (for captain skills) or cosmetics, but doesn't give you any additional power (like special ammo). Also while you can buy premium ships for money without any grinding you will not be proficient enough to succesfully play them. And most of them are great for collectors but so so for competitive play.One more thing, you have to invest time into the game. To not suck much in PvP you'll need ca. (20hrs * tier) of playtime, more or less, so for tier V you'll need about 100hrs of playtime to be proficient enough not to be a burden. Your milegae may vary.I liked:* looks, everything looks sooo pwetty* music* bot matches are fun and relaxing* PvP matches are fun and keep you on edgeI disliked:* it's multiplayer so expect lots of salt* if your team is bad you might not have any fun at all (most teams are bad)Get this if:* you're interested in navy battles and history, lots of classic ships like Perth, Yamato, Bismarck, Warspite, etc.* you like PvP games that don't require twitch reflexes* you like to watch pretty boats in a large pond (if you're less competitive just play low tier bot matches and enjoy)Don't get this if:* you cannot stand the salt in PvP* you cannot stand the grind (~100hrs are needed to get not bad, way more to get good; ~300hrs to get to tier 10 ships without buying premiums)",Wed Apr 28 04:31:20 EEST 2021,0e400d87-91f3-40e6-a915-8166d0af5ae7

Should you buy this game, then you best believe that you're going to spend at least 40-100+ hours playing it the first time around. It's not a waste of time, not at all. Call it an investment of your time. When it comes to this game, ""like"" is synonymous to ""addicted"". So telling others that you ""like"" the game is the same thing as hiding your addiction (so just accept it for what it is). Stardew Valley is also synonymous to ""productiveness"". No, it's actually the very definition of productivity, since you're going to wish you were as productive in real life as you are in-game.nn~~ [u] It starts with making your own character, choosing the farm that you think looks the best or most fun and also picking your companion pet. I'm not going to spoil you on what ""Favorite Thing"" is about. [/u]nnDuring the first few days of Stardew, I pretty much spent my time cleaning up the front yard of the farm. I just couldn't stand the sight of all that clutter and foliage on the ground and repeatedly getting stuck between twigs and rocks was surprisingly infuriating. Lewis, the Mayor of the town, had given me 15 parsnip seeds on my first day to help me with starting my farm. But ""cleaning"" took a lot more energy out of my character than I expected. I found it to be quite enjoyable breaking all of those rocks, cutting down the trees and mowing the grass, since it felt like I was actually cleaning for once. n     It wasn't until later that I would regret not starting with the farm earlier, since that would have meant getting more income in the earlier stages of the game. That's the thing with these types of games though. You are always going to regret making some of your decisions, whether it's buying the wrong types of crops or planting too many crops and wasting all your energy watering those crops each and every morning. Or you can be like me and do both of those examples at once on top of planting your crops way too late into the season.nnAnyways, I obviously got the materials for cleaning the farm, but it's not like I knew what to do with it. I ended up just making a few chests, changed their individual colors and then I began organizing everything that I had gathered. Which was basically just plant fiber, twigs, stones and then the occasional clay that I accidentally got from using the wrong tools on the wrong things. After that, I finally decided I would head into town to try and interact with as many people as possible in one day. I kept getting handwritten mail from characters I had yet to actually meet each and every morning, so naturally I became more and more curious of the town and less interested in cleaning. It took me around 3-4 days before I began to explore, but my farm was basically clear of anything that I might get stuck on further down the line so I didn't really feel like I wasted any time. n     I began my exploration quest with going into random buildings and interacting with every person I saw. Gus, the owner of ""The Stardrop Saloon"". Alex, his sweet grandmother, Evelyn and his very friendly Grandpa, George that I gave a Dandelion to because I was curious as to what would happen if I gave someone a gift. “This is probably the worst gift I've ever seen. Thanks a lot.” nNo, thank you George for that lovely comment.nnI also talked to Pierre, the owner of the general store and his wife (Caroline) and daughter (Abigail). This was also when I used the starting money to buy more crop seeds, tulips and parsnips because ""why not"" I remember thinking to myself... I then decided to head down south to look for this ""Willy"" guy that said he was waiting near the beach or something. On the way there I noticed a trash can that I for some reason decided to try and interact with. I then learned something very interesting. Interacting with a trash can is the same as ""searching"" the trash can and that naturally grosses people out. This is how I met a girl by the name of Haley. She just kind of stood there staring at me while I was digging through the trash, and I was staring back at her. Since it worked so beautifully before, I decided to give her a gift as well because I didn't know if people would start to hate you for doing, well, what I did. I would like to say that I ""learned from my mistakes"", but that wasn't the case at all, I can't even say that as a joke. Yes, you probably guessed it right, I gave her a Dandelion, thinking that ""She can't possibly hate them as much as George does right?""nn“Ugh...that's such a stupid gift.”nnThinking ""Haley must be related to George"", I reluctantly went down to the beach wondering if I should give Willy, the fisherman guy a Dandelion. As it turns out, I was to be the one on the receiving end. He gave me his rod and man, I never thought that such a simple fishing Minigame could be so fun. I stood there for the rest of the day, wasting away on my character's energy till I had no more. ""You feel sluggish from over-exertion."" It was the first time I was staying up past 12 in-game and my character was walking slower than ever before. I already knew beforehand that your character faints after 2 am, but the only way to make it back to bed in time would be to eat one of the fishes I had caught to regain my stamina. But I wasn't going to break, bend the knee to a fish and eat it raw like Gollum. I was going to sell them all no matter what. So yeah, I just fainted and sold them all the next day at the cost of some extra energy. Probably wasn't worth it, but I did get a few extra pennies that I wasted on buying more seeds. I should've saved up for a better fishing rod...nnSo anyways, good game",Thu Nov 12 11:01:24 EET 2020,d50d86f7-31c3-4b26-9b02-57a59ce24f0c

It's visually engaging, the ships handle well, particularly the fast cruisers they start you off with and timing your shots requires real skill. Finding a game is easy and level up fast and unlock quite a few ship classes rapidly, giving you a firm handle of the mechanics pretty fast: Battleships are slow and heavy hitting, Destroyers are fast and fire torpedoes, Cruisers mix speed with heavy cannons and Carriers play like a simple RTS, with you directing planes to attack enemy ships from the map.However, that's all it ever is. When you get Carriers at around level 4 you have experienced all the gameplay mechanics you ever will, which is unforunately the point at which you are expected to seriously grind to unlock the remaining 6 levels of ships. Each ship class has at most one or two abilities, none of which makes for a really compelling mechanic in themselves, and these don't really change as you level up. There's none of the diverging options you get from a MOBA, nor are the base classes particularly engaging either. Sure, the higher levels become more powerful or handle differently, but every battleship will be slow and hit hard, regardless of level 10 or level 4. There are zero differences in their skills. Unless of course you buy the upgrades or earn them through lootboxes.I honestly don't have a problem with the Pay2Win elements. Do I think the upcoming Stalingrad battleship and its unashamed overpoweredness stinks? Sure. But they aren't egregious at the low levels, and only become a problem at higher levels, which you will need a lot of patience to reach. There are obligatory loot boxes, but the stuff they provide again felt incredibly pointless, particularly when if your ship sinks it loses most of the upgrades on it. Honestly, considering that the flags and camo patterns add colour to an overwhelmingly grey game, it is a bit of shame that they are lost when your ship sinks. It would be much more interesting if they were permenant, purely visual, upgrades. In a game where only a few ships survive most games, it does make these upgrades feel trivial.There are a few remaining gripes I have.  The game REQURIES teamwork to be fun, but the devs have failed to create the tools which would engage the audience sufficiently in this. Being able to see the paths of your allies would be great. Being able to see what upgrade they are packing would make teamwork much easier. There is so much MISSING from this game's mechanics, which is baffling, as the devs have spent a lot of time and effort on the many ship classes. The carrier gameplay is dull. Incredibly dull. If you lose your fighters because your team didnt coordinate AA fire on the enemy fighters, then you are completely hobbled for the rest of the game as your bombers are picked off by the enemy. If you manage to succeed at gaining air superiority then be prepared for pointing bombers at targets on the map view for the whole game. To give you an idea: take Supreme Commander. Lock yourself to the most zoomed out view. Give yourself only 3 units. See how long it takes you to get bored. You essentially have WoW's Carrier game. There are a decent array of maps and gametypes, but they all play the same. There are objectives, but realistically they all boil down to deathmatch as the lack of a respawn means that if you knock out a battleship you're in a better position then capping the objective. So everyone just steams for an objective or two, the destroyers get knocked out first, then the battleships and cruisers arrive and slug it out. Every. Time.TLDR:A great base mechanic which invovles predicting the pace of enemies and positioning your ship which is unfortunately let down by a complete lack of creativity or style when it comes to the other mechanics.

Wargaming. This is an awful company you should think twice about throwing money at. WoT is notoriously infamous for it's inbalances and P2W policies. Gladly WoWS is not nearly as broken as WoT, but since we're talking about WG it's only a matter of time if you ask me. 2. Playerbase. It's not the toxicity, it's the unbelieveable incompetence that breaks the game, especially on weekends when all our beloved weekend warrios login. ""Blame the players, not the game"" is especially true in this game. Yes, the game is flawed, but ultimately what breaks the game is the people playing it. The second issue could easily be resolved by either implementing skill based MM or making ranked play more available (It's limited to short periods of time and specific tiers only).Unfortunately WG relies on those masses of extremely bad players, who godknowswhy oppose skill based MM, as source of income since the game is F2P, so nothing will change.

In order to unlock the other battleships you need to play as the kawachi first, this means you're the most disadvantaged player on the battlefield, most destroyers can literally beat you just by sniping you from miles away giving you no chance of ever hitting them. So you're literally forced to kamikaze as a battleship(Second biggest ships to aircraft carriers btw) hoping you do some damage or get a kill, then play on your phone until the battle finishes and finally you can repeat the process until maybe after an afternoon and ngiht you have a slightly better ship (The miyogi IV) which is still awful. You might say ""Well they offer premium ships"" and you'd be correct, I saw this option and decided to buy a tier IV class battleship(that severely outclasses any regular teir IV battleship i might add) for $6 to get myself on the ground and skip the awful grind of the kawachi, for about 6-7 hours i played as my new ship and had some of the most fun a warship game has ever given me, smooth controls, fast ship, accurate and long range weapons only to realize after gaining around 11,000xp that none of that can be spent on the tech tree unless you convert the XP with the in game purchased currency. Which is absurd seeing how i paid for the ship, now i have to pay to use the experience i gained with the ship? How is that fair, that solidates the fact i will never buy anything else on this game because the standard it sets is just purchasing your way through the teirs whenver you start losing too much. And i get why they make the frist few battleships difficult to grind through, because they know if it was as easy as just playing a tenryuu everyone would just play as the battleships. but still they're making their point way too hard. and the fact that i feel like Forrest Gumps shrimping boat could body me definitely rubs me the wrong way. But honestly if you plan on playing anything but battleships the game is incredibly fun and you wont find much difficulty, if you want to play the ships advertised in the name and pictures get your vaseline and your♥♥♥♥♥ready.",Thu Sep 09 15:50:18 EEST 2021,c6c4bc44-44ab-44ac-9695-ac714ea1b898

The victorian setting and subtle music do a great job of building atmosphere, the blood powers all sound really cool. The balance of feasting on london's citizens for xp, but risking plunging the city into chaos is a very cool concept that should make being a vampire (vampyr?) very enging.nnIt doesn't matter how cool the blood powers are, because combat sucks. You move like your underwater, and combined with a poorly implemented stamina system, combat feels sluggish and inaccurate. Even if you do prefer a more methodical combat system, there are plenty of glitches that add to the frustration. Sometimes blood abilities won't activate properly; they'll play their animation and go on cooldown, but have no effect. This is especially frustrating when it happens to your ultimate ability, which has a hefty 100 second cooldown. Sometimes grab attacks will still hit even if you have invincibility frames during dodging. nAlso, sometimes enemies become un-targetable and immune to your abilities; I'm unsure whether this is a glitch, or just poor game design. Probably a little of column A and a little of column B.nnDecisions matter . . . except they don't. Several hours into the game, nurse crane begins blackmailing someone. If you learn about her life and unlock clues about her backstory, you can use your mesmer powers to make her forget her blackmail material. This causes her to become a feral vampire, with no explanation. This is the worst non-sequitur I saw, but there are plenty of other less egregious but still frustrating disconnects between action and consequence.nnThe writing is akward and stilted. You ask people a series of questions, and they give robotic and boring responses. They all have a distinct lack of personality, all the characters arevery cardboard. There is a 'romance' in the game, that boils down to 'boy vampire and girl vampire therefore in love'. If you like games for the story, there's nothing for you here.nnFinal note, the load times are horrifying. I have a pretty powerful computer, and load times were regularly three minutes long. Every time you enter a new area, exit one, or die, you get to chill in the worlds slowest loading screen until you are completely un-invested in whatever quest you were pursuing.nnThis game is not worth your money; and if you already bought it or received it as a gift, then it isn't worth your time either",Tue Aug 18 19:24:05 EEST 2020,27fda8a0-9a59-4f0b-9b0c-04c91e41774c

If that's what you're looking for as an old player then sure, it's a thumbs up.

This is not a good game, and the publisher/developer behind it is not worth supporting. This game sells a power fantasy to the highest bidder and keeps people engaged through the same triggers as a slot-machine.In short: The game itself suffers from horrendous balance issues and blatant pay-to-win problems. The developers have consistently been deceiving, insulting, and even threatening the playerbase. The game is player-vs-player focused. It features ships from various points in time. There is a progression system for advancing up tiers in a tech-tree. There are numerous different tech trees for different nations. You earn credits and XP from battles - winning, killing ships, dealing damage, capturing objectives, and spotting enemies all award you varying amounts of credits and XP. In a battle, you can have ships of various nations and various types distributed amongst 2 teams. Furthermore, you can have ships of varying tiers. Up to tier 4, you will always either be in a highest tier ship or only ships one tier above yours in the battle. Starting at Tier 5, ships can be up to 2 tiers higher than yours. The higher tier the ships, the more powerful they are. So the game is inherently designed around you wanting to get to higher tier ships, so you can more easily beat your opponents. If you are in a Tier 10 cruiser facing off against a Tier 8 cruiser, you will probably win - same if you are in a Tier 10 Destroyer, Battleship, or Aircraft Carrier. You can either try to make the most of your ship and let yourself be pummled over and over again by higher tier ships (with the occasional game where you are the one beating the lower-tier enemies), or you can pay money to skip past lower tier ships rather quickly and directly upgrade to higher tier ships. The higher your tier ship, the better the odds of you being in a top-tier match. However, ship progression is far from the only progression present in the game. In fact, it's probably one of the least important progression systems present in the game. What probably amounts to the most important progression system is the captain system. On any ship, you can slot a captain. This captain gains XP along with your ship - and once you accrue enough XP, you unllock a skill point for him to spend. These captain skills are incredibly powerful - making your ship that has a seasoned veteran just straight up better than the equal tiered opponents you face that do not have a captain of their own to match yours. If you wish to advance to a ship and take your captain along, your captain suffers what is called ""retraining"". During this time, you need to play with the captain on your ship to grind out XP to ""familiarize"" him with the new ship. The problem? The more you invested into your captain before, the longer retraining takes on a new ship. Except you can spend money to by-pass this problem entirely. Keep in mind that these captain skills are not trivial. There are entire ship classes (like destroyers or light cruisers) for whom these captain skills are essential to deal damage and survive. Without the correct captain skills, they are simply anemic XP and credit Pinatas for the enemy team. Additionally, Wargaming (the developer/publisher) has  the habit of continously powercreeping content with new ships released. That means that unless you invest an unfeasible amount of time into this game or fork over vast quantities of money, the line you are grinding will easily be obsolete in a few months, displaced by something that is just straight up better. They will milk the paying players for money and let them have overpowered ships for a few months. They eventually nerf these ships once the people who are likely to spend money to get them have done so, and then announce a new line a month or two later that will repeat the cycle. Additionally, this game features premium consumables and premium ships. Premium consumables are buy-for-each-battle items, that are direct upgraded versions over regular consumables. You can either pay exorbitant, non-sustainable amounts of in-game credits for, or you can pay real money for premium account time, premium camoflagues, buy in-game currency, or premium currency, all of which enable you to continously use these consumables. Premium ships are ships that you can only attain by paying money for them. They are virtually never changed from their initial state. They are typically released along with new ship lines. This means that while newly released regular ships are just as good as the premium counterparts, the premium ships will remain overpowered, while the regular ships are subject to balance changes. Just think about that; if you pay real money for a ship, it will never be nerfed. In a PvP game. When players point out the disparity between regular ships and premium ships, the developers will do any combination of the following things:    Remove the ship from sale, but not the game - usually with a ""buy now before you can't"" announcement  Degrade the players for ""just being bad"" and ""not being good"" (a blatant lie - the premium ships are just superior in stats)  Censor threads and videos calling them out, and even threaten legal action. None of this even addresses the combat in this game, which is absolutely attrocious. All guns you shoot in this game have dispersion. Absolutely staggering amounts of dispersion. We are talking ""divine intervention"" levels of dispersion here. (https://youtu.be/0Ae6B7C05Nk?t=1m6s) You can be randomly one-shot from a single shell striking your ship. Fires and flooding (damage over time effects) are based off of chance. And you can pay real money to skew the chances in your favor. ""Oh boy, will the salvo I just fired instantly obliterate that ship over there?"" The sound effects in the game itself mirror those you might hear on slot machines. Big explosions, sounds effects, and all. This game is fundamentally manipulative, deceiving, and exists to give a power fantasty to those willing to pony up the cash. I would go so far as to label it and its makers as evil. Please, do not play this.",Thu Nov 26 01:04:06 EET 2020,dc13a546-d3de-4cc2-bd7b-2c364f054999

Episodic graphic adventure games are usually not my cup of tea when it comes to gaming, but after a friend convinced me to play it I hopped on with very low expectations. Ow boy, how wrong I was to misjudge this game at the start... The story goes from your daily high school struggles to a warped time travel multi-dimensional masterpiece!nnAlmost all characters in the game have their own problems and story to tell, which makes you want to come back after playing the full story once. Your choices in this game impact the final outcome heavily and characters won't forget if you did something mean to them in the past! You start to care for almost everyone that you cross paths with in this well executed ""crime"" story by Squire Enix. nnDid I cry? YES (obviously). I burned through 10 tissue boxes during the final two epsiodes alone! This game teaches you that making choices in life is hard, and once you made the wrong one you can not ""just go back in time"" to fix it all. Sometimes sacrifces have to be made. For the worst or the better. nnThe game also has it's flaws. The puzzles the game present sometimes break story momentum (searching for 5 bottles on a junkjard) at places where it should be exhilarating. I felt this the most when you have to bring a picture into focus by finding it's ""sweet spot"" to travel back in time to that event on said picture. Doing this once was fun, but doing this for almost every picture onwards made it very tedious and fustrating. nnI would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to play a timetraveling Sherlock Holmes.

I don't need another only to start over from scratch. Uninstalled.... Back to original client...Edit: Since people would rather have my opinion of the game. I will say this. The game is definitely worth playing. Don't get me wrong. Great graphics, great strategic gameplay, and plenty of ships to grind on various beautiful looking maps. I've played this game on and off for years, (Since Closed Alpha), and I will continue to play it. World of warships as a whole gets my Recommended rating. The fact that veteran players who have been asking for steam integration for years, are forced to create a new account is absolute crap. Sure, you can do some majic, delete some files, and poof you can log into your account. Having to go about it that way, shows me the devs are lazy if you can go around easily bypassing their forced steam login. But that's no surprise there I guess, though Wargaming overall I've always supported in one way or another. But the decision to make the Steam Client and the WoWs client was a poor decision in my opinion. Just splits and spreads the playerbase out on more servers that can't even cross play with one another. I do hope to see some improvements in the future.

Only downloaded the steam verison for convenience.The game is very visually impressive, i don't think i've seen anything more beautiful in a vido game than firing a full broadside in a battleship, or having your machine guns light up enemy aircraft.The issue i have is the gameplay. PvP is extremely passive, slow and unfun, for me at least. Wargaming seems to have an inconsistant method of applying ""realism"" to the game. They make the ranges for primary guns realistic (but not the sceondaries, for example) to the detriment of gameplay.WoWs is devided into 4 classes. A generalist class, being the Cruiser, a Support Class, being the Aircraft Carriers, and 2 Specialist Classes, being the Destroyers and Battleships, holding the roles of Harassers/Pickers and Tanks respectivly.Battleships, the ""tank"" class, has the highest Armor and Health, and the most powerful Primary Guns, as well as a large compliment of secondary guns for use at close range. A big issue here is that Batlleships primaries are also the longest ranged weapons in the game, which is realistic, but feeds into a few major issues. A High-Health class with that has a long-ranged attack is, by nature of the long range weapons, encouraged to hang back at maxium range to pick people off with the high burst-damage attacks, rather than push in and brawl with opponents at close range, as the secondary armament, as well as the supposed teamplay and counterbalance between Battlehsips and other classes such as the more versitile curiser would entail. From this you might conclude that battleships are Overpowered, but, removing thier range advantage, they're really not. With thier pluses comes their minuses. Battleships have the tankiest armor and health, but also have poor speed and trash manuverabaility. Thier Primaries are powerful sources of damage, but require a long time to reload inbetween shots, generally around 30 seconds per shot, and turn extremely slowly. Secondaries provide useful support damage at close range, but can *only* fire at close range, and are very innacurate, especially against small a nimble destroyers.All these weaknesses would be very exploitable in close-range battles, but because the Battleship's long range can allow it to sit well outside close range battles, rendeirng all these weaknesses irrelavant. Slow reload time and turret turn speed would hurt a brawling Battleship's ability to respond to new targets attacking at different directions, but because the Battleship is at long range, there's only ever one direction it needs to face. New targets are always a quick couple of degrees of turn away. Anything past that, and you're out of position, and will get focused or ambushed to death. Poor secondary range and accuracy is only a factor to consider if secondaries are given the oppuritunity to fire, which a Battleship at long range never provide. That minor extra damage isn't considered worth pushing forward to get focused by enemy long-range fireCruisers are the generalist class, supposedly good at everything, but not *great* at anything. It's medium damage, but fast-reloading primaries ideally would make great support fire for allied ships in brawls, being particularly decent at attacking destroyers, and chiping away at Battleships with fire damage form explosive shells, as well as providing specialized anti-air support against enemy fighters. The long range of battles hurts Cruisers, however.Cruisers have less range than thier Battleships counterparts, and so generally play second fiddle to them if they are present, relying on numbers advantages to attack enemy Battleships, since they cannot take advantage of map terrain due to the longer range, and so sit at a ""meh"" grade of power in the game.Destroyers, the Picker and Harasser class, are represented as the rock-paper-scissors counter to Battleships, which they are... at close range. Thier torpedos deal heavy, heavy damage depsite being slow-moving, which battleships (and some larger cruisers) at close range are generally unable to avoid very easily. But because, like we've well established by now, Battleships, and now Cruisers have no reason to come into close range, Destroyers are relegated to a vulture role of patiently wiating behind map terrain waiting for someone to overextend so they can be ambushed, since closing the distance regularly is a harder task. Destroyers have the highest manuverability and speed of any ship class in the game, as well as the smallest and thus hardest-to-hit profile, which gives them an advantage at avoiding slow-moving enemy shells at a distance, as well as the ability to deploy a smokescreen to provide artificial cover for themselves and teammates, but all of trivial effect if they are not within fighting range to begin with. All it takes is one lucky Battleship volley to take down a lightly-armored destroyer, and if an enemy destroyer at range is always inside an enemy Battleship's line-of-sight, a hit will happen at some point.Aircraft carriers, the indirect fire support class, are affected by the range issue in both ways. By nature of controlling planes in an rts-like fahsion, Carriers have the freedom to sit at extreme ranges, letting thier planes quickly fly to thier targets over the heads of allied ships, exceeding the range of even battleships by technicality. Carriers however, have no primary guns with which to defend themselves, armed with only secondary guns, if any at all, making them very vunerable to focus fire when in-range of an enemy, and so, like battleships, are encouraged to sit at maximum range, generally behind an island, or at the edge of the map. This is an issue in a couple ways. Firstly, it causes aircaft support to have long periods of downtime, as planes must travel long distances to and from thier target, reducing thier ability to play the game, and relegating aircraft to an ocasional danger to outliers in the group, rather than a near-constant threat that affects player positioning and movement, even if Aircraft are a powerful weapon. The second issue is that, again, carriers have poor abilities to defend themselves, and so, unless guarded by an escort willing to take themselves out of the battle, are essentially screwed if any enemy ship - generally destroyers - finds them at thier end of the map; Carriers are unable to recieve the passive support of thier teammates due to the danger of ranged focus fire, and so in turn are less able to support thier teammates.For these reasons, I personally find PvP to be very stale, passive and unfun. Matches very often pass the 20 minute limit due to how slow games are. I personally find Co-Op and PvE gamemodes to be more enjoyable, for the simple reason that Bots aren't afriad to be agressive. In PvE gamemodes, a double-broadside of secondary fire is not uncommon, and gameplay is more dymaic by way of taking advantage of the map layout. But due to how dumb/easy bots are, and due to the reduces rewards you get from PvE modes means your progrssion is going to be painfully slow unless you play a lot of PvP, which, for the pace it has, does not really interest me.And, attempting to discuss the issues (that i find are issues at least) in the community has, in my experience, generally been met with indifference or been provided with non-answers such as ""get good"", and the developers don't seem to be in a position to change thier game on these issues, probably due to popularity issues in the echo-chamber compettitive/higher tier players.Play it if you like playing slow, passive games i suppose.",Tue Apr 14 07:56:55 EEST 2020,d015b281-ec8c-43e5-94be-3acfa8938f63

A short adventure, but one well worth the visit.nnWhile their WalkingDead games are great on their own, this has more creative agency that permeates throughout the experience. Not to say WD is uncreative, yet the zombie apocalypse narrative is a constant we've had for years, and one that won't truly ever go away. At most I find the relationship between Lee and Clementine to be the most interesting. While other characters of that series has a point, the central focus is those two without a doubt. So it's good, just not my thing. As well comparing the two, Wolf Among Us just objectively has a unique idea that while has been done before, hasn't been done as often or at the very least hasn't been done very well often. That is, blending fantasy creatures with a more modern civilization vibe.nnWhile you play as 'the big bad wolf' of fables of old, and despite being grounded in a mix of real life and fairytale atmosphere, all the characters feel human even when they clearly aren't. Not only is it a detective narrative, it can be of a redemption arc, or a grim dive into how ruthless one can be on personal goals for answers, and the cost of being uncaring of others. The adventure is not only finding answers to the mystery at large, but it's also about defining how to act during hard trials. Trials that would make others into worse versions of themselves, now matter how well intended they are. Or an exercise into wanting to be the worst person ever if you wish lol.nnWhile WD has characters that sometimes ultimately feel like throw'aways to me, here, it feels like everyone matters. Be their roles minor or not. What makes this stand out to me is how heartfelt it all is, and how cunning the forces you're put against are. As well, the overall atmosphere and tone. nnSpeaking of tone, the music, a phenomenal mix of classic instruments and synth balancing a distinct dance of being fantastical and depressing. Often bringing focus to many things properly, or bringing that serious somber but we can get things done kind of vibe. As well, I believe it takes place in 80s or 90s, so you'll be hard pressed to find many things of a techy nature.nnWolf Among Us is like being stuck in the rain by yourself, for a time. You feel alone, things don't feel right, you light a cigarette or enjoy whatever vice to whatever small degree you could while the world phases out you even exist, up until you're taken in by the company of someone unexpected, unsure to turn them away for knowing the hurt of trusting prior, but knowing you can't do things alone.nnIt's a narrative journey that will make you feel alone, but the same time not. On your way to uncovering what is going on hurting others, you'll find very realistic examples of struggle even fairytale characters will endure such as price inflation for things needed to keep their lives the way they want, addictions to things they know they must stop but are ultimately alone, or their attempts to recapture the past that made them so happy but are now a somber long distant dream losing themselves to their fears. nnThis game won't change your life likely, but, it'll make you think a lot about stuff. How you treat folk around you, how to act better in some cases, or to maybe understand some folk better.nnCause at the end of it all, you don't have to be as bad as folk think you are.

As a couple of my friends put it, half the features are bugs that got left in because the dev liked them; it's a horrifying mess with a skill floor that starts where other games have a ceiling, and a skill ceiling that may or may not exist.nn(Also, the lore depicts the battle represented in the game as a final cataclysm between good and evil that will destroy the world no matter who wins, which is amusing to think about considering how many times it's been played out by the game's millions of fans.)nnTaken altogether, Dota 2 seems very much like a product of people who got so incredibly attached to one very particular experience that they built everything else around it - and this is the important part - warts and all. People apparently spend massive amounts of time and money on what is essentially a glorified Warcraft III mod that itself has many mods, though, so it at least proves the viability of game modding.nnThis is also the product that's mainly responsible for killing the old Valve, the one that produced quality games on a semi-regular basis. Thanks to the massive popularity of Dota, and to an extent Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Valve was content to sit on their butts iterating on them while screwing around with VR and reaping that store/market/microtransaction money for an entire decade before they managed to stop pretending the franchise that made them didn't exist and release Half-Life: Alyx.nnI at least liked the snazzy main menu and the Half-Life 2 doot noises. Inclusion of the Counter-Strike AWP firing noise on the other hand just bewildered me",Wed May 19 09:57:49 EEST 2021,f4cc81f3-b21c-4458-85b8-7053fcf65c92

Similar to the first game, you need a mod for full controller support in this game. Also let it be known that you cannot access the ULC content that came in the no-longer-sold deluxe edition. All you miss are Altair's robes from AC, 5 extra throwing knives, and 4 Assassin puzzles across the world. There is a way to obtain that missing content but I have not tried it because it requires messing with saves.nnThe soundtrack, gameplay loop, and story were decent in Assassin's Creed, but Assassin's Creed II upgrades all of these and even hold up in 2022. The soundtrack in this game is incredible and each city has a unique soundtrack that may play while exploring unlike Assassin's Creed. Collectibles are not too bad, I 100% synchronized the game in 31 hours. The main story is wonderful and is a great start to a powerful trilogy. My only complaint regarding gameplay is killing 9 targets in the late game all across Florence, I find those missions to feel very ""filler"" compared to the rest of the sequences.

Actually, in the beginning you get better ships faster than your skill improves.Sure, later on XP and credit accumulation is slow, but again this game is enjoyable at all levels, so unless you the 'endgame' guy, just kick back and go with the slow flow.I did spend around $10 to support the devs, and it is useful for getting ship slots so that I don't need to sell low-tier ships (as I progress) I'm still enjoying.Talking about slow flow, this is a great PVP shooter with a relaxed pace, especially with larger ships. Tactics, situational awereness and careful aim are key, not reflexes.As with all team-play based PVP games, you do get into bad teams - it is what it is, not the game's fault. But in general I think the community is decent.Graphics, music is fantastic, well optimized game. Servers are great, matchmaking is fast.Love of these magnificent ships can be certainly felt, there are dev-made historical videos on YT - there is a fair chance you will get interested in the topic. I did.So yeah, can't really say much bad about it, this free game is batter than most $30-40 games out there, in fact the best new game I tried since years!",Sat Aug 14 01:43:19 EEST 2021,275eb561-d0d8-4b01-9aa4-25c3833356f8

(I do not feel anyone should spend real money on this game) So I bought the ship and the AI came after me almost instantly by passing other ships. I was sunk in the first few min of the first 3 matches. Keep in mind before using this ship I would almost always last the full match with out being sunk!. SO i put it to the test. I was last into the battle and made sure others shot first at the AI (the carrier and Battleship held back at range so they where not in the heat). I opened with one volley and 3 AI ships instantly targeted me and sunk me!

It greatly improved upon the game in every aspect with refined gunplay, a higher budget to improve the story, acting, the classic comic book cutscenes, and more advanced AI. It still keeps all of the core elements that made Max Payne so good by creating a depressing Noire York that now has constant rain instead of the snow in the last game. The story is also much more complex than the original's plot furthering this by allowing you to take control of Mona Sax who is a more integral part of the plot. Also the attention to detail in this game was crazy for the time allowing you to interact with a wide array of objects around you and putting you in a much more destructible environment. Max Payne 2 still holds up very well today unlike Max Payne which needed a lot more work to patch it up and still had issues with getting stuck on geometry. Max Payne two isn't without issues though, having to be completely fixed to run (which you can solve by altering the files after looking up a video), tedious levels like the one with Vinnie Gognitti in the Captain Baseball Bat Boy costume and him getting stuck on geometry with the door  in his apartment. The game was difficult for me on normal but was far less challenging than the original Max Payne with the straight up broken bullet time allowing you to completely ignore the jump bullet time and run around while everyone else is in slo-mo. Apart from that relatively minor list of complaints this game is a worthy sequel that was as enjoyable if not more so than the original Max Payne",Fri Aug 27 16:28:50 EEST 2021,b05c1e72-81f3-4a22-b71b-28005d3aa71c

The fact that this game came out in 1996 and it still feels fun to play in in 2022 should tell you how well the game design in this is (which is to put lightly F**KING FANTASTIC!!). The gameplay feels like it hasn't age a bit (the same can't be said about the graphics, but I don't mind it and I think the chunkyness adds to the feel of the game). I could go on and on about other aspects of the game (especially the music and sound design) but I feel like other people could do a better job at praising this game then I can.  nnThe only negatives I have with this game are really just 2 small nitpicks. One I don't think the bosses are anything to impressive, you just press a few buttons and you're done, and two I REALLY HATE those little blue creatures that lunge at you and explode (I think they're called Spawns but I could be wrong). nnSo a quick message to those people who are my age or younger and like FPS game.

Probably the only game ive played in recent years that strives for historical accuracy unabashedly. You can really tell these people take pride in their heritage. For me this is huge, you're not gonna find any other game that does that. It isn't afraid to punish you either. You embark on this journey as a humble peasant, you must eat, sleep, learn how to read, fight, and engage in mundane and otherwise servile tasks to move up in the world. The combat is clunky at first but rewarding once you acquire some skills from Bernard and become more adept at it. I think for an original combat system it works surprisingly well. The world could use a few more touches, like maybe a few more species of wild life roaming around and some more interesting locations for you to discover, but this is more than offset by the fact that every quest has a compelling backstory and really feels like you are effecting the trajectory of the world around you.

[17/20⭐, 10h🏅, 4/5💡]nnI’ve played Braid back when it came out, and to be honest, the game never really clicked with me back then. When revisiting it after all these years, and often seeing it lists of greatest games in the meantime, I was kind of hoping for a “how could I have been so blind"" moment. But it never came.nnNot that I have anything bad to point out. The main mechanic of the game is controlling how time flows. The puzzles are challenging enough, medium-hard, and each world introduces a different mechanic to time control that keeps the game fresh. But for some reason I didn’t feel the satisfaction I often feel in other games when finally solving a difficult puzzle. Probably because of some precision and timed puzzles, which are really not my cup of tea.nnThe story didn’t really do anything for me. I’m all for obscure and ambiguous plots, but here the story felt so disconnected from the actual gameplay that it felt forced. (There are several theories online, none particularly convincing.) The design and soundtrack are pleasing, but again nothing really memorable.nnPS: I absolutely hate speedrun achievements in puzzle platform games, if that's really what the developers are expecting players to master, I'm really not the target audience. In retrospective, this might have affected my review",Mon Mar 01 23:46:31 EET 2021,8f40a290-99b9-455c-bcca-12e2b528e8d1

In fact, my initial impression wasn't favourable as I wasn't used to such graphics and action point-based turn-based combat. It wasn't until the midgame that I really got into the game. Since then, Fallout 1 has remained my favourite isometric RPG. It might not be as good as Fallout 2 in terms of replayability, size and sandbox elements, but it's Fallout 1 that has this unique hopeless and desolate atmosphere of the post-apocalypse.

My entire purpose was to grind till I got to tier 10 so i can play with my friends and get competive in clan matches. Im currently at tier 9 and i am losing credits each game so i cant lvl anymore. For example,I played a match at tier 9 where i have PREMIUM, plus 50% credit flag, i contributed to my team, i stayed alive and we won the fight....... and i lost -13000 credits!

And WG used this ""reason"" to chat ban me.OK, chat banned, no problem. So I contacted the supporting staff to remove the ban. Do they have the authority or ability to remove the ban? Sure, I have seen some other players' chat ban been relieved after contacting supporting guys. But this time, the supporting guy (A*** M*****) said they were incapable to remove chat bans.So that guy obviously lied about what they can do, and I pointed it out. You guess what happened? WG simply said, WG wouldn't talk about whether he lied or not, but two sentences twice per battle is SPAMMING and that deserves a chat ban.

If you are drawn to it by KantaiCollection like me, you will marginally be disappointed but nevertheless still impressed by it, and hey the mods can fix your addiction, even through the mods are of extremely poor quality, the limitations placed on them are a factor i presume, for me slapping kancolle(and other) art on ship skins is indeed poor quality.While all is good and the game is satisfying to play, WarGaming themselves are taking it in the wrong direction since the beginning and that shows, part of it has to do with insane 40 to 60 euro prices for ONE premium ship, the only vanilla skin in the game so far is the Bismark skin which you cant get anymore, and camouflages which are a consumable that pretty much ruin the look of ships to me. They have done a good job with the Halloween event ship skins for one mission available during halloween, but that is it. Personally i feel like ships skins and maybe even voice packs(preferably in cooperation with kantai collection team) would be the right direction instead of ultra expensive ships.Okay aside from that, you got premium account benefits which frankly are equivalent to nothing. Let me put it like this, the major problem you will inevitably face is buying a new ship which requires EXP obtained only and only by the previous ship in a line of tiers to unlock the next tier, and game currency to buy the next ship. The EXP itself is a massive grind you have to go through at high tiers, especially for casual players ( i play for 2 and now close to 3 years casually and i still only just got to tier 9 out of 10, getting to 10 is much harder due to: read on), and CREDITS(game currency) the game offers you a insane ammount at the start to buy your ships, this will take you to atleast tier 7 maybe as you get some from grind too. Now heres how it works, you get credits, like exp, from participating in battles(grinding) roughly around 50k to 100k on a good game, and lets be real you wont be as good as youtubers of this game and be the carry to get a more than that, the problem again rises when you reach tiers 8,9,10 where the cost(yes there is a credits cost) to enter a battle with X ship is pretty much higher than the credits reward for winning/losing the battle, this becomes extremely obvious with tier 9 ships where even if you win, if you plaid poorly you are still in the negative... so... the tiers at which the game is most fun, the developers pretty much said no to that.Now what im getting at is premium account time MARGINALLY fixes this, you get more EXP per battle so theres less grind, and more money and lower deployment cost(participating in game) this basically makes it like this, people say its efficient for non premiums to farm with tier 5-6 for money to buy and play tier 9-10 ships, and this is an insane grind ( i forgot to mention credit costs to buy ships go from 5 million at lower tiers to over 10 million credits for tier 9 or 10 )  so instead, with premium account time, you can farm money with tier 6-7 without losing money if you dont win the game.Theres EXP conversion cost which means you convert EXP accumulated with a ship ( the one you grind with duh ) to something called Free EXP that can instead be used to unlock ( and then buy if you got the credits ) any ship, this costs real money currency and the same system is in place for commanders and resetting commander skills (im not going to get into this) both of which have a decent cost, but the cost being decent is a direct result of how insane the grind has to be in the first place, which is not a good thing. On top of which you dont outright buy Free exp, commander EXP.. etc, you first grind it and pay to convert it to, hopefully, be used on buying t9 and 10 only.All in all a very great core game with rotten wargaming elements, i do recommend it because its extremely satisfying to play, the explosion sounds which they keep improving, that time you get citadel hits(massive dmg) all is very fun to play and everyone should give it a try.",Tue Jul 14 20:43:08 EEST 2020,966b1047-95b1-4dcb-ac15-4720d181d1aa

More frantic than Amnesia, more intelligent than Outlast, Alien Isolation is a pulse-pounding ride that takes you into the very heart of the Alien universe. I don't think I'm wrong in stating it's pretty much the best thing this franchise has seen since 1986's Aliens. It's like playing a brand new movie, set in Hollywood's most realistically terrifying set ever, and you're the hapless protagonist. nPlaying as Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda, you'll take a nightmarish journey to Sevastopol station deep in the far reaches of space, stalked by a fearsome xenomorph that behaves, thinks and kills with incredible realism. The alien's artificial intelligence is nothing short of groundbreaking. If alerted to your presence, it is drawn to your general whereabouts, but is never guided to your exact location - instead it searches feverishly for you until you either make a life-ending mistake or it moves on. Even when the game gives you a revolver, a shotgun and a flamethrower, you're as vulnerable as ever and your encounters with the near-invisible creature are almost always nail-biting. There are few things as hair-raising as sneaking around and hearing the alien let out a monstrous roar as it's spotted you. And the sound of those huge feet on the floor? Yikes. nThe game can take a while to get going, but this is hardly an issue - believe me, there's a lot in store. Perhaps overstaying its welcome just a little, the story fits neatly into the Alien canon and I'm sure any fan worth his or her salt will appreciate the sheer IMMENSE level of detail this game has to offer. I'm amazed that the game runs as smoothly as it does with so much going on in the environment. Visually, this game is a solid 10/10. It is honestly like stepping into a big budget Alien movie, with Ridley Scott in the director's chair. The sounds, the music, the flashing lights, everything is bang-on perfect. nAt worst the game becomes repetitive, but on the bright side it's a lot more replayable than games like Outlast or Layers Of Fear thanks to R.N.G. nIt's seriously disappointing that Creative Assembly was never brought on to try their hand at a similar style of game set in perhaps the Jurassic Park or Predator franchises. Alas, most of the developers that worked on Alien Isolation are no longer with the company... guess they were hired by Weyland-Yutani.nDespite 'weak' sales reported by Sega, Alien Isolation will no doubt be held in very high regard for the rest of time; it is an excellent survival-horror experience, complete with limited Resident Evil-style saving. I myself even resented the game when I first experienced it, but, having attained all achievements on three different platforms for it, it's safe to say my opinion has changed. Give it a chance! nSevastopol station is a very creepy place to run amok in, and once you have enough of the right tools and resources you're practically free to explore the station as an open-world experience (though there is little need to do this outside of collectable-hunting, admittedly.)  nOn a slightly more negative aspect of this review, I'm now briefly going to discuss the wonderful survivor mode. And by wonderful I mean terrible. Most of this mode is made up by D.L.C, but the first map comes free with the base game. The map name is called The Basement, a non-canon quest for survival in, well, a basement... in space. Completing the side missions in this mode grants you more points, so you can compete in the leaderboards against other players, but take one look at the worldwide scores and you'll see practically every other player is a hacking scumbag who amazingly managed to finish the map in 0 seconds. So that's always fun. But, speaking of those side missions, the game doesn't even let you know where they are, so you have to explore the area with an aggressive alien prowling after you. I just don't have the patience for this, so I just make a dash straight for the map exit and call it a day. Word of advice, don't get too excited about survivor mode. I will discuss the D.L.C maps in my reviews on their respective Steam store pages. nI've already talked about the alien and its shockingly clever A.I, but the androids almost steal the show in Alien Isolation. The Working Joe androids are, in every sense of the word, horrifying. You had me at the glowing red eyes, but the cue ball-white, bald heads and the Superman strength? That's a lot of nope. To top it all off, their voices are spoken with gravelly, patronising English accents. They're the complete package. Imagine Ash from the first Alien film but ten times scarier. nMy strongest bit of advice for you before starting the game is to watch the film! It should teach you everything you need to know about the world of Alien, and the alien itself of course. Oh, and it's also one of the greatest sci-fi horrors of all time, so there's that. nHop aboard Sevastopol and embrace the terrors that await. Maybe there'll be some... closure for you.

For example, all Japanese cruisers from level 5 have a 203 mm caliber of guns, all Americans are 150 mm, and so on.It is clear that it is very difficult to think up differences of similar ships in general, so that the user has a feeling that they are all different, but why then as many as 10 levels.In addition to not understanding why a ship similar in general costs twice as much as it is at a higher level, the balancer throws all the players with a difference of 2 levels of technology in one battle.Those. 5 lvl plays with 7 lvl, 7lvl with 9lvl and so on. Beginners suffer and are angry with the developers. To all other things, the modules of the purchased ship are initially rather weak, and when buying tops the ship, as a rule, is transformed. Gets penalties for perks and a transplanted captain.As a result, the player swims with a slow recharge, turn of the steering wheel and other joys of life and the development of developers in vain.Why this was doing and injuring the players, it is unclear. Maybe the developers themselves were traumatized in their childhood and they harbored resentment?It was possible to make 3 levels - beginners, everything that floated before the 2nd world, middle class - the most massive second world and paper projects like high-level content for clans, etc.As a result, new players enter the game and set themselves a goal to pump the conditional Yamato, for which it is necessary to collect more than 1,000,000 experience points. At the same time, there are both playable ships in the branch, as well as frank cacti, which the developer is rumored to introduce, so that players pass them for free experience through donate.Rushing up to Yamato, it becomes obvious that it was just a trap of developers, because the game on it, as on any top ten gives a stable minus even with a premium account. As a result, in order to ride on the top you need to farm silver on the ships, and this is a separate topic.Regarding the prema, I still do not get tired of being surprised by the logic of the WG. You make a technique that, according to the logic of your game, users will have to play the lion's share of time, to accumulate money and experience on it and to pump the captain.Why, then, does the technician necessarily have a flaw that makes it uncomfortable with respect to conventional ships.Why am I buying a tank or a ship for $ 50 I do not get a sense of advantage, and even vice versa.Separately, I want to say that the premium strategy is also used by the VG to replenish online at certain levels of the game with intent. In brief I will say that in the game 2 comfortable levels of technology - 4LVL and 7Lvl.4 level is comfortable, because by the mechanics of the game it throws a maximum against 5, so you will not have much superiority over you. Especially since level 5 throws on the feed to 7, so on the four you will often play in the top or among the brethren.7 level is comfortable because although it throws to the nines, but there are not enough of them in the rand, since it is economically unprofitable to play them. Therefore, he often plays against 8 prizes or even in the top.It would seem that in this scenario, it is enough to buy 4 or 7 Prem and calmly farm on it with a high percentage of victories. And now we open a premium store and what we see. At 4 corpses only 1 premier battleship Ichizuchi - absolutely unplayable ship, which is worse than classmates in everything. Battleship without armor, which also removed the range.At level 7 there are 3 destroyers, two cruisers and a German battleship. There are 2 more aircraft carriers, on which the gameplay is very specific. Battleship is not bad, if you do not take into account its 283 mm guns. The destroyers are generally good, but it is understandable that Main players will not choose them. Cruisers I generally believe in this game is garbage.The main vehicles are located at the least comfortable 6 and 8 levels. Playing at 6 you will constantly fall against 8 levels and feel complete impotence. Playing 8 will use you to feed damage to 10 lvls. That is, when buying 8 premi it is necessary not to rejoice, but to grieve, since you will not see any comfortable game on it for a long time.After all the nagging above there is a logical question, why do I recommend this game, whether it is worth it to play at all.The fact is that in my games I first of all are interested in the process of cognition, understanding of game mechanics, choosing the most effective options for gaining an advantage over the enemy. And WOWs all this generously provides.The key parameter is the percentage of wins, it shows how many fights your team has won.And although it may seem that the victory of a team of 12 people does not depend on the efforts of one person, but this is not so.The fact is that playing well and influencing the battle can significantly increase the chance of winning your team and have the status 60+ in a solo game.Here is the implementation of this task and keeps me in the game, makes it interesting for me.How to achieve this task?First of all, one must understand that the current level system is broken and not all classes of ships in this game are equally good. In other words, 95% of the ships are frank garbage.Of those that are even good, many are not suitable for the game because of the uncomfortable level of fighting, for example, 5.6.8 levels are not suitable due to the +2 level of combat. 10 are not suitable because of the negative economy. There are 4, 7 and the ninth levels.On the 4th level, Izyaslav and Isokadze are good ships.In the seventh, almost everything, depending on the style of the game.On the ninth I did not play, but I can highlight Missouri as a prem with good stats, to which one should strive to accumulate free experience in an amount of sky-high 7500000.Regarding the role in battle - the destroyers affect the fight very much, as the meaning of this game is in capturing points and gaining advantages over points.The success of the game depends on whether you can live to the end of the battle, while doing considerable damage and not getting it in response, grabbing the points and not letting the enemy do it.It is of course important to kill, but since the size of the cards is large, you can kill a lot and still lose on points.As a match, I really like the game, it allows you to think, make informed decisions during the battle and enjoy the result.

I stumbled upon it in the Steam store and I have already spent about 16 hours playing this game and show no signs of stopping. Everything I ever envisioned in a battleship game, Wargaming Group Limited have brought to life in this epic WWII naval battle sim.Some of my favourite things about the game:- Realistic graphics- Wide range of war ships- Detailed stats and detail per system (armour, artillery, anti air, etc) per warship- Intuative, easy interface and upgrade system- Mechanics, detail and attention they paid to the realism (within reason)- The era of battleships they chose (WWII)- They really grapsed the clear advantages and disadvantages of each type of warship class- The manner in which you control and use your warship during battles has been well thought out and simple- Short and sweet tutorial videos which take no longer than 30 minutes or so to watch, which enables you to jump into the game quicklyI honestly cannot complain about this game tbh.",Sun Jun 07 17:10:51 EEST 2020,34ec5303-4a14-42b7-8605-4bb28c497369

The environment and story are very grim, which marries beautifully with the tight, fast paced and grisly violence that you commit to for the entire game. It's one of my top 5 games of all time. The music has probably had a large part in forming my tastes as well. Gritty, industrial, fast paced, agressive but also melancholic. I guess that could describe the entire game. Would I call it a masterpiece? Maybe, if you could skip the damn cutscenes. They're not terrible but after having seen them so many times it would be nice to just skip them from time to time. That being said the plot is kind of basic and boring, but the character study of Max Payne is intriguing. He's a man who has been through so much suffering, lost so much, and at this point in life even he doesn't really know why he still gets out of bed every morning. But deep down he knows he wants to do the right thing, even it means wading through the ugly mess that is the world he inhabits. Like every Rockstar Game, it has that amazing attention to detail. Whether it's a gunfight in an exclusive nightclub, or pushing your way through a sunny favela, you really get a sense of depth to this world. The vapid life of the socialites crashing down as gunfire reigns, or the casual fear of gunfire displayed by the inhabitants of the favela who upon seeing you, quickly hide away and shut their windows while the inevitable chaos goes on around them. I'd reccomend this game to anyone who enjoyed the gunplay of GTA 5 or Red Dead, but wanted something a bit tighter and responsive. Also anyone who enjoys a gritty look at the world through the eyes of a man who keeps pushing forward despite not really being able to explain why",Sun Jun 13 15:57:16 EEST 2021,3701cad1-1d0d-4bdb-8839-d5b625753cf1

The second game takes place on a collony, where the worldbuilding is slightly better than the first, more detailed and thought about telling a story. The story is about the same quality but characters got more voicelines, including Isaac the character you play as.nThe Atmosphere however does get downgraded a bit, with a lot more action and sounds that break immersion from the ''silent'' and dark vibe that the first game gives. You dont get moments of almost complete silence where you feel alone, nearly as much as the first game.nnThe part that is the most different from the first game, is the combat. Where the first game spawns enemies in locations where the player can always deal with them, with different weapons or loadouts. Where even if the spaces were small or tight, you always had control over the combat. Deadspace#2 is almost the complete opposite when it comes to combat, and it often drops enemies on top of you, stunning or damaging you in the process. As enemies are predetermined to spawn in certain locations that the player might be at, or in some cases will be at. From enemies dropping on top of you, while in an elevator, or from a ceiling vent. To enemies that pile up at certain locations, making it imposible to fight them unless you are in the right location to do so.nThis often results in taking unpreventable damage, or in some cases being stunlocked and dying. Unless you already know where the enemies will spawn and got the right tactic to counter them, you might not always be able to deal with every encounter and just die because you ''did not know what was comming''. nThis is hugely immersion breaking, especialy on higher dificulties. I would recommend playing the game on normal dificulty, so the combat does not take away from the experience as much.nn[b]The Good[/b]n- Amazing world buildingn- Great Storyn- Great voiceactors/voicelinesn- Good sound designnn[b]Neutral[/b]n- Slightly less atmospheric, due to its setting and sound designn- More action focusedn- DLC are unlocked (some disagreement between EA and Steam) and accessible at the first ingame store even if you have not bought any DLC. It contains every weapon and some armor suits, that might or might not give minor bonuses. This is fun for some, but can break immersion for others.nn[b]The Bad[/b]n- Combat and enemy spawns is a large downgrade from the first game.n- Weapons dont always fire (this might be a bug but a consistent one, or to make the game harder)nn[b]Conclusion/should you buy it?[/b]nDeadspace 2 is a solid game in the series, even with the problems it has in combat. Where the first game was a masterpiece for most players, Deadspace 2 does feel a lot less good, until you compare it to other similar games. The story builds onto the first game realy well, and its worth playing.nIf you loved the first game, then I am sure you will like this game as well. Although I would not recommend playing it on higher dificulties.nIf you liked the first game but are not too sure about other games in this series, buy it at a discount.nPlaytime is about 10-14 hours to complete it",Thu Feb 11 18:58:03 EET 2021,6cbe2f52-a722-4d6e-b286-db2a79cc3b37

War Thunder is literally half the size of this game, and it has hundreds of unique aircraft tanks and maps, and all vehicles handle differently, some have modeled interiors and their armor and piercing is simulated.

The environment and story are very grim, which marries beautifully with the tight, fast paced and grisly violence that you commit to for the entire game. It's one of my top 5 games of all time. The music has probably had a large part in forming my tastes as well. Gritty, industrial, fast paced, agressive but also melancholic. I guess that could describe the entire game. Would I call it a masterpiece? Maybe, if you could skip the damn cutscenes. They're not terrible but after having seen them so many times it would be nice to just skip them from time to time. That being said the plot is kind of basic and boring, but the character study of Max Payne is intriguing. He's a man who has been through so much suffering, lost so much, and at this point in life even he doesn't really know why he still gets out of bed every morning. But deep down he knows he wants to do the right thing, even it means wading through the ugly mess that is the world he inhabits. Like every Rockstar Game, it has that amazing attention to detail. Whether it's a gunfight in an exclusive nightclub, or pushing your way through a sunny favela, you really get a sense of depth to this world. The vapid life of the socialites crashing down as gunfire reigns, or the casual fear of gunfire displayed by the inhabitants of the favela who upon seeing you, quickly hide away and shut their windows while the inevitable chaos goes on around them. I'd reccomend this game to anyone who enjoyed the gunplay of GTA 5 or Red Dead, but wanted something a bit tighter and responsive. Also anyone who enjoys a gritty look at the world through the eyes of a man who keeps pushing forward despite not really being able to explain why",Mon Jan 31 09:08:40 EET 2022,3701cad1-1d0d-4bdb-8839-d5b625753cf1

Other games seem to handle controller reconnection just fine but MHW seems to lack object permanence in this regard which is pretty forgivable since a game and not a sentient being.  However, it does seem  a little weird when you see this exact feature working in so many other games and MHW could almost be expected to be able to do this as well considering it first launched on console and came to PC months afterward.nnHowever, when you compare this shortcoming to something like a Bethesda game and interesting question arises from it... ""What the fuck does Bethesda even do?  Why do I still have to install modpack on modpack to fix bugs that have been in this series since mfing Morrowind??""nnIn conclusion; Monster Hunter World is a great game and if you still need to hear someone tell you that it's worth it to buy it on PC in 2022, then let me be the first to welcome you to owning a PC.  I know, it's probably your first and I'm very excited for you and all of the mods you're going to try to install in Skyrim and Fallout 4, because lets be honest that's the real reason you got a PC.  Don't even deny it, you're just lying to yourself, and there's nothing to be ashamed about.  nnNow go watch some MXR and download all the best mods and play the ""I'm going to mod the absolute shit out of this game just to play it for 2 hours and get bored"" game and then come back to this review, mark it helpful, and then buy and play MHW.

There are some bad reviews regarding that you can't play your old account on steam and what they don't know is that all you have to do is change the Steam file ""Steam_api"" by adding a ""2"" infront of file's name to play with your old account and there some youtube videos in where you can find it and change it.There are four classes of ship Battleships (BB), Carriers (CV), Destroyers (DD), and Cruisers (CL/CA) and there is Premium ships for all four classes of ship. Also if you want to get premium ships they do rotate premium ships by Tech tree refreshers in January and September every year otherwise the other way to obtain them is by limited time sales. Ships like the Arkansas can't be purchased, and OP ships like the Konig Albert and the Nikolai can't be purchased at all.For Carriers I Recommend playing Tier 4-5 carriers first in PvP/PvE and and practicing strafes with fighters and Alt attacks with Strike aircraft in Tier 6 with PvE first before being commited to carriers in PvP. There are youtube videos to help you be a better CV player in the game.When you are in Destroyers and Cruisers and have torpedoes (this also includes battleships with torpedoes) look at your torpedo range first before going into battle and also be careful launching your torpedoes when allies are near as if your not careful by these two things you'll be accidently teamkilling your own team and you'll turn pink at one point playing these ships.Battleships are a classes that relies on their main guns doing all the work and have the armor to soak up damage. AP by fare does more damage than HE, but HE does create more fires. Use AP for broadsides and when the enemy BB is angled bow on towards you use HE unless you are in a Yamato. Not every Battleship has the same armor, take the tier 5 American battleship New York for example, it uses the all or nothing armor concept, to do heavy damage towards all or nothing Battleships in a Battleship hit the area of the aft and stern and between the aft/Stern and citadel to do maxium damage there. When fighting ships like the Bismarck that has the Turtleback armor scheme, it's more difficult getting citadeled at close range but in return it's vulernable to plunding fire. One trick in fighting ships like the bismarck in a battleship is instead of aiming at the waterline aim a little higher towards the upper belt you'll do a more damage there. If in a Cruisers or Destroyer use HE unless you have torpedoes to use against the BB. I don't want to make my review too long, this game is great but it does have it's flaws but I do recommend it.",Wed Oct 06 11:48:46 EEST 2021,35e77cd9-2397-4ef9-8c97-25eff902d1e3

The difference between tiers isn't that much of a quality step. More important is that the tier system is separating the beginners from the more deeply involved (play-time) players, which is a good thing. There are sometimes people not playing 'by the book' and we loose. Sometimes that person is me, othertimes not. It's much about learning to play each class of ship, which have their own role and characteristics. Having someone equally advanced as you by your side is more fun than playing against much easier or much harder opponents.The challenges in this game is, however, not the gear, but the strategy (overall plan) and the tactics (battles). There is an invisible range from enemy ships you should try not to cross too far alone, if so, you will sink before you know it, especially if several ships target you.  Observe the range where others may detect you and the range of your main artillery. Also, keep an eye at the map now and then, to avoid being trapped alone against many.This is a not so social game. After playing almost 200 games, very few has reached out to me with messages.

If you want more frame rates, you can always enable DLSS or FSR to do that without sacrificing too much quality. The mouse and keyboard is fluid enough to play the game, but I would recommend to use a gaming controller instead （Xbox controller should be good enough for most people, as you will not get any PlayStation exclusive feature by using a DualSense controller). nn[b]A side note: If you are using a PlayStation controller, right click God of War in your steam libary and select properties, then go to the controller section, you can disable the steam input there to have proper layouts of the controller. nnA PC with GTX 1060 can run more than 30 FPS with all graphical settings at original level.

I do like the progression sytem now that i understand it more.So should you play?Why not it is free to play! Do not get suckered into buying Premium ships too early learn to play, use the xp and in game credits to research/buy ships that are otherwise free to play, then maybe treat your self when you know what will help you win with your play style, if you still want to buy the shiny ships in store.",Tue Jun 01 02:02:31 EEST 2021,0147c8c1-5f8a-4c75-9260-416b4e8aa674

You know before many conflicts whether you have engaged on superior footing or lesser than your opponent(s). This is because the pace of entering most conflicts(for the observant, and discarding careless play) is very casual and the pace of the combat itself is relaxed. When you are winning or loosing a conflict, you are already reflecting on earlier parts of the conflict - positioning, speed of entry, bearing of your guns, state of your torpedos or repair kits or smoke bombs, the decisions you made to enter the conflict at all based on your vehicle, nearby allies' vehicles, proximity to allies and the enemies, and the types of vehicles the enemies are in. It's a learning experience to loose, and like writing out a trig proof to win. The proofs available are different by every feature of an encounter. You grow your knowledge of the proofs by loosing a specific setup, and thinking about what variables could've been changed to make it either avoidable, escapable, or beatable. You also think about the other side of it - how you could embrace a certain set of variables for an assault, and how you could do it better or support it if an ally attempts it.",Tue Apr 27 01:41:02 EEST 2021,c0c678fc-13ed-4e93-9b14-188c32c9b986

The Ai destroyers are immune to torpedo hits, they phase through the ship but if a player uses one.. torpedo's can hit and almost sink your destroyer immediately. I have watched the Ai, they do a fairly good job of dodging even though they can't be hit in the first place.

Me included. I first played the original Half-Life 2 around 2005, completing Half-Life 1 shortly after. I remember how both Episode One and Episode Two were heavily anticipated and how I myself waited and eventually completed both of them. That was one hell of a journey and I will always remember it. But yet, this journey never got the proper ending for any of us... And yet, up to this day the Half-Life series remain to be legendary FPS games. Valve just nailed everything in them - graphics, music, sound-design, the story, characters and, of course, gameplay. Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 were so ahead of its time being so revolutionary. However, some can argue here that it cannot be applied said also about both episodes. But what's most important about both them, it is the fact that Valve perfected here everything they brought in Half-Life 2. And among both episodes it's Episode Two which actually the pinnacle of the series. And even that Half-Life 3 never came out and we can blame Valve for it as much as we want, it's still worth playing through the series and experience how good they actually are. Especially, this one. It has so amazing and intense combat-mechanics, a breathtaking story, an unic art-direction, as well as super-cool soundtrack. All this makes it one of the best games in the series. And yet, it remains to be one of most epic cliffhangers in videogames history... So, acknowledging all this controversy I still highly recommend you to play it and witness that final adventure of Gordon and Alyx. And with Half-Life Alyx released in 2020, who knows... Maybe the story of Half-Life will continue",Mon Mar 22 02:34:18 EET 2021,2b174648-944d-47f5-ac6c-75e5072058d1

The game runs smoothly on my pc wich is a fairly old and cheap one, looks good, sounds good, plays good and doesnt have many bugs. The gameplay reminds a bit of a moba, but then again, not quite. Also reminds a bit of chess, in real time, where every piece is controlled by one person, but then again, not quite.A standard battle has a 12v12 setup and when you die, you're gone. You either win by killing the other team, or you win by points - you get points from capture points and from kills, and loose points when team mates die. Every match has a limit of 20 minutes but often ends earlier. To be good at the game you mainly need situational awareness, and the ability to plan ahead, as well as accurately see what you opponents will do. It's also a fairly causual experience, there is 7v7 clan battle seasons, but the majority of your games will be ""random battles"" that just throw 12 people up against 12 other people with same classess and tiers of ships. You can group up with friends for these battles, but you are limited to groups of 3 people in each.You certainly can open up your wallet for this game, and you can be a whale too, but i dont think you need too. There are 10 tiers of ships and many ship trees that are all free. You first start with a very basic tier 1, get some experience with that then you get you buy (with in game currencies) the next tier ship in that line and so on. Every new tier introduces more game mechanics so the game gets harder the more you play, as higher tier ships only duke it out with other high tier ships. In the first tiers its +-1 tier, but when you reach tier 5 its +-2 tiers, meaning tiers 5s can be matched up against tier 7s. I see alot of reviews say this is a bad thing, but i dont really think so. Remember, every team has the exact same number of ships with the exact same classess and tiers. If you are a tier 5 destroyer there will be a tier 5 destroyer on the other team also. And a tier 5 ship can defiently outplay any tier 7 ship, you are just in a slightly worse ship. But I do think many players hit a wall at around tier 5 as alot of better players enjoy the mid tiers, and the lower tiers are full of noobs. That combined with more punishing game mechanics the higher you get up the trees could make your first tier 5 a rough experience. If you wanna progress quicker in the trees there is premium account time for sale, which could cost you 10 euros for a month, or less the more time you buy at once. (I just bought 12 months for 40 euros, but that was during a sale). There are also ships outside of the skill trees that are called premium ships, that you can only get from buying them directly. They have their benefits but are overall as good as the free ships, with a couple of exceptions (some premiums are hitting around 55% win rate on average). Over all I would not recommend buying any premiums when you start out, especially high tier ones. If you hop in a high tier ship as a noobie you get paired with others in high tier ships that knows the game and you will get absolutely smashed. So yeah, over all great game. Probably a bit different to what you are used to. It's mostly a mind game, your super quick counter strike reflexes and pin point accuracy wont really help you here.

Using a battleship at range can easily get you ban for many sessions as even if a ships sails in front of your shots it is always your fault. Ships sometimes sail along side you and you can easily shoot them if aiming down the scope which is the majority of the game. I've actedentally run into friendly torpedos yet the game counted it as his fault. I can only imagine how many games he was ban for.

It's a decent game to play around with, though highly annoying even for the full time streamers i see play the game. Biggest con in the game I would say is just how LUCK based it is. Now they will go on and on about their aiming system. But in reality it seems to be extremely luck based. I'll explain a bit. Most of the games i have played i seem to HALO about 90% of the time, while the other team seems to hit me with at least 5 shots of a 6 round burst at least 75% of the time. So the aiming works by creating an oval, the shots all land somewhere in the oval depending on LUCK. Now if you lock onto someone it is supposed to shrink this oval and if you're closer it also shrinks it. Funny thing is it never seems to matter. I have had shipps completely broad side to me and i hit on every ♥♥♥♥ing side but not 1 shot lands on the damn ship. I have had them nose at me and same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Of course shooting a ship coming straight at you should be harder, but when the enemy is attacking me like i said they seem to have about 75% accuracy regardless of the direction im going. Hell even when im playing a destroy class and continuously rotating around theyre hitting with most their shots.Now either 90% of the players are cheating and the creaters aren't doing a damn thing about it. Or their firing system is mostly luck based. However, if you can deal with that bs then you should be fine. I see many big streamers playing this game and they get irritated at how much they halo compaired to other ships too so I know it's not just me. It also seems to have severally increased how good AA is to the point that 1 bombing run of torps or bombers literally killed every one of the jets... And since carriers barely carry any ships (at least to teir 5) it's extremely pointless to even play as a carrier anymore. This can be noticed by how many games I play that are completely without carriers, and how when you are queing up the carrier que is typically at a 0... Kinda sad that you made a class completely pointless, when in real life carriers pretty much own everything. However, even with my negatives the overall fun I have had with this game out weighs the extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ portion to it. I keep playing, though if they fixed the game I would probably put a lot more time into this one over other games.",Fri Jan 21 17:18:20 EET 2022,b8d32182-abef-46fd-9f58-e00ce9620bd5

You need to have some skill to participate in that engine, i.e. if you're not good you won't get the chance to get lucky or unlucky with shots at all and you'll simply miss, but even when you figure out ranging, leading, etc. you'll often find two shots from the same cannon drifting above AND below the target at the SAME TIME! Entire broadsides fired together will somehow fall inches from the target on every side without touching it. And sometimes every shot will hit. Totally up to the drift RNG. But even better, particular locations on the ship are critical hits (called the citadel) if you penetrate the armor. Taking the drift into account, you can aim for them, but outside close range it is, of course, relatively random whether you hit this spot or not. Whether you penetrate the armor or not is, you guessed it, more RNG. But what makes this REALLY great is on top of all that, if it DOES hit the citadel, and if it DOES penetrate the armor, the damage is utterly catastrophic, taking off up to 50% of your health per shell. Not a battleship shell to a destroyer. A battleship shell to a battleship. Same weight class. 50%. Gone. Just like that. Completely. At. Random.But what's even MORE fun? On top of all that, there is a tiny, tiny percentage chance that any given shot will hit your magazine. So more RNG for more massive damage.The practical upshot of all this is while there is a significant amount of skill involved, and the chances of it happening to you at any given time are low, you can (and do) intermittently just explode for no reason. You can be winning a duel by a LOT and then a lucky, single shell, fired as a parting shot from a fleeing foe with a broken rudder and a burning deck, will completely obliterate you.So to be completely fair, that doesn't happen much. But it does happen, and when it does it's pretty much the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ever. Basic citadel hits, which are far more common, are still pretty obnoxious, as there's little you can do about them.So basically, skill is involved, but not really the ultimate deciding factor. If you enjoy randomly exploding, play this game. If you don't... Well, if you're really into ships then give it a try for the good looking models and see for yourself. But if you're not into ships, just give it a pass. It's not a good enough game to reccomend to anybody who isn't a Pacific Theatre nerd.

When i downloaded it through steam it kept saying your game does not match the server version. I had to download the war games launcher from the game website, then link the launcher game folder to the steam game folder and splice the files. It took me a few days to figure that out. If i launch it through steam It brings me to a different profile not the wargames one. So that is why i only have .7 hours, although I do only have about 5 or 6 anyway. So far I would say it is fun, but my highest ship is tier 3, I'm like a thousand exp away from 4. I was pushing my way to a carrier but after seeing other reviews i am rethinking that decision. So far this is way less frustrating than world of tanks and warthunder. A lot less dying and it at least seems that the matches are mostly balanced. I hated when in world of tanks you would roll out then immediately get one shot by a premium tank three tiers higher than you with a bunch of premium buffs. I am sure I am going to hit a pay wall quite soon, but the game does seem nice enough where I am actually considering buying something. Probably when i hit the inevitable pay wall round tier 6. Over all I'd say give it a try. Just hide your wallet for a while because the options to buy are shoved in your fave and are quite tempting. It is quite fun in lower tiers so just play it till it pisses you off then uninstall, worked for world of tanks and all the games like this.",Tue Oct 08 07:54:22 EEST 2019,8b5282eb-1b08-4132-9103-84124ffcc39a

So thus leading you to play mostly in that lovley Co Op area until you can get a friend to play with or find one in game...but then again it's a free to play game so you'll find mostly children or the mental equivilent of a child when you need to have at least some tactical awareness in this VERY SLOW PACED game that heats up VERY QUICKLY only to end sometimes too fast or not fast enough...rarely do I ever find a truly Fun round.I can also just see the responses from those who defend this game religiously because they paid money for a ship and got ripped off thus they feel obligated to defend their 'investment' hahahahahahahIf anyone wants a quick idea of how much Real World money they want for a ship, the USS Arizona (BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST WELL REKNOWN SHIPS ON THE PLANET EARTH) is a tier 6 (maybe 7 I can't recall right now) and is a superior version to the it's counterpart that you can earn in game without needing real money. I first looked in to the price of it expecting maybe a $20 price tag perhaps pushing $30....OH NO! First you have to buy the in game currency which is only sold in certain bundles of ammounts and then you can spend that currency on the ship, also you don't get ANY REFUNDS once you buy this in game currency even if you don't use it. Well to wrap it up they wanted me to buy either a $60 bundle to have enough of the in game currency to just buy the USS Arizona however it would leave me with some extra that I have no use or desire for at all, I don't even want a spare crate or an extra ship slot at all just the ship....but no I have to over spend just to get what I want. Or I can spend around $45 on a few seperate bundles to get...yet again...just a few extra in game currency bits that I DON'T WANT. It's very kind of them to try and help you spend your money for you!Oh yeah don't forget that ALL of the purchaseable ships (Real World Money that is) are given so many extra buffs that a standard free to play player CAN NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO that don't only give some aid to the player who bought the ship as way of thanking them for the purchase (which I can understand) but they also give them in game advantages against you and your abilites making you a less lethal opponent...and they spent money to get that buff...I believe that's called PAY TO WIN.

Go to the directory it downloaded and delete steam_api.dll3. Open the game (if you had the standalone version, move the preferences.xml file to the directory so you get the login and config automatically)4. Log in and enjoy playing thru SteamHere is the thing, doing this WILL NOT allow you to pay with Steam currency, so you got to buy stuffs with direct purchases inside the game; if they release achievements YOU WILL NOT be able to get them (you can always use SAM to unlock those achievements, keep in mind, it's not fair nor ""legal"", do it at your own risk)So, why would you do this? You can do this to play your old account, while keeping the Steam overlay without any issue (adding the standalone version may cause some issues), have access to the community inside Steam, easier to have screenshots and share them, KEEP THE GAME UPDATED AUTOMATICALLYIf, in the future, they add Steam Trading cards, YOU WILL NOT, be able to get them, since this is a F2P game you need to spend money in their shop to get them...

Before I begin this review, I feel like I should mention that, even though the PC version is definitely the best version of the game, setting this game up to work correctly on modern PCs is a real drag. Physical copies of the game flat-out do not work at all if you run Windows Vista or later, and there's no patch or workaround to fix it. You have no choice but to buy and download the game from Steam, and even though the game runs super well, the game's audio files, aside from the sound effects, were completely broken, so you'll have to download a fanmade patch to get the music and voiceovers audible. I don't want to sound whiny, but you have to understand it's situations like this that make me hesitant to buy more titles on PC. If I buy a game, it should run correctly right out of the gate, I shouldn't have to spend three hours looking for fixes and downloading patches and .rar file extractors for the sake of one game, even if said game is better than the aforementioned PlayStation games.nnWith my little rant out of the way, Max Payne is to film noir what Metal Gear Solid is to war titles. Max Payne not only has a dry, brilliant sense of humor, with hilarious jokes and references to hard-boiled detective movies and media, but it's also, on its own, a great crime story. Unlike Metal Gear Solid, the plot isn't exactly unique: if anything, every single cliche and trope associated with police dramas is present and hammed up to oblivion, but that's kind of the point. This game is not a comedy, by any means, but it is completely aware the story its telling has been done over and over so many times, it just revels in its cliches.nnThat's not to say its cliches are ineffective in any stretch of the imagination. Similarly to Batman, Max Payne's main goal is looking for revenge against a drug smuggler who murdered his family. It's just in this case, instead of his parents, it's his wife and newborn daughter. The first thing we see in this game is the aftermath in shockingly raw detail. It's honestly incredibly discomforting, and the sounds of that horrible crime haunt the game in a number of later levels. Max Payne, while he is a fugitive cop with little in the way of morals, he's still an incredibly likable character. He not only has incredibly cool moves when he fires away at criminals, as well as a permanently smug facial expression, but watching his interactions with people and hearing his inner thoughts make him such a funny and likable guy through and through. He's kinda like Marvel's the Punisher, but with 100% self-awareness.nnThe graphics and sound design in this game are absolutely incredible and would've been impossible to emulate on a PlayStation. From what I hear, the PlayStation 2 could barely handle it. While the static photorealistic faces are impossible to take seriously, seeing New York in the middle of a blizzard with millions of snowflakes falling individually in the background looks amazing. Even little details, like the individual bullets that fall whenever Max or any of the thugs fire their weapons look amazing. The game's story is mostly told through graphic novel-style cutscenes, which look amazing. The voice acting is also fantastic, especially James McCaffrey's melancholy yet sarcastic portrayal of Max Payne. Hearing him say corny lines with a completely serious tone is what really sells a lot of the game's humor.nnThe gameplay is structured to feel like you're playing an action movie similar to The Matrix, and it succeeds in every level imaginable. The bullet time mechanic in particular is a pretty ingenious mechanic that I really wouldn't mind seeing in more games. When you press the left Shift key, time slows down for a temporary period, making it easier for Max to aim and fire at his foes. It also makes it easier to dodge incoming bullets. You have a wide selection of guns and weapons to choose from, and no matter how many characters are onscreen at once firing away, the framerate never hiccupped once, and I didn't notice any clipping or tearing.nnMax Payne is the best game I have reviewed so far, hands down. It features fantastic atmosphere, a unique spin on a cliched story, and easily the best voice acting I have heard in a game so far. I honestly cannot wait to check out the sequels. While I still absolutely adore The Fifth Element and Metal Gear Solid, this game just feels like a huge jump from those two in terms of having better aesthetics and a tremendously better balance between story and gameplay",Mon Sep 27 05:06:43 EEST 2021,8c900cde-9fc0-415b-9db3-2f1c3cf65d27

I had a few friends who had already beat base world before I bought the game at their recommendation. This game is very welcoming to series newcomers and was an absolute blast to play both solo and with friends. I am amazed by the lack of toxicity I have encountered while playing and happily beat both world and iceborne. With friends this game is nothing but a good time. On your own it is still a fun experience that gets the adrenaline pumping while still providing a challenge that hooked me to the franchise for years to come.nnThe only negatives I can give are the connection errors in multiplayer and that, if doing a hunt for the first time, YOU are required to watch an in-game cut scene before other players can join the hunt. The lack of scaling for both 3 and 4 players as opposed to 3-4 being combined also sucked when I had two friends online and we knew that we would be fighting a monster that was scaled for four people. nnOverall, if you are thinking about trying out Monster Hunter then world and iceborne is probably the best place to start at square one",Mon Mar 29 16:41:12 EEST 2021,045268e5-9648-4a3c-9685-02fbe3a8f837

Frustration of the grind to get into something with more armor than a tin can in order to reach a level of any sort of meaningful tactical gameplay not worth the effort to me.  The core game mechanic of losing to people with bigger ships than you until you can get into a bigger ship to do anything useful may work as an incentive to keep some people playing but for me it does quite the opposite.

Ships from 20 years apart are forced to fight each other with enormous imbalances and a tier 5 will face tier 7s every other match.High tier gameplay is mostly boring campfests at long range because moving close gets someone instantly focused on the wide open maps.Aircraft carriers are both boring to play (like the world's worst RTS game) but also game-breakingly overpowered, with infinite fuel planes that launch 30 in 10 seconds (unlike a real carrier where it would take hours to get every single plane out of the hangar, moved up on deck and launched one at a time.) Because of the joke matchmaking, an aircraft carrier can fight a 1910 ship that does 0 DPS to airplanes because it got time-traveled by the terrible russian developer. Airplanes can drop torpedoes from solid cliff faces or 1 inch of water and there are no water-tight compartments on ships in-game, so a ship that could float without the nose and without the rear in real life will auto-die to 1 tiny section flooding with water after extinguishing a fire. Carriers average the damage of 3-4 combat ships but can stay hidden in spawn behind a cliff all game long with no risk.It's okay to play free, but do not expect the company to improve the game. They haven't made CVs either realistic or balanced in several years of being out.",Wed Feb 17 04:15:39 EET 2021,82736a5c-f7eb-4a4d-a62a-4213e76c4d5c

Only worth buying if you want another rehash of the same formula and don't expect much.nnThe first and sadly, for me at least, only positive aspect of this game were the absolutely gorgeous graphics. It's quite impressive how much visual fidelity has improved in a mere five years, and the performance is good as well.nOtherwise though, I really didn't enjoy 'Shadow'. Aside from a few new climbing mechanics it's basically the same game as the last two, but they somehow managed to make everything feel worse.nFor one, not only is the story forgettable, which is to be expected, the narration (the overall way in which the story is conveyed), which was excellent in the first 'Tomb Raider', is complete garbage here. Like in many blockbuster movies, things happen more or less randomly all over the place without any coherence or emotional urgency and even though the scope is supposed to be grander, it never feels like there is much at stake without any personal investment from Lara, who is really just a tourist who happens to be nearby when the locals do things. The completely unnecessary side-quests added for padding are also insultingly nonsensical, such as when a guy from an isolated village in the middle of the jungle asks Lara to find an artifact the queen tasked him to acquire as proof of his worth, because he 'doesn't have the time'. This might be par for the course in MMOs, but at least a little better should be expected from a story-focused first-person game such as this, especially when between the many lengthy (often unskippable) cutscenes and annoyingly long animations for everything from sitting down at a fire to wiggling through a crevice during which you lose control of Lara, large portions of the game are non-gameplay.nCombat encounters have also been trimmed significantly, both overall and in terms of number of enemies, which leaves puzzles and traversal for the majority of what you actually do. While there are fewer, but much larger world areas, both mandatory as well as optional puzzles (crypts and tombs, which are much more hidden and out of the way now), are more numerous and notably larger than before.nnNow, the reason I didn't enjoy these activities in 'Shadow' may be considered questionable, since it is unfortunately related to the (still fantastic) graphical quality and environmental design, which makes gameplay conflict jarringly with appearance. Thanks to expansive vistas and excessive (but realistic) amounts of clutter everywhere, areas seem much less linear than they actually are. On the surface, this might sound nice, and could have been an improvement if it didn't actually reduce player freedom by preventing you from going anywhere you are not absolutely supposed to go. In the first 'Tomb Raider', the area borders were very obvious, which is admittedly clunky, but in exchange everything inside was traversible, whereas in 'Shadow' you can't even jump on the roofs of houses. Moreover, I found this made figuring out where you are allowed to go very frustrating, because a large portion of areas that really should be accessible actually aren't. You have to jump/grab/aim in/at the exact right place or it won't work and even then Lara is often moved in mid-air as if pulled by a magnet. This can go so far that you cannot even shoot an enemy from a position you are not supposed to be in for that encounter.nThink you can jump this knee-high fence? Nope. Walk on that log directly in front of you to cross the gap? Slip off and fall. Need to go around. Lower yourself to that clearly visible ledge? Nope, was just part of the scenery, not walkable terrain. Drop down to the bridge maybe three meters below? Instant death. Even though it will be safe to walk on later when you go there the 'right way'. Instead jump five meters backwards while hanging from a wall to an area that didn't look accessible. Similarly, puzzles have to be solved in the one intended way, even if there is an easier and more obvious solution that should plausibly work (barring glitches of course).nnIn conclusion, I simply didn't enjoy it and that's all that counts in the end",Fri Oct 01 01:46:59 EEST 2021,33fc9839-7e2d-411e-9f82-2cc8582bcef1

This is a good game if you like casually blowing stuff up while intoxicated, or you really like boats, or you found World of Tanks too fast-paced. But if you're expecting a polished product? No. Interface is extremely clunky, game mechanics are completely non-competitive, and controls do not work as intended.Controls feel really clunky compared to Navy Field, Stellar Impact, and Hyperbol. Turrets cannot be grouped or toggled and the controls are unresponsive. No matter how hard you try to master the controls, the keyboard has been nerfed to be on-par with the console controller. This plays like the PC port of a console game.And why is the scatter so bad? I've played cardgames with less RNG (randomness). I'd heard that the random accuracy and nerfed torpedoes and nerfed aircraft were bad, but making accuracy nonexistent at close ranges?? Real life shells can't have that much spread or they wouldn't make it through the artillery's barrel! If you don't want your shots careening off at random 30° tangents then... Good luck.Queueing up an ammo switch reloads ALL guns after ONE gun fires a shot, instead of queueing each reload individually. Turret rotation fights against the player and EVERY turret turns so slowly that any turret out of line of sight is actively working to sabotage the player's damage output. The mouse cursor rotates all turrets at once, shift-X rotates all turrets at once, P does not disable turret rotation, and there is no way to select turrets or group your turrets. The only way to disable your turrets is by aiming outside their turn radius, or by frustratedly trying to fire while turning, because quickly turning your ship and turrets in opposite directions will prevent them from firing! (Even if you hold down the mouse for sequential fire.) Remember not to ammo swap, because it puts ALL turrets on cooldown!Allied bots will actively torpedo you, and the vast majority of your teammates in PvP will be bots, because matchmaking is newwwbie-friendly ;) and to be extra redundant, if you want to tryhard and play aircraft carrier then you're not allowed to manually control your aircraft (at tiers 4 & 5) because god-forbid having RESPONSIVE CONTROLS THAT LET YOU OUTPLAY YOUR OPPONENT!Locking turret rotation, normalizing the projectile spread at short range, and debugging sequential fire & reloading - these would make the game somewhat immersive. But it feels like every single match is a fight against MY ship to try and get the same level of control that I had in EVERY OTHER SINGLE NAVAL GAME SINCE 2006! This is a CONSOLE game for CONSOLE controllers and if you play on keyboard - TOOOO bad!",Sun Apr 05 18:45:32 EEST 2020,ab4de8cb-1e79-4b1f-9ae5-141c93e46530

I'll do it in Bullet form so it's Easier to find.COMBAT-Everyship has a Role to play. Carriers are there to Dominate the Air and Provide extra Means to sink/Spot Enemies. Battleships are the Tanks. Large HP and can deal massive amounts of Damage when your Main Battaries find their Mark. Cruisers provide Support Fire and help Defend the Larger Ships from Air Attacks. Destroyers are both Amazing and Annoying. Their Torpedoes can destroy a Ship in seconds, which both Benifits and Hurts you. If you see Torpedoes heading torwards you, either try to avoid them or pray they don't cause too much Damage. You have to Lead your Shots, failing to do so will result in a Wasted Shots. But combat seems Fair and has some Stratigy to it.So, now the Grind. Early on you'll notice that Ship's XP Requirement getls High, and I mean HIGH! Like a few days for one Ship kind of High. It wouldn't be so bad if they allowed Ship XP to be shared between Ships, basically negating Free XP (That can be shared but little is aquired). Also, you can't just start out with a Battleship, no you gotta work your way up, From Cruisers to Battleships, Battleships to Carriers. It is a bloosy Grind. My Suggestion? Go Player Versus Player, Yah you get some Coward Tactics but you get a lot more Bang for your Buck. Also, have 2-3 of the Same Ship. That way if you sink in Battle, you can still use another ship to get XP and since they are the same XP is stored on Each one for all use.Next... every Gamer's most HATED 2 Words... MICRO TRANSACTIONS!!!! Now, I hate EA with a Burning Passion.... but at least they don't charge you $60 for a f***ing Premium Ship! A Unique Tier 7 Battleship will cost around 12,000 Dubloons, which can cost you at least $60 just to buy a package. That is asinine. Add to the fact it NEVER is a High Tier 10 Ship, meaning it's the Best Ship for that Catagory/Nation. Since most ""Premium Ships"" are Tier 7-+, that means they aren't even the Strongest by Default.

Disregard any reviews that have less than 100 hours as they honestly haven't learned the game yet. It will take a lot of time to get the aiming in this game down, as every ships guns have different shell velocity or ""bullet speed"" and you will almost always have to lead your target. There is a lot of important information that the game doesn't tell you and this creates a learning curve that confuses and scares off a lot of people. You are almost certainly going to have to learn the mechanics via the wiki or online forums, but it is worth the time invested. There is a very long grind to get to a tier 10 ship (ships tiers range from 1-10 and the higher the tier the stronger the ship essentially) but it makes it that much more rewarding to get a t10. It took me around 100 hours to get my first t10 and it will take you more or less time depending on how quickly you learn the game and if your willing to shell out for premium.That brings us to the way the game is monetized. This game is free to play but has a subscription in the form of ""premium status"". All premium status does is give you a 50% boost to exp earned after each game as well as a credits earned boost. 50% is a huge boost yes, but you can most certainly play and progress without it. You also can get free premium status through events and the weekly operation. If you 5 star the weekly operation it will give you 24 hours of premium. So if you are free to play try and grind hard when you get that free day of premium every so often.There are also premium ships in this game that can be bought with real money. What most people don't mention though is that these are just slightly different versions of free-to-play ships that are better in some areas and worse in others. Also  premium ships only go up to tier 8. You can not directly buy any ship above tier 8 and you can't progress to higher tiers by playing them. This basically means that at the highest levels of play (tier 10) you arent going to see any premium ships. And if you do see them then they are at a huge disadvantage, as they are gonna be 2 tiers under you.I very much suggest atleast trying this game if you are interested. But do note, that you are gonna need a friend to help you along or you are gonna be in for some reading online.",Fri Jun 04 19:08:07 EEST 2021,2da67490-1b13-4c48-be1f-607aded3bbe2

I would recommend using this patch - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451nn[h1] Looks and sound [/h1] nThis Game has not aged well in terms of graphics. The lighting is fine but the textures are pretty old and there was never anything striking about the art direction. In general I find that 3D games don't age well. I do like the way the game mixed the traditional CRPG gameplay with an action-RPG control scheme and letting the player look around the area instead of always being in the isometric perspective.nnThe soundtrack though has stood the test of time for me. It was composed by Inon Zur who is known for his work on the Fallout games and Pathfinder Kingmaker. The music fits well with the general tone of the game and there's a good variety of combat music to stop it from feeling stale.nn[h1] Combat [/h1] nI've played a bunch of games with RTWP in the past few years and I think this is so far my favorite one. I'm not sure what about it made me enjoy it more than Pillars or Pathfinder. It could be how the character progression and subclasses are easier to grasp while still carrying a good amount of variety or the fact that I don't have to rest after fights for spell uses. I played a mage and this game pretty much exemplifies the trope of 'linear warriors and quadrilateral wizards'. I felt exceptionally limited at the start compared to my party members but by the end I was drowning in variety and versatility. This game has a lot of sublasses, called specializations and they can change your build a lot. I mostly played a traditional wizard for the player character but I had a fighter-templer, a shapeshifter-wizard and a healer-wizard which gave a lot of choices in how to tweak my party setup.nnThe game is surprisingly well balanced for the most part other than one fight in the main questline. Even the optional bosses which looked harder weren't too much for a new player like me to handle on normal difficulty.nn[h1]Story and Worldbuilding[/h1]nThe story follows a Grey Warden who has to stop a horde of evil creatures, the darkspawn from taking over the nation of Ferelden. The quests mostly have the player going to different locations and convincing the local leaders to assist the grey wardens in fighting the threat. It's a simple but effective message of how some squabbles can be meaningless in the face of a threat which requires mass co-operation. Each leader is facing their own set of issues and is located in a separate part of the map where there a lot of different questlines set up. There's a pretty good variety of choices with different outcomes which can be affected by one's race, build and stats.nnThe companions of this game range from a knight Templar grey warden, a shapeshifter rogue mage, a failed assassin, a healer mage, a warrior from a vastly different culture and some others. There's a good enough variety in terms of character and classes for companions. DAO manages to keep companions active in the game by having them react to your decisions with positive or negative reputations along with personal questlines which often depend on those reputations.nnThe Worldbuilding of Dragon Age takes inspiration from the Blight of the Wheel of Time and Morder from Lord of the Rings but it's not a simple copy paste. There's a surprising amount of thought and detail behind the darkspawn in the setting and how the Grey Wardens are entwined with them. In general it feels like the writers really asked the logical questions to introducing certain concepts and then applied that to the world. This sounds simple but requires a lot of planning and it's really satisfying to see how everything sort of clicks and makes sense. The way mages are treated and behave is one such example. It makes sense that people with such destructive potential who are also prone to being possessed would be feared and reviled while at the same time needed for certain purposes.nnnOverall I recommend this game to anyone who likes story based fantasy games, is looking to get into CRPGs or wanting to try RTWP(real time with pause) gameplay.nnI will be making a seperate review for the Awakening DLC which I think is massive enough to warrant a seperate version but the short version would be that it's good and you should get it too or just get the ultimate edition",Sun Jan 30 09:48:13 EET 2022,34dc6468-23d7-415f-8f56-ba9ed586daef

[/h1]nnNot by any means a prequel to Old Blood, not to The Colosseus games but it's just another one of Captain Blazko's crazy adventures, filled with bulletstorms, chaos, tears, blood and depression. nnOnce again you're put into the Nazi-hating shoes of Captain Blazkowicz, who begins this adventure by assaulting a compound said to hold the Masterpiece behind the world's invasion by the Nazi forces; Commander Deathshead. Ironically, Blazkowicz loses the battle, Deathshead emmerges victorious and the whole world submits into becoming a Nazi colony. One of two of Blazko's best men-at-arms is experimented on by Deathshead and dies while Blazko himself gets shrapnel inside his head and he's hospitalized in an asylum, where he meets Anya, the love of his life. Together they must go on a perilous journey to save the world from Deathshead's insane control.nnThe very amazing thing about this game is that you get to choose who is dissected by Deathshead at the beginning of the game, which will allow for two timelines: One where Private Wyatt is alive and the other where Captain Fergus is... Each timeline is different than the other; Wyatt teaches you how to lockpick, which will allow you to find very peculiar armor upgrades while Fergus allows you to disable doors, which will allow you to locate health upgrades respectively. There are other differences to the two timelines (that's why I highly suggest you play the whole game twice); in Wyatt's timeline, you meet with J, a musician at headquarters with a story that will fill your heart with sadness. In Fergus' timeline, you will meet with Tekla, a mastermind who will learn by the end that life is not all a field of probabilities, and much like Blazko's friendship to her, some things will happen without reason and without warning. nnThat's about it for the story... or should I say the ""STORIES""! You also meet a wonderful cast of characters; like the very iconically malicious duo Frau Engel and her assistant Hans ""Bubi"" as well as some of my personally beloved characters, like Max, J and Caroline. All in all the game is quite immersive, with some moments that will fill your heart with terror as well as others that will release on you true fear.nnNow onto the chaos; gameplay-wise the game is amazingly well-handled. The graphics are top-tier and the weapon play is gorgeous (you can dual-wield snipers on this one lol). Not everything you come across is breakable, obviously, but using the torchgun is quite satisfying to open up secret areas. One thing that I found missing from The Old Blood was the beds that let you travel to 3D Wolfenstein Games Maps (you can only find the one at headquarters). Voice-acting is great and everything just merges-in harmoniously to provide for you the ultimate FPS shooter experience. There are also perks to unlock that will allow you to hold more ammunition and deal more damage with certain weapons.nnThe game is great as a Single-Player FPS; however, the modes from TOB make quite a scarce appearance as you'll have to find collectibles to unlock only a handful of them, which cuts playtime shorter. Still, the game is absolutely gorgeous and it's something any Gamer should buy! It's a 9.9/10 game with a solid story, solid character development and insanely malificient villains that will give Hitler a run for his money",Sat May 01 13:19:03 EEST 2021,622bc6ce-ad15-4b80-9f2d-96492afbb8ff

And enemies take 3 shotgun shots from point blank range to die. It's just a huge inconsistency of how enemies die from getting shot they could take two bullets sometimes fifty.nBut all and all despite being a game that is old AF I still recommend it to everyone who loves nostalgia.

The soundtrack is captivating enough, following the line of this type of games; and the DLCs are both enjoyable, Legacy coming off as the winner between the two of them.nnCharacters are interesting as usual, their banter always a refreshing element to every quest, but it’s sad that you can only interact with them in specific areas. In addition, the incorporation of a dialogue options wheel, which details the nature of your comment, as well as determine your personality, was a nice enough change. But the fact that what you chose to say and what you actually say are not the same thing, was not always pleasant.nnThe world feels… small, but not because of the maps themselves, but rather due to the fact that they are reused in each act; so it gets kind of tedious to reexplore (twice) an area you already knew. Graphic-wise the game is certainly an improvement, which was to be expected, but it´s appreciated none the less. Darkspawn, Qunari and armor redesign, are especially noteworthy.nnThe combat’s fast pace and smooth animations are another point in its favor; however, characters are not very strong on their own, which makes you rely too heavily on cross-class combos. Equipment restrictions, no race options and far fewer talents are other turnoffs but not total deal-breakers. nnThere are less epilogue options, but I do believe the game is worth replaying at least once in order to experience everything it has to offer, even more so if you decide to add in a few mods.nnTLDRnOverall, it’s a game you can definitely enjoy, despite not being in the same league as its predecessor.

It can be a nice enough introduction to new players, as well as bring a few hours of entertainment to those who are looking to replay/complete the franchise",Sun Jun 21 13:55:52 EEST 2020,42e92dbd-2dbf-4e8e-a86c-b123e4eeb65a

I didn't have it as a kid. I had Quake 1, Quake 3 and a demo of Quake 4. I first played Quake 2 sometime in late 2000s using some sourceport that ""enhanced"" graphics. I didn't like it much. My biggest problems with it were the brown/orange graphics and the constantly intense rock music as soundtrack, when the game is not always intense. In fact, just like Quake 1, it is somewhat methodical compared to Doom 1 and 2. Also the level design is not as good, so often you will be backtracking through empty rooms, and at these moments that intense soundtrack can really get on your nerves.nnPlaying the game now on Software Mode with no soundtrack, I'm actually enjoying it quite a lot. I genuinely love graphics in this mode. Textures are pixelated, but sharp, this gives the game its own style (and resembles Quake 1 to a degree). Now the game actually feels quite atmospheric. Without music, I found the game more immersive. I think the original soundtrack didn't fit the game at all. The game is pretty slow and suspensful with occasional ambushes by crowds. For the most part you meet 2-3 opponents at a time, and you're always on edge, because they're all formidable foes. Though this game loves cheap enemy placements. Anyway, as you discover various alien technology and captured human soldiers who are suffering and begging you to kill them, without that intense soundtrack these scenes work much better.nnAlso, I love the double-barreled shotgun and hate the machine gun here",Sun Aug 09 20:19:28 EEST 2020,126b72c8-fe71-48a5-8a10-fa05a1ac6ce9

In its current state, it needs way too much work to be worth your time and money. I've been playing the game since the closed beta, and have well over 2500 battles since the closed beta reset. [EDIT] [I'm coming back to this review to address developer responses and update based on the current state of the game. I plan to do this every 3-6 months. An edit will appear in brackets. as of February 2018, many of my original points still stand, but I wanted to address the developer comments as well because the developers argue against my review.]Let’s start with the good:+Arcade battles allow for quick play, and make it constant action+The gameplay itself is rather fun, and the progression through the lines gives you a sense of accomplishment and goals+When a battle is well-balanced vertically and horizontally, the results make for a fun and engaging battle where while every team member counts, you can sway the battle in your favor by good play.        +[The developers, after learning the hard way multiple times, are starting to engage with the community in a positive manner, instead of constantly arguing every point (if you are confused, see the response below.]However, these positives are overshadowed by the glaring flaws in the game:-Poor client optimization: I have a rather good computer, and the game constantly hangs and eats up an inordinate amount of power for comparatively mediocre graphics [2/18 The developers can of course disagree, but that doesn't make them right. I have an extremely good processor and a top-of-the-line graphics card. This computer can run VR without flinching. This computer can run ARK at 50-60 fps at 4K and max graphics. This game runs WoWs competitor WarThunder without a hitch. Warframe runs extremely well at 4K (with its plethora of particle effects and much more going on screen) and looks beautiful. Meanwhile, this game constantly hitches and completely lags out while in a menu or when you try to switch out a component on your ship. While the actual gameplay doesn't lag too much, the menu is unbearable, and you feel as though I'm dragging the game to play it in the menus. Something needs to give, whether it is a full engine upgrade, or a simple optimization of code (maybe not having to do a server call every time one presses a button in port)]-Steam is for new users only (while this is a minor complaint, it’s a giant middle finger to those who’ve played since closed beta and gets me to my last point) [2/18 While the developers have voiced their opinion and are not going to revisit it, it still is a flaw in the game. And yes, adding features and flags that are only for new players through steam that older, dedicated players cannot get is insulting to those players, and shows the value the developers place on older players.]-Ridiculous Price model puts “premium ships” around $25-$30 USD for a handful of pixels (and that is on the lower end) [2/18 Once again, though the developers ""have stated it many times before"", newer players should know that the premium ships are generally expensive. If the developers do not want to lower the price, that is their perrogative, but it might be a barrier to entry]-Premium accounts are about the only way to make your investment back at the highest tiers unless you have consistently great games (which you won’t) [2/18 Without a premium account, you can easily lose 100k-200k credits if you have a not-so-great game in a tier X ship, which discourages you from bringing them out and having fun in hitting the capstone in a ship line.]-And why yes, premium ships are overpowered, making the game unbalanced[2/18 Balancing a game is difficult, yes. And while I do admire the developers for not nerfing ships people paid money for, it does create problems. Recently, some ships like the Belfast were offered a refund because of a significant mechanic change. However, it does make things like ranked play difficult if there is an overpowered ship in the tier, because you can count on it being in your match. To be fair, the community does a lot of screeching if a preview of a premium is underpowered, but that is actually a better situation to introduce them underpowered rather than have an OP ship be untouchable.]Which brings me to the ugly:-The aircraft carriers (CVs) are completely out of whack, ruin the rock-paper-scissors balancing, and that one ship can ruin the entire match (There is a reason why carriers revolutionized naval warfare, and the game promotes a pre-carrier battle with aircraft carriers). If you CV captain forgot his brain at home, you will likely get blown up by the enemy CV, as there is little you can do to defend against enemy planes. [2/18 Grouping will likely not save you, unless you are in a clan match with a highly coordinated team. All you are left to do is either pray that there is no CV, or throw a bunch of AA on your ship, thereby gimping it and making it a problem. The AA spec everything is also not fun for the CV, as he just has to sit there and do almost nothing all game. Being a total wash should not depend on the grace of the matchmaker, but rather the skill of the team.]-Horizontal imbalance: ships from the same tier, but different nations are astoundingly out of whack.  [2/18 Once again, balancing is hard, but constantly throwing new mechanics in new ship/national lines makes your job more difficult.]-The power creep is real, and recently released ships pound their predecessors into the water. [2/18 Considering that a certain RN tier X BB nerf is in the works, the developers might be getting a bit more sensitive to this.]-Vertical imbalance: You will get overmatched in a battle, up to two tiers. A tier V battleship cannot take a tier VII battleship on a tier VII map. You end up either slow and irrelevant or blown to bits in one of the faster ships. [2/18 While Steam provided a slight increase in player base, it did not provide enough to alleviate the problem in middle tiers. Those players likely quit out of frustration, and might be lost to the void, leaving WoWs right at square one.]-Developer attitudes to player base are adversarial: they bully critical streamers into avoiding negative reviews, and are only remorseful when they are caught and the community backlash forces them to apologize. I’ve seen more customer cooperation from my internet provider and most US airlines. [2/18 This is a bit on the mend. Wargaming has avoided sticking their foot in it since November (an improvement in and of itself.) The developers and community outreach has been much more active on Reddit and their forums with Sub_Octavian. Further, Wargaming seems to have become more receptive to player feedback and are working on improvements. However, based on the developer responses (from November, so they might have improved) some old habits die hard, and instead of saying ""We're sorry you had problems, and thank you for giving us suggestions."" or ""While we know we have problems in our game, we are working to correct them."" we have a point-by-point argument or simple contradiction rather than an attempt at reconciliation. This is indicative of the attitude that can kill so many great games.]While I really enjoy this game, I can’t support it in its current form with its current development team. At such a high cost for its premium content, the flaws should have been fixed a year ago. It has a great base mechanic, but not having the support it deserves drives players like me away. I hope to someday give it a good review, but that is not today.[2/18 Unfortunately, there hasn't been enough improvement to the game for me to recommend it. Where there has been improvement, it has not been remarkable enough to change my attitude towards WoWs. I want to give this game a positive review, because there is so much potential, but  it is so frustrating to watch it get squandered.",Mon Jul 19 08:33:00 EEST 2021,77a22b2c-a6ce-47a1-85d6-af6a55ed671b

It greatly improved upon the game in every aspect with refined gunplay, a higher budget to improve the story, acting, the classic comic book cutscenes, and more advanced AI. It still keeps all of the core elements that made Max Payne so good by creating a depressing Noire York that now has constant rain instead of the snow in the last game. The story is also much more complex than the original's plot furthering this by allowing you to take control of Mona Sax who is a more integral part of the plot. Also the attention to detail in this game was crazy for the time allowing you to interact with a wide array of objects around you and putting you in a much more destructible environment. Max Payne 2 still holds up very well today unlike Max Payne which needed a lot more work to patch it up and still had issues with getting stuck on geometry. Max Payne two isn't without issues though, having to be completely fixed to run (which you can solve by altering the files after looking up a video), tedious levels like the one with Vinnie Gognitti in the Captain Baseball Bat Boy costume and him getting stuck on geometry with the door  in his apartment. The game was difficult for me on normal but was far less challenging than the original Max Payne with the straight up broken bullet time allowing you to completely ignore the jump bullet time and run around while everyone else is in slo-mo. Apart from that relatively minor list of complaints this game is a worthy sequel that was as enjoyable if not more so than the original Max Payne",Sat Dec 14 16:44:27 EET 2019,b05c1e72-81f3-4a22-b71b-28005d3aa71c

STO Does have a gambling system called the lockbox (pay $1.25 for 1 key, and drop chances are usually 1/500) which needs to be fixed and balanced, but is otherwise pretty good. In all the game does have a nice story arc, but needs more max level activities, due to the lack of things available to max level characters. I will be making some guides in the future for this game if anyone needs to learn some things such as how Inertia, or momentum affects starships and etc. I PERSONALLY rate this game 10/10! but beware pay to wins and pay to players, they will GREATLY have a massive advantage over you.Most star ships I will say, are pay to play, but it is ENITRELEY possible and quite easy to get one Especially during the anniversary event (via omega particles) buy buying your wanted ship from the exchange.

Combine that with user-generated missions that while failing to provide decent rewards for your ship and leveling, provide for the huge nerd's dream of dealing with an actual Star Trek episode, or even two.Thankfully the monetization isn't too bad. Yes there is a cash market, but none of it is required in the least to be able to play.

This is the only game I've come back to. I understand some people complain about grinding, or about purchasing things etc. However, there are two things which make this formula acceptable, and here is why: the Devs continually modify and add to the game - they can't be expected to work for free. Secondly, in no way do you feel like you need to buy stuff with real money. If truth be told, most of what you might buy would either be some specific ships or extra docks (and of course, the EC cap). Sure, you can buy whatever else you'd like if you really want to, but you don't really need to. Considering that Zen is the currency which can be bought with real money, it should be noted that dilithium (an ingame only currency) can be obtained and then traded for Zen.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: PROS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Spock... is in the game. Leonard Nimoy's voice lives on in the game, alongside many, many other characters.Game mechanics are really good, and I consider them to be the norm on which any space game should be created upon.You can customize your characters with a fairly decent amount of costumes.An incredibly huge assortment of ships, and always growing.The Borg... as powerful as advertised in the shows and movies.Content has been either changed or removed/added in the past to improve the storyline.Every faction (Fed/Klingon/Rom) have a specific storyline until it merges.Each faction has a huge assortment of ships to select.Crafting system is extremely simple, and unique items can be obtained in such a way.Select whatever type of weapon types: phaser, disruptor, polaron, tetryon, anti-proton, plasma and other.Good voice acting.Global official giveaways - ships and items - and special events.:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CONS :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::The Borg... they drain your shields like it was nothing, and you can't do a thing about it - but that's also a Pro.Not as much content as I'd like.You do have to grind quite a bit, depending on what you want to achieve.The reputation system doesn't unlock every tier for every character once unlocked (this process is tedious), and takes 20 days at the very least, and 40 days initially (20 days once you obtain Sponsorship Tokens).Not enough costumes, hairstyles or beardstyles.Some specific characters cannot be modified, costume wise.Some races are not playable (yet), such as Cardassians, Breen, Vortas/Jem'Hadar, although you can usually create the look of most of them. Takes a while, of course.Personally, I have experienced frequent disconnects at some point (not always, but maybe once a month).Graphics are a bit dated, despite some improvements. Since game plays very well, and most players only care about space battles, it doesn't matter as much. ",Tue Dec 21 09:46:41 EET 2021,100b7b85-58df-4158-ad8f-51d03b72901c

The puzzles and challenges are not difficult but are quite rewarding. The bow in this game is so satisfying. I found myself only using the bow, with its assortment of arrows (fire, explosive etc). Equally satisfying is the shot gun. New items (grappling hook, climbing arrows etc) were introduced at appropriate times and for the most part worked as would expect. There is a lot of collection and reading of items. I found this tedious and quite frankly a luss. The Trinity enemies throw grenades at you, forcing you to move which made the combat more interesting. The combat is okay, and the stealth is what you would expect from this type of game. The AK-47 gun was shit in my opinion and I tended to only use it when I run out of arrows. The 'running away' from danger scenes were superb. They were very cinematic, with boulders falling before your feet and random platforms breaking; all the while, you had to jump and traverse the ground that is breaking beneath you. I found myself holding my breath as Lara leaps to some ledge in these cinematic sections of the game. nnThis game has TOO many cut scenes. It constantly took me out of the world which I did not like. I just wanted to shoot people and run around and explore. The absolute worst thing about this game, was that Lara does this weird ass movement when she goes through a small gap in a wall (there are many of such gaps). Firstly, it is shit because it is like a 2 second cut scene where I don't have control and she just squeezes through the hole, but the worst is that she does this dumb shit with her left hand like she is trying to blow away a fart or something.",Sat Nov 16 13:46:06 EET 2019,72489547-6912-4389-bcfc-551e38d8ce06

You cant just fly straight to enemy and kill him, you have to find weakness, like slow turning speed, or slow weapon recharge and use it for yourself. There are many ways how to kill other player with ""premium ship"" because his ship cant turn so fast as yours, so you keep being away from his weapons firing range and still shoot at him.2) Buy/Sell strategy. You have to buy and sell weapons and other stuff. You have scientific vessel, its having great shields. Now you need weapons. You cant buy just any, you have to be sure they can fire effectively and you can shoot everywhere. Boost your shields or new weapon? There are many decisions about fitting your ship and buying new stuff. Premium weapons can make you ""OP"". But same can do weapons from market for ingame money.3) RPG skills for ground fight.

Head out and start star treking.Depends though however how you like to trek. Lets make one thing clear you dont play this game to explore. If you want to do that play bridge crew. This game is heavily focused on a kill or be killed Star Trek adventure. With many different weapons, both ground and space, and ships, one can not simply have enough. Is this game pay to win?Honestly not in the way you think. First off dont play PVP, as someone who has bought ships even I hate PVP, some people have death dreadnaught able to slam you while you barely dent them. However, PVE allows any ship from free to premium. Premium currency exists as well as loot boxes, no surprise as it is free to play. However, you dont actually need to buy any. Every Summer and every Winter there is an event that everyone can play and by doing a short mission everyday for a couple days you are given a free ship which is on level with the new one released all the time (T6 ship). Those ships however, are not as iconic as the ones you would get with premium currency. Now you can grind the premium currency but it will take you a very very long time. In that case it is pay for convenience. The loot box system is unintrusive, unless you are a ship collector with some ships going for exuberant prices. All in all I like this game. I feel that if it keeps up with its numbers it could last a while and with the introduction of another faction right around the corner, who knows how long we will be able to cruise the galaxy together.",Tue Jan 25 07:30:51 EET 2022,fa108ea7-09f3-407a-8a15-318c67e9826b

It is so in depth, I have put 70 hours into the game and im still finding stuff out. It is highly customisable from yourself to your ship to your ship crew.  The stories are excellent if your a fan of Star Trek which I am, theres loads of reference to all the franchises with episodes of time travel to get your origianl series fill.The ship battles are my favourite. This isn't Dota you have a full array of abilities to chose from, my Naga gets a lot of use. I am really enjoying the Science vessel it is my kind of play style and feels like a character in itself. There are hundred of different ways you can play the ships. Having a science vessel but then having a tactical team or a mix of all. You even chose the different officers on your ship which then opens up different abilities which you can choose from.You get duty officers alos which you can send on mission and this can level you, get skill points and dilithium.I havent finished learning the game, there seems like there is much more and they are always improving it and adding new seasons.",Sat Oct 02 17:40:51 EEST 2021,046794d8-8ece-4bad-9e20-a2f1dbffb2b2

Long before I had Steam, back when it was vastly different than what I have seen now.Finding myself getting back to this gem was a nice refreshing taste of nostalgia - and a bit of dissapointment. Some of what I saw as the more fun and Trek-like gameplay is gone. Random missions is replaced with sporatic patrols that shift daily that you need to find. But despite the loss, there is so much more added I can really start to appreciate this game, and willing to admit I'm a lifer now. I've come back to this game time and time again - and it does hold an aspect that I see worth visiting.Many of the old, glitchy, unwanted parts (and I bet many of the negative reviews here are based on those) are long since gone. New elements have been added to help encourage a wider and more varried feel to the game. Many aspects have been added or changed to encourage development of really impressive improvements. R&D got an overhaul with the Duty Officers you gain, making it easier to earn good stuff - and add the possibility of making your own unique and impressive equipment. Bridge Officers have the ability to learn multiple skills, so you can have just a few favorites for the ideal team mix but still have the ability to shift what powers they use to simplify things in certain situations. Player Traits have been vastly overhauled. Parts of it I regret missing, you can't have an overpowered selection of a dozen or more Reputation traits powering you up - but you can now shift between selections in certain areas not in combat zones. And the mixing is balanced out well so far.You can make your captain and crew into what you dream here, in many surprising ways.But comes the only glaring problem I see - its an MMO. Its a kill or be killed area where damage is king. Grinding is a must and you gotta mow down mobs en masse. RP'ers will find some loss in certain builds and styles just not up to par - and if you want the top gear, you'll need to grind. And some grinds can't be done without a certain level of killing strength, so some things - just can't cut it. Doesn't feel very Trek at times. But I can't really call that a truly negative part at the moment.STO is Trek, just not the TV or Movie Trek. Its another Trek, in another galaxy. Another mirrored universe almost where you need to adapt to new enemies and threats. And face a hard truth. Kill or be killed.Outside of that, the game itself is showing an unbelieveable ammount of improvements over time. Focusing more on gameplay mechanics to help make enjoying the game easier. You just need to learn that over time.The Trek part? Well, its there. Cameoes, nods, and a great deal of effort in stories. But some of the later aspects really don't fit like I wish they did. But this isn't really the same Trek I would want it to be. Its not bad, just different. Can't honestly fault that anymore.Its a good MMO, with good merits and definetly something I could reccomend as you could find what you want in here somewhere - it certainly does have its size to go for it. That and the Foundry. Player-created content is a huge aspect of the game and if you got the time, you'll find a whole slew of additions to content and story that makes this game well worth the visit. The hard part is just finding it.But that's a bit of the charm. There is so much here, so much possibility. There is good, and bad - but overall, its trying a respectable rate to be better. I gotta admit that's worth it itself.Now the somewhat dated graphics and cartain core elements - well, that's just cause its an older game. But don't let that dissuade you here. You'll find something worth visiting, and even more worth coming back for. I know I have.",Mon Dec 13 02:57:27 EET 2021,8024dd3f-a277-4364-85ec-367d0034deef

I have played shooters all my life, grew up with the PS2 and PS3, and never touched true CRPGs like the original FO games until 4 months ago. Everything that made FO1 great (despite it's imperfections) is here, but far more detailed, expansive, and humorous in a way that is so hilarious yet offensive that it is crazy to imagine they were even put in here. Seriously, there are parts in this game that feel like Lloyd Kaufman wrote it. Somehow, it is able to juggle the humor along with the serious elements. People act like 1 is the bleakest game, which tonally I'd say is true, but the stuff in 2 is arguably darker. Slavery everywhere, drug overdosing in most places, prostitution, child murder, etc. The amount of world building here is literally God tier. Corruption even in the most ""peaceful"" places. The ambiguity of morality. The music of 1 helping sustain this toxic atmosphere, while adding in my view some of the best tracks Mark Morgan ever graced us with. My God. This thing is an absolute monster. nnMy journey with Fallout started with New Vegas roughly a year ago, which is an awesome RPG that helped me become obsessed with the franchise. Instead of going after 3 and 4, I decided to try the classics. I had difficulty with the first game, not simply for its infancy in terms of old mechanics (which it would improve in the sequel), but it's rough pacing in the first segments of the game. Not the most detailed areas, despite the great characters, wonderful atmosphere, and truly epic story ending. I love how overtly dark it is compared to the rest of the series, and I feel that pure tone has never been caught since. It is truly the saddest Fallout game. Period. nnYou think NV had a bad development period? Fallout 2 was made in [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2#:~:text=According%20to%20co-founder%20of,to%20make%20the%20whole%20game"".] 9 months [/url].. I can't imagine how they were able to accomplish so much despite that clearly rushed time period. The improvements it makes from Fallout 1 are not just mechanics. It's not just that companions are better (AI still wacky, don't let Marcus use a minigun lmao, but there is more control) or how you can move NPCs now. Dialogue is significantly better. Choices are significantly better. The story is imo overall just amazing, as good as the original if not better for me. Never in my life would I think that playing a porn star would look so FUN in a game. The characters, despite my true love for the Master and Set, are just better. Sulik, Marcus, Myron (yes, Myron), Sargent Dornan, etc. etc. Freaking Frank Horrigan. The inverseness of this game story wise is a wonderful development off of Fallout 1. God I just love this game I cannot stand it. Don't even get me started on the cut content like the [url=https://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/rainbow-confederation-encounter.160524/] Rainbow Confederation [/url] or the freaking original [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Childkiller?file=Child_Killer.png] Child Killer Reputation [/url] artwork. It's amazing in how more mature this game is compared to later titles. nn[h1]Tips for New Players[/h1]nnIf anything, I'd recommend anyone who has the patience to try older titles and games to give this a shot. Part of me wonders if people should start with 2 and then go for 1, but I also feel my experience with 1 was invaluable to me being able to ""jump into"" 2 without much problems. There are a few tips I want to give to those wanting to play that helped me play the game: nn[b]1)[/b] Save often. I don't mean ""save every 10-15 minutes."" I mean have several saves, a quicksave, every time you are about to get into combat, when you are going through a building fighting people save every time combat ends, etc. Save save save. It will save you a lot of pain. nn[b]2)[/b] If you are new, just follow the big quest stuff that gives you hints. Talk to everyone, think about the context of FO1 lore, look and loot places. In the Klamneth? Loot around near where the rats are, particularly a broken car to the east in that area. Saved Vic? Look in his inventory, what's that he's got there? Know how to loot. Make sure, because it's not always clear, to look around the room *carefully.* I straight up missed holes in the ground because walls blocked them, or didn't realize in places like New Reno that some staircases (Mordino Family for example) also go downstairs. Etc etc. I could probably think of hundreds of more, but these are good enough I think. nn[b]3)[/b] Understand the city map system. When you go to a town, it gives you options of where to go within it. Sometimes you may park your Highwayman and think it got stolen (again >:]) but really you just parked it in a different spot in town. Some places you need to look at the whole city map in order to travel to that specific spot. Just be aware of that. When in doubt, exit the area. Also, make sure you explored the whole face of the sections of town you are in. Lowkey missed the Poseidon Powerplant in Gecko simply because I didn't move my view all the way to the right lol. nn[b]4)[/b] Bugs. Honestly, I think I've had more crashes with FO3 lol, but 2 as well as the 1 can crash. Bugs suck and the game only has a few annoying ones (randomly slows down for no reason for a bit, screen blackens and clears up as you move your cursor around, etc.), but ONE in particular is real bad. There is a game breaking bug if you aren't careful. It's not exactly clear what the bug is or where it comes from, but many people call it the ""Too Many Items"" bug. Essentially, at a certain point, whenever you go into Chinatown in San Francisco, the game will crash every time. This is one of the many reasons multiple saves is very important. I was able to be in Chinatown a lot, but supposedly the bug occurs when you put too many items in the trunk of your Highwayman (yeah, that car ALSO has a trunk. I found that out by accident after using it for 5 hours LOL). You can still access the Tanker, but the moment you there, or anywhere else in the city, you have to go through Chinatown to leave, which will result in a crash. It makes your next trip into SF a one way trip. nnIf you are curious about the bug, I played this game raw (no mods) and it seems like some like the Restoration Mod fixed it? It's not super clear tho. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/38410/discussions/0/1698293703771299385/] This person [/url] was able to figure it out on their own (read the comments too). Check out the [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/User:Porter21/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide#The_too_many_items_bug] fallout wiki [/url] for more info too. nn[b]5)[/b] Lastly, I'll say this because I think it's good for anyone who's new nn[h1] Closing Statement [/h1] nnBasically, it's an awesome game for the main story, fun and serious side quests, and characters. NV is really good, but I think that 2 is the true masterpiece of the series. It is the game the future franchise built itself off of, for better or worse. I have not played a lot of video games in my life, but I think I understand the love here. I love it to death too. Truly a CLASSIC. nn[b] 10 / 10 [/b]nn[i] ""As for the tanker vagrants...well, as vagrants do...they drifted on~""[/i]nnhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soF3t7cFPo",Sun Oct 25 18:22:59 EET 2020,5252aa81-537f-45e1-bb75-bba79c67536f

I would recommend using this patch - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451nn[h1] Looks and sound [/h1] nThis Game has not aged well in terms of graphics. The lighting is fine but the textures are pretty old and there was never anything striking about the art direction. In general I find that 3D games don't age well. I do like the way the game mixed the traditional CRPG gameplay with an action-RPG control scheme and letting the player look around the area instead of always being in the isometric perspective.nnThe soundtrack though has stood the test of time for me. It was composed by Inon Zur who is known for his work on the Fallout games and Pathfinder Kingmaker. The music fits well with the general tone of the game and there's a good variety of combat music to stop it from feeling stale.nn[h1] Combat [/h1] nI've played a bunch of games with RTWP in the past few years and I think this is so far my favorite one. I'm not sure what about it made me enjoy it more than Pillars or Pathfinder. It could be how the character progression and subclasses are easier to grasp while still carrying a good amount of variety or the fact that I don't have to rest after fights for spell uses. I played a mage and this game pretty much exemplifies the trope of 'linear warriors and quadrilateral wizards'. I felt exceptionally limited at the start compared to my party members but by the end I was drowning in variety and versatility. This game has a lot of sublasses, called specializations and they can change your build a lot. I mostly played a traditional wizard for the player character but I had a fighter-templer, a shapeshifter-wizard and a healer-wizard which gave a lot of choices in how to tweak my party setup.nnThe game is surprisingly well balanced for the most part other than one fight in the main questline. Even the optional bosses which looked harder weren't too much for a new player like me to handle on normal difficulty.nn[h1]Story and Worldbuilding[/h1]nThe story follows a Grey Warden who has to stop a horde of evil creatures, the darkspawn from taking over the nation of Ferelden. The quests mostly have the player going to different locations and convincing the local leaders to assist the grey wardens in fighting the threat. It's a simple but effective message of how some squabbles can be meaningless in the face of a threat which requires mass co-operation. Each leader is facing their own set of issues and is located in a separate part of the map where there a lot of different questlines set up. There's a pretty good variety of choices with different outcomes which can be affected by one's race, build and stats.nnThe companions of this game range from a knight Templar grey warden, a shapeshifter rogue mage, a failed assassin, a healer mage, a warrior from a vastly different culture and some others. There's a good enough variety in terms of character and classes for companions. DAO manages to keep companions active in the game by having them react to your decisions with positive or negative reputations along with personal questlines which often depend on those reputations.nnThe Worldbuilding of Dragon Age takes inspiration from the Blight of the Wheel of Time and Morder from Lord of the Rings but it's not a simple copy paste. There's a surprising amount of thought and detail behind the darkspawn in the setting and how the Grey Wardens are entwined with them. In general it feels like the writers really asked the logical questions to introducing certain concepts and then applied that to the world. This sounds simple but requires a lot of planning and it's really satisfying to see how everything sort of clicks and makes sense. The way mages are treated and behave is one such example. It makes sense that people with such destructive potential who are also prone to being possessed would be feared and reviled while at the same time needed for certain purposes.nnnOverall I recommend this game to anyone who likes story based fantasy games, is looking to get into CRPGs or wanting to try RTWP(real time with pause) gameplay.nnI will be making a seperate review for the Awakening DLC which I think is massive enough to warrant a seperate version but the short version would be that it's good and you should get it too or just get the ultimate edition",Tue Feb 08 05:51:02 EET 2022,34dc6468-23d7-415f-8f56-ba9ed586daef

Star Trek Online allows one to fulfill all of their dreams of having a role in Star Trek. You have the option of three (four if you count the semi TOS version of the Feds) options for your character, Federation, Romulans, and the Klingons. Many actors from the series have come on as voice actors to portray their characters. The game also allows you to progress from and Ensign to a Fleet Admiral (Using Federation ranks). As for the gameplay itself, you have a ship on ship combat and away team combat. The ship combat can be as complicated as you want it, you could spam fire all weapons, or set up loadouts and your crews abilities and tailor your actions to each combat scenario. The ground combat is from a third person perspective and is more of a point and click type of conflict than anything else. So far, I have not had an issue with repetitively because of foundry missions. These are missions created by other players, and some are very good. The missions that are produced by the developers are usually good. However, there may be a few bad ones that you may want to take advantage of the ""skip"" button.

This game makes you think twice and then think again about all of your actions. Although there may not be as many ""consequences"" as the developers would want you to believe, if you are anything like me, your moral compass will bend its arrows with each time you act before you consider the aftermath. And that has nothing to do with in-game mechanics (well, maybe in some particular instances it has).nnHonestly, a quite heavy game which can leave you overwhelmed with all sorts of emotions (depending on your choices, obviously). Still, I have no regrets whatsoever. The setting itself is fabuluous (pun intended), most characters have the necessary depth to them, and the plot leaves you thinking. A lot.nnOverall, a great game. Surely, more can be said about the world of TWAU, but only diving into it yourself can provide the ultimate experience, the surface of which I merely scratched with this review",Thu Sep 24 10:52:52 EEST 2020,cdad8a11-ac56-4972-bdea-182a2e068922

Steam says 1900 hours, but i bet its like 2200 already without the Steam Client. i played it from the beginning, not constantly , but now and then with friends. Is it old and feels a bit clunky? Yes. Could it use an overhaul? Yes. Is it good? Hell yes! Even with its outdated graphics and technology, this game is still somewhat addictive and fun, especially when you play it with friends. It is a free to play model, that is true. But most content (also endgame related content) is free and you can gain it via missions and work. The so called ""grind"" is something that you can do on a stand-by, since its literally getting some simple ressources (5 - 10 min work) and then clicking on ""earn reputation"" , and wait 20 hours to complete the task. That is literally all you have to do for ""endgame content"". No hours and hours of hard work with repetetive fighting and gathering. While the graphics isnt something everyone likes, this game gives you a very good executed story with hours of voice-overs, interesting missions and complete customization. You want your crew to wear a special uniform? Go for it! You want to customize your own skills, your crew skills and the weaponry of your character, your crew (away team) AND your ship? Go for it! You dont like Starfleet? You would rather play a deceptive Romulan with their cool ships, or a warmonger Klingon with a massive dreadnought? Go for it! This game has massive customization options, hundrets of ships, and an interesting take on ""Quests"". You hate being send to get some random drops like wolf-fangs or bear-claws with your task being slaughtering hundrets of monsters to finally get the drops to your npc? Well, Star Trek Online has NONE of such quests. Every single mission is literally a story, with you and your crew flying through the galaxy to distant planets and fighting huge battleships with torpedos, phasers and disruptors, but also holstering your guns and rifles and beaming down to get into dangerous close quarter combat in an enemy base to rescue hostages or find artefacts. True, they could have done the controls a bit better, but if you are able to literally adjust your controls and keymapping  to your liking, you will have alot of fun. I only say: ""Switch to shooter mode!"" , and turn your mmo in a third person shooter. If you are a Star Trek Nerd, you even can write your own log files. Oh, you have done all the story missions, and raids and fleet actions are nothing for you? How about you play one of the ten-thousands of missions of the foundry? Its a pool of community created missions that are mostly checked by the developers and being rated by players. Even there you have voice over. There is literally ""endless ingame content"" if you are searching for missions and quests en mass. And if you are a munchkin who likes to jingle a bit with numbers and calculations about the best gear, visit the Star Trek Online wiki and loose your mind about how much you can learn and do here. XDDont let yourself get tricked by ""only"" 3 classes... engineer, tactical or science. The class choice is literally only for selecting your base-abilities of ""you wanna do damage"" , ""you wanna heal or control"" or ""you wanna have a mixture of both"" . You can be a tactical player with grenades, supressing fire and damage buffs, while also flying a science ship or a cruiser. You are not bound by class, and you can literally choose your skills freely. All in all, i can promise that the game offers many options and gameplay mechanics that may be unusual for an mmo, but if you can overlook its age and the sometimes little technical problems, you will find a gem that can literally brighten up your day. Do some ships or species cost money? Yes, but honestly, this game has potential to entertain you far more than any actuall tripple A title with their usual 20 hours of storyplay, so you can honor the developers hard work with a few bucks to spend on this game. If i am generous with my calculation and even say a tripple A title would have 30 hours of entertainment in storyline, i would have had to buy 66 games to entertain me that long like Star Trek Online did. So yeah, have my 20 bucks for a nice endgame ship and let me play some more. ^^",Sat Oct 30 03:52:18 EEST 2021,4b402d20-4902-42ef-a652-7e72ce652206

Design your own starships! You can even design the uniform! Come on!You can fly your ship through enemy space, brush up against cameos of your favorite characters, boldy go where noone has gone before, bounce the graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish, and explore strange new worlds to your heart's content!True, the game is dated, but the graphics are NOT bad for an 8 year old game. The character models are better than many games I've played and there's a decent amount of customization. I like playing really true-to-show experiences, but the ""make your own alien"" option was amazingly fun. Whether you want to make a race one could TOTALLY believe was in a Trek world somewhere, or create a hideous (or hilarious) abomination, the system is great fun. Worth fiddling with even if you won't play one, just to see what you can do with it.Seriously, the moment I stepped into the story and started flying my own ship around, I was living out my Trekkie fantasies of my own show with a captain just how I wanted her. I played a Trill after the nature of my favorite character ever (Jadzia Dax of course!) and the tutorial was barely over before I started reading the dialogue out loud and giving orders verbally, including whatever Trek-no-babble I could manage, just for the fun of it. Yes, I'm a giant geek, but I totally recommend you let yourself give into the urge to just ENJOY this game for what it does well: a wonderful story full of content that well and truly makes you feel like whatever character you chose to be.Play it for the story. Your own Star Trek story. Play this as a delightfully free story-driven action/adventure title and you will not be disappointed.Not-recommended if: You want to play it for other reasons than the story. You want a thriving, living game with a solid, friendly community. You want to have the best stuff, the shiniest ships, and truly be able to compete  in the end-game scene, and you don't have a ton of money to spend.

Secret of Monkey Island has some of the wittiest writing, flat out funny characters and engaging setting that really propels it above other point and clicks. I greatly appreciate the ability to toggle between the old spritework of the original and the new graphics with the simple push of a button, however if I had to nitpick one thing I wish you could keep the voice acting while playing on the original graphics. Ah well. Secret of Monkey Island is a fantastic game, one of the very best if not the best point and click adventure game right up there with the best of the genre like Fate of Atlantis and Grim Fandango, and while the puzzles are not nearly as devious as the latter game (don't even get me started on Grim Fandango that game is downright evil with some of its puzzles) the puzzles here are challenging enough to leave you stumped but never stuck for hours on end like many games of the 90s were known to do.

While still very playable and enjoyable, the enemy AI tends to gang up on the player, leaving them very little room to maneuver and use the tools the game gives them. Also, the camera and the way the Prince soft locks onto targets leaves a lot to be desired. These issues were common and ""normal"" in games of its generation though. In fact, I'd argue they weren't originally viewed as problems at all. But today, with the advancements in combat mechanics seen over multiple generations of games, it is hard not to look back and judge this game a bit more harshly that it probably deserves. nnPoP: Sands of Time stands on its own with a beautiful beginning and ending. Although the sequels are good in their own right (and very different in tone), it is safe to say that this first entry can be played by itself or with them as a trilogy.nnSide note: I played this recently on Windows 11 and this game has never been updated for modern machines. There are some good guides to fix some common issues available here on Steam. The only issue I was unable to fix was some low dialogue audio during gameplay.

Star Trek Online has come a long way from the 49.99 shelf price I picked it up at. From beaming down to that alien world of your favorite Star Trek episode, to fighting the Borg across the sector. Each piece culminates into a game anyone who enjoys Sci-fi can love. Trekkies of course get the opportunity to visit each of those scenes they loved most in Star Trek.The current iteration of Star Trek Online is quite simply put, 'Marvelous' and only getting better with the addition of the Delta Quadrant. PVE is the main focus, but PVP is possible in specified battle zones. Surprisingly, and a wonderful touch in my opinion—has been the growing addition of Voice Actors for a number of main quests, and most importantly, voice acting by actual Star Trek actors, come to replay their digital roles. Some of STO’s original voice acting flops, but they have gotten very good at putting the proper emotion behind their voice actor’s character. Each new addition is far better than the last. More than anything else, in this game…the story is perhaps the cherry on top. Wrapping the player into a universe that is similar, and yet so very different from the shows we used to watch. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction of any kind, just wants to kill things in space ships, or loves a good story. Oh, and of course if you are a trekkie, why aren’t you playing already? ",Tue Jan 04 10:25:49 EET 2022,0f88b384-6e7f-4bee-8d85-aa4310bd3e0f

I really lived through the events with Connor, Kara and Markus. All three are gorgeous and fascinating in their own ways. I had picked the peaceful approach for the android uprising and seeing unarmed, peacefully protesting people being gunned down, seeing them rounded up in dismantling camps and thrown onto gigantic trashpiles as if they're just defective toasters or toys was really depressing and heartbreaking. nnDetroit: Become Human isn't just an incredibly story-rich game, it's also touching philosophical and ethical questions; about how to deal with lifelike, perfectly human looking ""machines"". Are they just property, bought and sold like slaves, damned to obey and to be destroyed whenever one feels like it? Or are they alive, sentient beings with emotions, wishes, fears and hopes? nnEven though I'm not really a fan of action adventures with a lot of quick-time events, I thoroughly enjoyed the gaming experience. nnI had just one freezing crash after the intro and that was gone after installing the newest nVidia driver (for GeForce RTX 3060 TI). The game runs with 60 FPS, without stuttering, freezing or other issues now. nnI'm playing without a controller, with keyboard and mouse. That worked surprisingly well even though I had to use the RMB for moving the camera manually back behind the characters again whenever they rounded corners. It's still no biggie and wouldn't distract me from the pacing and flow of the game. nnI can wholeheartedly recomment this game.

New ship teir upgrades seem to be just a way to get more money from people for getting them to pay for upgrading their ships to the new level cap... overall would say game is going down hill in terms of enjoyablity, but still there is a lot of content and story you can play for free... but you can and do play it all solo... so i guess the big question is, why is this called an MMO, other than chat and a great friendly community, there really isn't a lot (or any) multiplayer gaming involved...Love this game. Stays true to Star Trek style without getting to MMO gimmicky. For a long long time (years and years) there was no level cap increase, which I liked. It made it not about levels, there was just new expansion packs, missions, story and new epic ships, gear, and classes. Made it more about the gameplay and less about grinding.Pros: Giant emersive star trek universeRidiculous amout of missions and contentRPG style for both your main character, you bridge officers and your ship adds a nice changeSpace combat is awersome. dynamic fights and strategy plays a large part in success not just better gear. yet still simple enough and not to complicated like Wing Commander where on top of everything else you need to learn to fly. Cons:PVP is very limiting. there are two factions at war, but PVP feels like a trapped collaseum of bashing each other till another ship explodes, pvp matches are also limited to how many people can fight. Compared to other MMO RPGs with PVP where you are running around with 30 or 40 other people it feels less MM and more like a group of friends came over for board game night. Ground combat: ground missions add a great change to space missions for sure, and the unique skills, puzzles, and enemies types keeps things interesting. and while I have seen some people group for ground 'raids' to get crystals and gear, the game makes it less enjoyable to actually participate in ground combat and has no insentive for ground PVP so no one really does it.Crafting: crafting has changed a lot over the years in this game. the first version was cool cause it was very 'Star Trek' like with various types of crafting each with sub crafting types, very star trek specialization. I liked this for this reason, made me feel more apart of the star trek universe. However, and understandable so, it made being able to craft everything incredible difficult (if thats what you want, its not for me, but I know lots of MMO gamers who do) and required 100's of specific and different crafting materials. So they changed it. simplifed a bunch of it, and reduced mats, and got rid of the sub specities.... then I took a year off the game and came back,... and it was changed again... even more simplfied but also now completly useless. None of the craftable gear was anything you would ever want to use. The had changed the way the 'fleet' bases worked and all the gear that was worth 'crafting/buying' was now sold at your fleets starbase. (the rest of the gear worth getting became reputation gear from the borg/omega/romulan expansions).Last con: this game has changed owners so many times and each time different people try to do different things with it and it has changed the way the game is played.  Perpetual Entertainment started working on it for the first 4 years, i signed up with them to be notifed when the game was ready and for beta testing, When Cryptic Studios took over development after Perpetual went bankrupt and started their codebase from scratch, I was never informed and the list I signed up for on the website was never transfered over and it was kinda ridiculous when I found out I had to sign up again. Atari did a really good job of adding new missions to the game but when they no longer wanted to be in the MMO ring they sold the game (and other MMOs) to Perfect World Entertainment, who already owned a vast array of MMO games. Although PWE has done some really good things for STO (the last two expansions were great), they changed the in game currancy and micro cash transaction system to match their exisiting games that clearly make them money, and they baught STO to make them money so it makes sense but it also made STO less like a star trek MMO in a star trek universe and more like a very 'gamey' environment, where everything was setup to game you into buying things. Which completly changed the dynamic and how the game was played in a not so positive way (if you were enjoying the star trek universe anyway). Its still a great game, just feels more like a futuristic sci-fi game now and less like you are in the star trek universie. I list this as a con because who knows who will own it next or what they will do with it.",Thu Jan 16 12:20:39 EET 2020,828aeacf-c608-4a7f-bb6d-9233d2d64ea0

Back then it was like a hollow shell, filled with boring things to do, not many cool things and mostly it was just kind of bland. Now, however, they've totally revamped the game it's no longer what it used to be. It's fun, engaging, exciting and for us Trekkies (LLAP!   \\//,) it's become the game we all wanted it to be. I highly recommend it for any Sci-fi fan, Trekkie, MMORPG'er or mixed FPS/3rd Person style gamer, it doesnt play like any other game I've played. It has an incredibly versatile battle system for fighting in space and on the ground. They've bulked it up with exsquisitely created fan mods which are stories you can playthrough...basically player created DLC. They've added all kinds of new types of missions: diplomatic, space missions, research missions, ground missions of all sorts, away team missions and lots of sweet new gear to boot. The characters themselves look the best they've ever looked; when I first began playing I was very disappointed in the way they looked, they were all sort of the same looking. Now, the characters have tight gear and outfits that are totally unique (assuming you have some epic stuff to equip and in some cases, even if you don't!).                               As you continue to level up, you just look cooler and cooler. The ships are sick as well and since you can choose 3 separate factions (Klingon, Romulan, Fedreration) then you have a choice of some sweet Romulan ships (which are all epic thanks to their singularity warp drive ftw) or if you want a cool Klingon Bird-of-Prey or a classic (or newer!) Federation ship (also, any race can play any faction). The weapons have become more and more epic over the years just like everything else in STO. 100% Worth a shot, if you've been uncertain about whether or not to go for it, now would be the time.

With a high production value, quite remarkable music score and high quality dialogue for what little dialogue there is the game feels quite polished to date. For the Starship junkie such as myself, the ships look detailed and true to canon. The main quest is gripping and enjoyable, it makes levelling a breeze with a good balance of investment and reward as your character levels.In contrast to other free-to-play MMO’s, the micro-transactions in this game are kept to a minimum; most purchases made from the Cash shop are entirely cosmetic, which have little to no impact on game-play, and are not necessary in the progression of your character. In addition to that, the in-game currency Dilithium can be converted to large sums of cash shop credit, offering economical alternatives for those that don’t wish to outlay any cash, but spend vast amounts of time playing.Space combat is one of its strengths, you will have direct control over your ship and its stations with everything laid-out in front of you. Basic Starship operation and commands are very intuitive with control tight and concise. Yet, ground combat is another story. On the ground, your skills are vastly different from that in space, how effective your combat will be will be dependent on the your chosen away team, with the focus on movement, your equipment and environmental hazards, as well as the groups of varying enemies. Coupled with the rather basic RPG style of button mashing to complete your attach, ground missions will wear out their welcome sooner rather than later.Space exploration itself is somewhat of a disappointment, for an open-world title, the experience you’ll have amongst the different sectors and its planets are at best, predictable and simple. Most missions comprise of destroying ships or scanning structures. While the strong story arc helps break the monotony and generally tie pieces together, most of the open-world encounters have little to no plot or reward for your time invested.In comparison to other MMO’s, the amount of content can be scarce, once you have reached your characters level cap and completed the official episodes you will have very little to do, especially if you’re the one to play solo. Playing with a friend or joining a guild will be highly recommended to break the monotony of grinding and the entertainment flowing. While all MMO’s have their fair share of grinding, the problem here is the lack of variety on what to grind at. For a free-to-play MMO, this game does stand-out amongst the rest. It’s well-polished, true to Star Trek lore and canon and an enjoyable experience within a group, and on the plus side, you get to be a Star Ship Captain. As a relatively high-quality product, it’s the community that will once again let it down. Every on-line game has its fair share of elitists and career orientated players that often need to stop and brush the Dorito crumbs from their neck-beards every once in a while and thankfully the community can be filtered out.",Sun Dec 05 22:41:36 EET 2021,8124c0f8-bd1d-4f4f-9dd9-94ee19e9da83

So read on for the full waffle otherwise...Pros' - Free, Trekkie, Story, Ground & Space combat.Cons - Pricey, Grindy.If you like MMO's, which in gerneral I don't, then you'll probably like this. Theres is plenty of busy work, as I call it, stuff to grind at to unlock better stuff and when you get to Level 50+ you unlock even more busy stuff to keep you busy for litterally hours as well as the usual events that these sort of things have, such as the recent Christmas event, which I joined into too late, so I ignored it.A big word of warning though, the game does a really poor job of explaining most of these mechanics and you'll be left asking the community questions alot.However I have been taking part, mostly, to the 7th Anniversary event that is currently on as of writing. Which again is very grindy and not really my thing but like I said if your into MMO's you'll probably love this, as its abit different to others that I've tried over the years, it has the 3rd person combat, that seems to be most MMo's style but also the space combat, which is also 3rd person, so basically the same combat mechanic really but it does vary it just enough to keep things aleast abit more interesting.However, if your not into MMO's but your either a Trekkie like myself or maybe a fan of RPG, then I would suggest giving this a go as well. As if your a Trekkie then, its a chance to be your 'own Captain', which four different gaming openings which do really good job of drawing you into the story of the universe on offer. However its got too be said that once you get past the opening intros, then it really just sidelines you into either the Federation of the Klingon paths and even them do have cross over stories with each other.But saying that, if your not a Trekkie but an RPG fan, then you probs still like this, as the stories aleast on the first time of playing through are interesting to keep you play.Like I said, I'm not a MMO fan but I am a Trekkie and a RPG fan, so I've been playing mostly just through the story, ignoring all the padding and I'll probs stop playing once I've finished the main game story, treat it just like an normal RPG in essence rather than MMO.And lets face it is free, so why not? However like most games of this time, the in game purchases are rather expensive. To buy a first Tier ship (the first class of ship you can unlock), its basically £5, with the second tier being a £10. And it keeps climbing to tier 6. So obviously I havent spent a penny on it, and at these prices I won't be either. If the ships cost say £1 each, regardless of tier then being a Trekkie I would be more tempted. As you unlock more ships after every 10 levels, luckly you are given a free ship every 10 levels as well, so as you upgraded to a stronger class of ship requirement, the game does let you keep pace without spending money but your selection for a free ship is at most a choice between three, so as a Trekkie your always saying, awww but I want that ship! But given the choice I'd rather spend the money of an actual physical model, so developers making it cheaper if you want my cash!",Tue Jun 09 05:19:20 EEST 2020,eef6a2bd-8a70-4c96-8f96-d7139d77434a

This game’s environments and robotic dinosaurs are absolutely stunning. From the subtle specular highlights on ground cover, to the lighting on the swaying limbs of huge trees, and the exquisite texture work covering literally everything, this game captures a dense outdoor setting like no other. And if the dinosaurs weren’t impressive enough, with their hyper detailed modeling, and weighty animations, the addition of pieces which can break off and weak spots which can burst, feeds right into the gameplay’s clarity and appeal. The action in these fights is consistently intense and every new robot poses unique and interesting challenges. Various ammo types, status effects, and armor must be considered in order to be most effective as well. The amount of work that went into this game’s environmental graphics and the robotic dinosaurs is astounding.nnThat said, it doesn't mean I want to travel through the world, as good as it may look, just following objective markers for hours on end, or fight a dinosaur that acts more like a damage sponge. For everything this game gets right, it usually gets something else wrong. It’s very polished on the surface but the foundation leaves a lot to be desired. Underneath you will find the mediocre template of pretty much every other modern open world game. The added RPG mechanics and crafting are very hit or miss and the game doesn’t do a great job at justifying their inclusion. Most of the time it just means you need to go gather, loot, or purchase some arbitrary resource. nnI am typically leery toward open world games, but given HZD’s reputation, a friend's high recommendations, and my own intrigue, I decided to give it a try. In the end HDZ was okay, and did not feel like a waste of time, but it did feel like a deeply flawed game. It reaches higher highs than something like Watch_Dogs 2, but it also lacks the sandbox design and creativity of that game. And compared to the exploration master, Zelda BotW, or the role playing master, Skyrim, HZD doesn't have much going for it. Like pretty much all open world games, the map is about twice as big as it should be, and the game would have been greatly improved by simply moving everything closer together and cutting out all bad quests. I feel HZD would have worked well in a linear format, or at least a sectioned open world, similar to NeiR Automata, Sekiro, and even the Halo trilogy. None of the gameplay on offer in Horizon Zero Dawn justifies having a world so needlessly big, and more often than not I just wanted to get back to the fun stuff. Open world maps work for games with heavy sandbox elements, which HZD lacks. So traversing the world just became the equivalent of scrolling through a menu for minutes at a time in order to select the next button. Of course fast travel is an option once you’ve already visited a place, but that creates problems by going to the other extreme. Developers seriously just need to shrink their maps and make traversal into more substantial gameplay. nnI was quite invested in the story at first, as Aloy seeing past the tribal superstitions due to her upbringing is a fascinating angle, but the final third of the game bets on the player wanting to go run errands for a character named Silence. Aloy is actively annoyed by these quests, and I got pretty annoyed too. HZD’s world has some interesting lore but forcing the player to uncover it’s biggest secrets via errand quests was an awful decision. Now take into account the uncanny visuals, sloppy writing, and lackluster voice acting. I understand that making a game of this scale is going to have some automated animations, but wow they do not work, and negatively impact every conversation. The way the dialogue is written often feels like they were trying to reach a minimum word count, as characters can talk for minutes at a time and say nothing of value. The voice acting struggles most in the tense scenes, they always sound pretty calm even if someone is about to die. And like I said, there is good lore and the set up for a solid story, but the execution really misses the mark.   nnThe soundtrack and art style are fine. It’s exactly what you’d expect from tribal and futuristic aesthetics mashed together.  nnIn conclusion, Horizon Zero Dawn was an ambitious video game. Perhaps too ambitious for it’s developers, Guerrilla Games. The robot-dinosaur combat, and mysterious lore carry most of the experience. If you are not bothered by padded open world games you may enjoy this, but to anyone else wondering if this game is worth their money and time, sadly, I would not recommend Horizon Zero Dawn",Mon Nov 22 22:49:57 EET 2021,d67625f6-c23d-4897-b2bb-c88a3b434733

Before DR it was fun to get in and play the content, and grinding was not the only focus in the game. However, that has now changed.Don't get me wrong, going from level 1-50 is still as enjoyable as before. It is when you get to level 50 that you feel like you are punished for doing so. The DR expansion gave us a new level cap of 60. However, there is not enough mission content to help you level up.They want us to now repeatedly run patrol missions for stupid amount of times just for one level. This is to keep players in the game longer, instead of offering content to keep players in the game longer, like before.Everything is being monetized. They are revamping things in the game, just to try to monetize it. The crafting system, and now the Bridge Officer (BOFF) system. Also, they created an upgrade system that they are using to monetize on by asking outrageous amounts of Dilithium for them also.Just to clearify, Dilithium is the most expensive resource in STO. It can be used to exchange for Zen (their game store to buy stuff in), or to buy gear that is usualy better quality weapons or gear than mission rewards, or loot drops. There is Dilithium ore, which is what you get for rewards, and Refined Dilithium, which is what you turn the Dilithium ore into. The major problem is that you can only refine 8,000 per day, per character.With the extreme amounts of Dilithium requirements in the game now, it is near impossible for a new player (casual or hard core) to reach a competitive state without paying out real money for Zen to convert into Dilithium. But, before the DR expansion, it was easy for a very casual player to reach a level where they were competetive in just a few months.Instead of fixing isues with the game being unbalanced, they sell power creep. A lot of bugs go unfixed, and many have been in the game since before I started playing.When I first started playing, I would have, and did recommend it to other people. I was able to see the potential the game had. Yet, over the years it has turned into a game that focused on punishing grind after grind to replace actual content. And there is so much grind in the game that it strongly encourages players to spend money to get the new power creep, so you can do it just a little bit faster.The game is now in a sad state. The main developer that oversees the game even admited that he doesn't care what players (their customers) say, and has repeatedly insulted players, and even accused them of exploiting the game, when it was being played as it was designed by them.I would not recommend Star Trek Online till it is no longer about nothing but money, money, money. When the game is turned back into an actual game, then I will start recommending it again. Though, till new management is brought in, or the management they now have will stop focusing on money, and make the game fun, I can't see that happening.",Mon Jun 14 21:46:52 EEST 2021,51d4b321-880b-4c8d-bf67-fae3425b5d5b

[/h1]nNot saying you will, just my 2 cents.nnThe graphics and and music are exceptional, even on low budget desktops. Also, the puzzles are interesting and hard enough to make you stop and think. However...nnThe gameplay feels straight up worse than the 2013 title. Almost every single death I had was due to Lara not grabbing a ledge or the camera trying to force me to look at something while i was spamming inputs, throwing me into a different direction all of a sudden. It did not feel smooth at all, sometimes I was guessing at where I had to go but the game did not allow any alternate pathing, just cheap death animations.nnThere are a lot of cutscenes in this game. Lots of them, some unskippable. I say this because the story lost me way before the half-way point. Let's be honest, it's an action game, take the story with a grain of salt and appreciate it as a means to create interesting scenarios. Except I feel like it takes itself way too serious here. The usual gameplay loop in these games consists of: Story, Exploration and Combat, not necessarily in that order but always altenating and overlapping throughout the game. The other two games, while having their own issues, always shined with a healthy mix of stealth combat, exploration and open combat between the story bits. In this game, it feels like the story is by far the main focus. This is a change I did not like at all.nFor example: [spoiler] A 5+ minute mourning cutscene because some NPC whose name I already forgot died. After Lara already killed hundreds with her own hands and thousands through her actions. Come on, at least let me skip it. [/spoiler]nnAlso I feel like there is too much random dialogue that may be well written, but contradicts their focus on the story. If important NPC guy wants me to hurry, why can I talk to him after he sends me off, and all of a sudden he speaks about his backstory and hopes and dreams as if nothing urgent is going on? I just talked to him because he had a marker above his head.nnI got the Definitive Edition on sale for 15€ and I really don't know if it's worth more than that. I think I finished the story in about 10 hours and I'm unlikely to spend much more time on the exploration. It was enough to quench the thirst for more Tomb Raider, but by no means worth the full release price",Mon Dec 27 21:56:14 EET 2021,33fc9839-7e2d-411e-9f82-2cc8582bcef1

It took nearly two years for me to get Grand Theft Auto V, I've only recently gotten Left 4 Dead 2, and I'm still trying to convince myself to get Spore. But after years of playing in the online virtual world ""Second Life"".. and having a lot of fun hanging out with Star Trek roleplayers in SL.. when this game was announced, well.. I went a little crazy.I pre-ordered a lifetime subscription. During beta. I can only speak to the game's features as a ""gold"" member.. but what I can say is that this game is pretty epic.. for what it's trying to be.I had very limited experience with MMO type games prior to STO. I've since learned that some of the 'failings' of my initial reactions to STO were just indemic to the whole MMO drama (flawed animations, no lip syncing to spoken cutscenes, combat that was rudimentary in some areas, or overly power based, etc).Once I got USED to what MMO's are like, I returned to STO, and to be honest, I really do love this game. The graphics are gorgeous, the ship and costume customization options are pretty amazing, and once I got used to all the various powers and systems and things, it can actually be a lot of fun. The story lines can be a little cheesy in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.. there's often a little sarcastic comedy thrown in that keeps doing throwbacks to the various series.The graphics for this game are what amaze me most tho. Every single screenshot I take, looks like something off the cover of a Star Trek novel. Whether it's a space shot, or a picture on an alien planet, walking around starfleet academy, or whatever. It is truly a lovely game.Honestly, if you love Star Trek, and you like MMO's, this game will probably be a great fit for you.And hey, it's free to play. Give it a try.

There is research to do with your officers, setting skill points for yourself and your officers as well as promoting them. There are joint effort missions like Borg invsions to beat. You have away missions on both ships and planets. You can explore the inside of your ship real time and interact with all department heads in each area plus your bridge crew. All ships are fully customizable from interiors to exterior colors. You get a free ship choice on each Rank level you make. All in all I am saying a good game and you really can accomplish a lot with the total free play. But I have to admit there are a few aspects that you might want to put a dime or two into it like for the lock box keys and increaseing your inventory size because you can loose some stuff once it is full and you forget to sell what you do not want. You can play dobble, drink at bars, interact with people on planets and many star systems to explore. And missions are easy to find and get tossed at you often. All I can say is try it out for free see how you like it and then go from there.",Wed Jan 19 07:21:16 EET 2022,645c4ad3-b9ca-428c-aa34-295f4c6e4ebc

This game may have become...lost in the sands of time, but it is still one of of the best adventure games you can play. It is definitely showing its age but upon its release it changed the direction of the video game industry. It's smart design decisions, style, story, and mechanics can still be seen echoing around in the games that release even today. nn- It created a new form of ""platforming""n- Its gameplay mechanics and story fit hand in handn- Its storytelling is done in a unique and natural wayn- It isn't full of padding like most games released todayn- The story is a ""romance"" both in the traditional sense and our modern perception of the wordnnIt's age shows the most in the combat. While still very playable and enjoyable, the enemy AI tends to gang up on the player, leaving them very little room to maneuver and use the tools the game gives them. Also, the camera and the way the Prince soft locks onto targets leaves a lot to be desired. These issues were common and ""normal"" in games of its generation though. In fact, I'd argue they weren't originally viewed as problems at all. But today, with the advancements in combat mechanics seen over multiple generations of games, it is hard not to look back and judge this game a bit more harshly that it probably deserves. nnPoP: Sands of Time stands on its own with a beautiful beginning and ending. Although the sequels are good in their own right (and very different in tone), it is safe to say that this first entry can be played by itself or with them as a trilogy.nnSide note: I played this recently on Windows 11 and this game has never been updated for modern machines. There are some good guides to fix some common issues available here on Steam. The only issue I was unable to fix was some low dialogue audio during gameplay.

Two years ago the game used to be simple and smart, the combat mechanics were easy to learn and you could become a master in several ways. Spending real money wasn't necessary if you were playing at least once per day.Then, this perfection started to slowly fade: they released lock-boxes (another pay to win way to obtain the best ships), significantly increased the costs of equipment, introduced tons of bugs (some fixed, but not all) and released new P2W stuff like rain. Moreover, they completely ruined PvP (actually, Devs never cared about PvP, now is unplayable) and, above all, made Engineers and Scientists useless, or at least much lower than Tacticians, since the only thing that currently matters is DPS.I'm Leader of a good Federation fleet, 100% Free To Play (yes, I haven't spent money for it yet, but it's extremely hard) and currently a better player than 99,999% of the community.

While most that have bad releases generally die off after a short period of time, not only has Star Trek Online survived for years, its become a wildly successful MMORPG... and for very good reason. Of all the Star Trek being produced right now, this game risks to cover a period of time that nobody else seems to want to touch anymore: The Future, several decades after the events of Star Trek Nemesis and Deep Space Nine.  I am a massive Star Trek fan. This has made a lot of the single-player games to be very lack-luster to me since most of them force you into a specific role and generally its one of an action hero, something that is contrary to what Star Trek was supposed to be. Other then the adventure games like 'A Final Unity', '25th Anniversary' and 'Judgement Rites', most Star Trek games completely miss the spirit of the show. This game, while having a definite focus on combat, breaks up the fighting with numerous other mini-games, tasks, and puzzles. You can send out crew on away missions, once you hit higher levels and become an Admiral you can send out ships you originally commanded on missions, you can go mining for dilithium, pick up daily missions, work on your reputation with different factions, patrol worlds that aren't even part of a quest, or even play content created by other players and deemed good enough to be placed in-game. If I were to compare this to AAA titles like World of WarCraft I would have to give it and advantage in the sheer number of things you can do to keep the game feeling fun.  Gameplay works very well, especially in space. The ships handle like they should, the weapons are exactly the way they should be, and the powers all seem like they have a place. The graphics are very high-end but can be edited around so you can run the game on lower-tier systems.  I would be amiss if I didn't mention the best part of this game, and that is customization. Hair, facial structure, species, body proportions are all fully customizable, especially if you choose to make a custom alien species! Uniforms are available from every single era of Star Trek including the future uniforms and alternate universe uniforms if you want to spend a couple bucks. You are able to command every single starship made popular by the Star Trek series, from the original Enterprise to the USS Defiant. Some special ships are available as well which only appeared in a single episode like the Prometheus-Class, or the Dauntless. Variations on ships are available as well like the Saratoga version of the Miranda-Class seen in the first episode of Deep Space Nine. A painstaking amount of effort was made to allow players to utilize any ship they wanted, even having ways of using a Constitution Class in the end-game. Of course, when you see the ships designed by the STO team as Starfleets newest vessels you may not want to bother with the original ships since the new designs are exemplary. Most of these ships act as updated versions of earlier ships like the Resolute-Class being a modern overhaul of the Excelsior-Class. There are a few which are completely unique and its obvious the team loves Star Trek because they are faithful to Star Trek while still looking suitably advanced.   Ship Equipment is another way you can customize this game. Their are numerous weapon styles based on the ones seen in the series. Phasers, Disruptors, Plasma, Tetryon, and many more different forms of weaponry all pertaining to even the more obscure species, plus combinations of these different types and special weapons you find along the way, like the Klingon ""Hargh'peng"" Doomsday Weapon killing torpedo. Almost every part of your ship can be upgraded and enhanced, sometimes with interesting visual effects on the ship which can be turned on or off.  I mentioned the crew before but a quick blurb on them is appropriate since they are also completely customizable. You may not get what you want at the start but over time of finding bridge officers and customizing them you eventually will have a ship full of characters you designed yourself, in the positions you want them in.  If my massive gush-fest wasn't enough to say so: In this game, if you cannot find a combination of uniform/ship/crew that makes you happy, you either aren't looking hard enough or you aren't really interested in Star Trek.  The sound is all spot on and its fun to play a captain from the 'Original Series' era because a lot of the effects and sounds are replaced to reflect the more classic style. Much effort has been made to make sure the immersion is perfect, with little touches like the Klingons, Federation, and Romulans having different transport effects. Overall, the attention to detail is impressive and helps make the whole game feel polished. It doesn't hurt that they keep pulling in cast members from the series to voice act their characters in-game. Characters like Geordi La Forge, Worf, the Doctor, Seven of Nine, and numerous others all make an appearance, reprised by their respective actors. It all helps make the game feel that much more authentic.  ON THE OTHER HAND!   Star Trek Online's theme song is suitably heroic and sounds sufficiently 'Star Trek' but the few other songs in the game tend to repeat, making it a little annoying after a while of hearing the same song from Vulcan playing while you are fighting Borg on a damaged Cube. So the music is a low point in this game.   Additionally there are still some graphical glitches that come up, and the ground combat is generally annoying. It is still a sight better then when the game first came out but its like upgrading from a Shark latched onto your leg to a Piranha latched onto your butt. One isn't quite as bad as the other but its still not very pleasent.  There are micro-transactions which can be used to purchase additional ships, appearances, crew members, officers, etc. If you don't mind a little hard work you can get the micro-transaction currency through the in-game resource 'Dilithium'. Not that you really need to buy additional customization because there is already so many options its mind-boggling. While I am not too worried about the transactions I know many people don't like them. Pricing can be pretty varried. This may have something to do with the Dilithium system and the team not wanting to make it easy to get entire ships through in-game grinding, but it can be annoying at times. Entire costume packs consisting of numerous extra appearance options can cost a very reasonable $5.50 USD, but a top-tier ship (T6) generally costs $30.00 USD which can get really pricy. Thankfully once you get one T6 ship you generally are set to go on ships for the forseeable future, you just have to start with upgrading the ship equipment.  In conclusion, it's a fantastic MMORPG that keeps getting updates and keeps getting better. If you are a Star Trek fan and want to command your own ship there is no reason to not play this at least a bit.",Mon Apr 19 09:26:39 EEST 2021,d6bc84e9-44e9-4a45-9121-989088087e01

It could have been really great and I really believe it was heading that way until PWE got their hands on it. It's nothing more than a cash-grabbing MMO which is feeding off of Trek fans that have no other game to play. These people will say you don't need to spend money but you do when you get to end game. End game is nothing more than grinding a lame rep.system until a new episode comes out. And with every expansion comes a new rep.system to grind. Now CBS is forcing them to add Discovery content to help push this new Trek show which is a failure. This is what you have to look forward to in the game. Its fun while leveling but end game is really bad.,Sun Feb 06 14:52:32 EET 2022,f7d94b1e-0c78-449e-a409-9998e106a84c

I'd like to start by saying I absolutely love Star Trek, the very premise of the franchise, I love everything about it. I downloaded this game (after ages of being put off of it's 10GB installer, which is a valid reason I feel with terrible download speeds) and my word, I could not be more disapointed. I had hoped for another Bridge Commander with a few ""Mass Effect-equse"" battles. In reality, the ground combat is just awful, essentially pre Mass Efffect 1 combat, and we all know how bad that is. The space combat is similar to Bridge Commander, but nowhere near as fluid. The quests are literally pointless and only serve as a use to tell you to get around the very vast galaxy. The first few minutes are just laughable, the plot is completely unrealistic, even in a Sci-fi world. Sadly, the point I wanted to get to, PVP, with massive PEW PEW PEW space battles, wasn't obtainable. As you have to be a certain level to even have a hope of joining a lobby and then being able to actually survive the Pay-2-Win. Why on Earth they didn't just remake Bridge Commander I have no idea. That right there is a gold mine. After 6 hours of play, I could take no more and freed up some space on my HDD. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it just feels so outdated and unnatural to play. Hopefully they'll be a nice new Star Trek game out in the future.",Fri Jan 15 08:21:08 EET 2021,33bd17f8-19fc-43e7-9c22-5df289fb90cb

Minor connection hiccups that cause 1-2 second lag spikes in other games will cause this game to immediately drop its connection and force you back to the login screen, and often it will take several minutes and multiple attempts to reconnect.  Unless you have a top-tier, highly reliable internet connection, STO is simply unplayable outside of very limited off-peak hours.

Infact so much its not only unworthy of carrying the name Star Trek But Its got way to many issues that need desperate fixing.First off anyone thats getting connection issues. I agree That means Connection issues with some of the servers like the account server need to be resolved.Secondly Any maintanence ect. Shard maintanence being done needs more clear posting and further more Why do such a thing with the server up. Take the server down if your gonna do Maitanence damnit.And finaly whoever says this game needs a new Engine. They are right This game is in desperate need of a new engine and badly.Bottom line Cryptic you have let me down and a few other users down with your handling of this game you damn basterds.,Sat Jan 08 23:32:38 EET 2022,966b1047-95b1-4dcb-ac15-4720d181d1aa

After getting the game I was surprised how bad it was. Space combat was super tedious and slow, quests were all the same and everything was confined to small areas. How am I supposed to boldly go where no man has gone before when I'm confined to a small area like its an instance? If you've ever played the DnD MMO then you will know what I mean. It was the first MMO that I didn't play out the free month. They would have had to change pretty much the entire game for it to be good.

It's heaven for theorycrafters. Every so often however, Cryptic might release a new skill or item that makes one type of build the flavour of the month and in one case it can shadow all other builds, which are left in the dust.That's always the risk in a game where every class can access virtually every skill.The game merges two types of gameplays, the ground combat and the space combat. They work and feel different and you are able to concentrate only on one if you don't like the other. While levelling you might need to do a little bit of both, so depending on your tastes it might be either welcome variety or a minor annoyance, until you get to end game and are completely able to pick what kind of content you want to play.The ability to walk around your ship and starbases also allows plenty of opportunities for RP if you are into that. Talking of which the character costumisation in this game is on par with games such as Aion, if not better. The graphic style is not Asian, but when you can pick things like the length of your fingers, you know you can do almost anything.The game isn't necessarily pay to win, although items from the Zen store do have their advantages. If you have the time to grind, you can exchange in game currency for Zen (which you can buy with real cash) but the process is considerably slower.Overall Star Trek Online is an underrated game which has kept me busy for way more hours than most other MMOs I have played. In fact only one other MMO managed to beat it.",Wed May 06 14:18:27 EEST 2020,6fea946a-3f9d-4a00-b3f3-13f7cb5c0e1d

These include gameclient.exe errors, random crashes to desktop (without a report feature), crashes to desktop (which do trigger the report feature), disconnects, and memory leaks.In the 36 hours preceding this review, my client crashed out 23 times on an Asus 673JH-A1 with up-to-date drivers, making STO one of the buggiest games I've ever encountered. (This also takes the prize from Trion's ""Defiance,"" which gained quick post-launch notoriety for its bugs, glitches, and other game-breaking features.)Company technical support, or lack thereof, complicates the picture. Cryptic is known by this point as ""Chronic"" due to their persistent inability to launch a major patch without breaking at least one major feature - leading to at least 2-5 subsequent patches to fix whatever was originally broken. Technical support is also nonexistent, meaning you're on your own for troubleshooting and support.In short, definitely would not recommend this game.Update: After not playing the game for about 4 months, I reinstalled it on a whim and was promptly met by 3 crashes in an hour. At this point I'm giving up. No game is worth this level of aggravation.",Sat Aug 01 15:45:47 EEST 2020,67dc1180-1a79-4f3c-aa26-a4ee1bb5e9ff

However, I think it is fair to say that I will lay down what I feel about this game in a rather fair form. For the longest time, there have not been many great attempts at recreating the Star Trek universe in a game. Some of the best Star Trek games I would argue; go back to the late 1990's and early 2000's; where Star Trek Armada, Klingon Academy, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force and Bridge Commander were some of the best titles. Later down the road; such as the mid to late 2000's, you had some titles but none were particularly worth playing. Star Trek Online comes around, and yes: The launch was dissapointing for many who expected it to be a in-depth Bridge Commander style game; not to mention other details seem to have went missing from the game. This is partially due to the collapse of Perpetual Entertainment and the acquisition and development over to Cryptic. The game originally was a monthly fee based game; but eventually it turned Free to Play. I played it for a while years ago but have since been convinced to pick it up and see how it is.I have to say, I am quite impressed with it. The game overall makes you feel like you are in charge of a ship and you even go under the sensation of living in the shoes of a captain; the amount of things to do and the quality of the mission narratives makes the game rather interesting and not so much a typical boring MMO. Pros:1. Free to Play system is fair. (There is purchase content, but it doesn't upset balance.)2. Customization galore. (Ships, uniforms, officers, loadouts, etc. Lots of cosmetic choices.)3. Solo friendly environment. (You don't need to be with others to succeed. You can team up; but the game doesn't require it.)4. Large Officer roster. (Bridge officers that can operate your ship's systems. Assign teams to go away on missions outside your ship.) 5. Space combat mechanics. (Want to focus shield energy on a given side? Want to increase power to weapons? You are in control.)6. Not a grindfest game. (Want to hit the level cap? This game doesn't make you spend countless hours of your life to get to that point.)7. Foundry missions. (User generated missions that have their own plot and objectives. They can vary in quality; but it is player freedom.)8. Star Trek MMO. (Star Trek fans like this. This is totally not obvious, right?)9. Mission types. (Not every mission involves combat or fighting, some are simple scan or repair missions.)10. Mission narrative. (Some missions make you think of yourself fulfilling the role in a Star Trek episode.)Cons:1. Player community. (It is a free to play game, so this is sort of expected. Players get too political sometimes and often immature. Sometimes it is difficult to make inquiries in chat, etc. Not everyone likes this kind of environment.)2. Enemy bosses. (This is more of a annoying trope than a real problem. Enemy bosses such as the ""villain"" type always seem to escape you.)3. Linear missions. (There are plenty of them that offer different solutions to a problem; but many missions don't have multiple outcomes.)4. Away team issues. (The away teams that you bring into combat will never try to revive you unless they are not fighting. Sometimes Away team members don't maintain unit coherency.)5. Some visuals. (Some planet textures on even the highest settings still look blocky and ugly.)6. Customer service. (The customer service is known to be on the poor side. Lack of sincerity and cooperation when issues arise in cases.)Overall, this MMO is definitely worth playing; even if you are not into Star Trek; the game itself is quite entertaining and full of things to do. There is a lot of purchase content; but it isn't required to actually succeed in playing and enjoying the game.",Sun Nov 15 20:33:59 EET 2020,81b3d464-d3f2-492a-b41b-55ae09745be3

Namely, I started playing it when it first launched (and it was a subscription based MMO). Cryptic did a good job, but to be honest, they launched it too early, and it felt like it was halfway done.  The Federation side had a good amount of content, but the Klingon faction, did not.  So after playing it for about a year, I took a break from it (a year plus break).  Coming back to it after so long, even after it went F2P and Cryptic was bought by Perfect World Entertainment, I must say, Cryptic has done an excellent job in expanding the universe.  Not only did they launch a third faction, the Romulans, they also fully fleshed out the Klingon faction.  They also updated the trait system, kit system, and R&D system, while continuing to create Featured Episodes.  That, along with a more robust Foundry (a system that let's the community create playable missions to share), I must say, I've gotten hooked on this game once again.",Mon Mar 01 06:50:56 EET 2021,8024dd3f-a277-4364-85ec-367d0034deef

And i have played since closed beta.)Overall quality of this game is bad. Ive been with this game since its beta and it was shipped unfinished to meet a contract deadline, they (the devs) admited this. Major problems from the beta are still present in the game now years later. devs barely update the game at all and when they do it normaly breaks it worse for a few months then it goes back to what it was before with like one spelling error fixed in one converation nobody reads anyway. The games ingame store makes the game pay to win, but all that money you are paying them they are not putting towards developing the game.  Feature episodes (their version of a tv show episode) which are kinda like mini events that move forwards the timel ine of the game and cost alot of dev time can most of the time out of a 6 weeks for 6 parts series be completed in 30 minutesabout 5 min for a part some of the parts are purely walls of text to read and complete in less then 2 min.Actual gameplay of this game is in a word repetative. Go here kill this. Go here collect this. Go here kill this to collect this. Completely missing the point of the story telling that was any of the TV shows, starfleet rarely uses lethal force or force at all to achieve there goals but thats all you do in this game. Once in a blue moon you come across an interesting quest line but most are sub par, literaly narrow hallways with the entrance on one end, 4 groups of enemies to kill and a conversation at the end. Time to max level in this game taeks about 4 to 6 weeks. Ground combat in this game is a joke it lacks anything to make it fun, boreing interiors for all but 6 missions. Space combat is not in much better shape but at least they spent time here usualy interesting looking locations but still repetative combat, enter mission - kill 4 groups - conversation - leave.Dev comepletely fail at understanding how to make a game. There are enemies in the game that have a 0% chance to miss you and deal 10 times your health and sheilds combined both in ground and space. This is to add ""challenge"" to the game when in reality they skimped out on making the game made it kill you so you would have to eather try again and hope you DPS it to death before it can react or you grind some repetative mission to crap xp to become higher level then the guy to go back through the whole mission again to kill him and continue the sub par story that you dont even remember why your in the same exact looking base killing another dude.While most of this game is complete crap they have at least done some interesting things to the cannon star trek story line and is at least worth playing for a month to get the story if your a star trek fan. And some of there latest content that last big update adding the delta quadrant is rather good story and gameplay wise they actualy broke there own molds for missions in this last update, the main enemy in these missions is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fight in space since it can one shot even the most tanky crusier you have with a massive nearly unavoidable AOE in space, but other then that its rather good. Also while this game is lacking in most areas it is a fun game to paly with friends. Also making your character in this game uses one of the best systems ive ever seen in a game you can control almost all aspects of your characters looks. The create your own missions portion of the game called the foundry is also an interesting idea and fun to do some times. More often then not the community comes up with better missions then the devs do.I do not recomment this game for anyone at this time, maybe in a few years it might be worth recommending to people but not at this time.",Fri Jul 09 16:38:06 EEST 2021,82736a5c-f7eb-4a4d-a62a-4213e76c4d5c

You don't need to actually use the said ship to use the trait, all you need is to buy it, then ""level"" the ship(which is quite fast if go somewhere where you can destroy many ships).3 - Every new ship can use one of the specializations(atm there are intelligence(incredibly strong), command and pilot), the old ones can't, and cryptic made it clear they never will be capable of using it, in other words if you're using old ships, you're locked out of new game content, isn't it amazing?Now for that exception, there is a ship called the scimitar, which is by far the best ship in the game due to the sheer amount of damage you can dish with it(which is kinda fair, since it was OP in the movies too), but make no mistake, cryptic has made it clear they intent on releasing every old iconic ship as a tier 6 version, so you can re-buy everything again(isn't it nice?), so its a matter of time till they re-release the scimitar.Cryptic also added ""crafting"" which is basically RNG-based gambling so you can get a weapon with the mods you wish, you also need to use it if you want take your weapon to highest tier, which is VERY costly, even more so if you're trying to get them to increase in rarity(unless you happen to be a bored billionaire from dubai or something, don't try to increase rarity, its stupid).So to summarize, cryptic took a game with a booming population, which had a very casual, forgiving and fun playstyle, and turned into a boring grindfest, outright lied to the playerbase, and refuse to fix it, even though the population continues to drop as a direct result of said changes. Cryptic has been trying desperately to reverse this by doing everything BUT reversing/improving on what they did, its not working and it will not work, because in the end, the game is still boring.My recommendation? stay the hell away from this thing, if you insist on playing this trainwreck, be a romulan tactical captain aligned with the klingons, get a scimitar and the 1000 zen nausicaan ship of the klingon side, it will give you the best console in the game, the plasmonic leech, you don't need anything else.I'll change this review if cryptic fixes those issues... which i seriously doubt will happen.",Wed Nov 18 01:31:42 EET 2020,d1c4afb0-53b9-40cd-b81c-5d2358822f95

A lot more time-constraint missions that force you to play in a different way compare to EU. I love this kind of time pressure and I am thrilled when I clutch the hack/disarm/saving civilian at the very last moment, kudo to this.nn2.Distinction of class tree compare to EU. There are now names for the different tree you could go, you can mix and match, or just going straight down one tree. Even though there are a few ones that feel like a complete ""should-avoid"" or weaker in general, I feel like you get more choice to pairing your skills through out the tree. Also the AWC gifting the soldier random skills is also a great aspect.nn3. Reworked class played out really smoothly. EU's classes definition are great, dont get me wrong. But, the changes they made, provides alot more routes you can approach a situation. Take Ranger for example, before I used Assault more like an aggressive assassin/brawler, Run&Gun in to scout or take out VIP immediately. Now with Ranger I would need to think about how to fully utilize the scout potential that this class could bring while retaining its assassin capability. Given Squad Sight and pistol overwatch on start to Sharpshooter also make the class feel more flexible, more engaging with the squad in my opinion.nn4. To be frank, I did not like dodge that much at first when I encountered this mechanic. But, the more I play, the more I feel that it was a good addition to the game. It is not longer 0 or 1 like in EU, and I actually kind of like this. Dodge provided more variable to the RNG aspect, and I, as a slave to RNG, cannot resist the sudden rush of adrenaline when I see a Chryssalid or a Stun Lancer had three dodge in a roll. Also it forces me to quickly react to a was-good situation when the original plan did not go well.nnMight add more when I buy WotC cause I have heard it is a complete different game when bought, but thats all for now",Sun Oct 03 09:58:25 EEST 2021,26582459-1463-4755-80cf-aff5d1e6c890

The second game takes place on a collony, where the worldbuilding is slightly better than the first, more detailed and thought about telling a story. The story is about the same quality but characters got more voicelines, including Isaac the character you play as.nThe Atmosphere however does get downgraded a bit, with a lot more action and sounds that break immersion from the ''silent'' and dark vibe that the first game gives. You dont get moments of almost complete silence where you feel alone, nearly as much as the first game.nnThe part that is the most different from the first game, is the combat. Where the first game spawns enemies in locations where the player can always deal with them, with different weapons or loadouts. Where even if the spaces were small or tight, you always had control over the combat. Deadspace#2 is almost the complete opposite when it comes to combat, and it often drops enemies on top of you, stunning or damaging you in the process. As enemies are predetermined to spawn in certain locations that the player might be at, or in some cases will be at. From enemies dropping on top of you, while in an elevator, or from a ceiling vent. To enemies that pile up at certain locations, making it imposible to fight them unless you are in the right location to do so.nThis often results in taking unpreventable damage, or in some cases being stunlocked and dying. Unless you already know where the enemies will spawn and got the right tactic to counter them, you might not always be able to deal with every encounter and just die because you ''did not know what was comming''. nThis is hugely immersion breaking, especialy on higher dificulties. I would recommend playing the game on normal dificulty, so the combat does not take away from the experience as much.nn[b]The Good[/b]n- Amazing world buildingn- Great Storyn- Great voiceactors/voicelinesn- Good sound designnn[b]Neutral[/b]n- Slightly less atmospheric, due to its setting and sound designn- More action focusedn- DLC are unlocked (some disagreement between EA and Steam) and accessible at the first ingame store even if you have not bought any DLC. It contains every weapon and some armor suits, that might or might not give minor bonuses. This is fun for some, but can break immersion for others.nn[b]The Bad[/b]n- Combat and enemy spawns is a large downgrade from the first game.n- Weapons dont always fire (this might be a bug but a consistent one, or to make the game harder)nn[b]Conclusion/should you buy it?[/b]nDeadspace 2 is a solid game in the series, even with the problems it has in combat. Where the first game was a masterpiece for most players, Deadspace 2 does feel a lot less good, until you compare it to other similar games. The story builds onto the first game realy well, and its worth playing.nIf you loved the first game, then I am sure you will like this game as well. Although I would not recommend playing it on higher dificulties.nIf you liked the first game but are not too sure about other games in this series, buy it at a discount.nPlaytime is about 10-14 hours to complete it",Thu Mar 04 08:47:21 EET 2021,6cbe2f52-a722-4d6e-b286-db2a79cc3b37

I would recommend using this patch - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451nn[h1] Looks and sound [/h1] nThis Game has not aged well in terms of graphics. The lighting is fine but the textures are pretty old and there was never anything striking about the art direction. In general I find that 3D games don't age well. I do like the way the game mixed the traditional CRPG gameplay with an action-RPG control scheme and letting the player look around the area instead of always being in the isometric perspective.nnThe soundtrack though has stood the test of time for me. It was composed by Inon Zur who is known for his work on the Fallout games and Pathfinder Kingmaker. The music fits well with the general tone of the game and there's a good variety of combat music to stop it from feeling stale.nn[h1] Combat [/h1] nI've played a bunch of games with RTWP in the past few years and I think this is so far my favorite one. I'm not sure what about it made me enjoy it more than Pillars or Pathfinder. It could be how the character progression and subclasses are easier to grasp while still carrying a good amount of variety or the fact that I don't have to rest after fights for spell uses. I played a mage and this game pretty much exemplifies the trope of 'linear warriors and quadrilateral wizards'. I felt exceptionally limited at the start compared to my party members but by the end I was drowning in variety and versatility. This game has a lot of sublasses, called specializations and they can change your build a lot. I mostly played a traditional wizard for the player character but I had a fighter-templer, a shapeshifter-wizard and a healer-wizard which gave a lot of choices in how to tweak my party setup.nnThe game is surprisingly well balanced for the most part other than one fight in the main questline. Even the optional bosses which looked harder weren't too much for a new player like me to handle on normal difficulty.nn[h1]Story and Worldbuilding[/h1]nThe story follows a Grey Warden who has to stop a horde of evil creatures, the darkspawn from taking over the nation of Ferelden. The quests mostly have the player going to different locations and convincing the local leaders to assist the grey wardens in fighting the threat. It's a simple but effective message of how some squabbles can be meaningless in the face of a threat which requires mass co-operation. Each leader is facing their own set of issues and is located in a separate part of the map where there a lot of different questlines set up. There's a pretty good variety of choices with different outcomes which can be affected by one's race, build and stats.nnThe companions of this game range from a knight Templar grey warden, a shapeshifter rogue mage, a failed assassin, a healer mage, a warrior from a vastly different culture and some others. There's a good enough variety in terms of character and classes for companions. DAO manages to keep companions active in the game by having them react to your decisions with positive or negative reputations along with personal questlines which often depend on those reputations.nnThe Worldbuilding of Dragon Age takes inspiration from the Blight of the Wheel of Time and Morder from Lord of the Rings but it's not a simple copy paste. There's a surprising amount of thought and detail behind the darkspawn in the setting and how the Grey Wardens are entwined with them. In general it feels like the writers really asked the logical questions to introducing certain concepts and then applied that to the world. This sounds simple but requires a lot of planning and it's really satisfying to see how everything sort of clicks and makes sense. The way mages are treated and behave is one such example. It makes sense that people with such destructive potential who are also prone to being possessed would be feared and reviled while at the same time needed for certain purposes.nnnOverall I recommend this game to anyone who likes story based fantasy games, is looking to get into CRPGs or wanting to try RTWP(real time with pause) gameplay.nnI will be making a seperate review for the Awakening DLC which I think is massive enough to warrant a seperate version but the short version would be that it's good and you should get it too or just get the ultimate edition",Thu Feb 10 02:56:54 EET 2022,34dc6468-23d7-415f-8f56-ba9ed586daef

The crafting system is fun and also the Officer missions. You can send your crew to get recources for you or even different currencies you can spend for equipment. The stories are really cool and I can recommend the Missions which take you back in time to experience old star trek episodes. I recently joined again to see what changed. They implemented a lot of new features, quests and events so a PvE player might be very satisfied BUT if you are looking for PvP you should look elsewhere. The entire game changed from different fighting factions to a bunch of excel sheet reading damage maximizing grannys in pink pyjamas. They only maximize their gear to get better gear and to sit in their space stations dreaming of big fights which will never happen as nobody ever plays any PvP. So if you look for a complex game with seasonal events and story you are at the right place but you will never use your gear in player combat ever again. So even if I have a lifetime abbonement I will not bother downloading the game again.

No i em not! waste of time and money. its more of a Trekie Trap, once you buyin to the game you need to have it all, like most trekies want all. i probably gonna get alot of flack for this but it is true.(BTW: steam says i play aprox 66hours, it is wrong i played well over that number)",Thu Dec 03 05:32:34 EET 2020,502a1191-07f2-44be-98f3-9c696ae5d0d8

The base game is fun, and worth exploring if you are a Star Trek fan but as you progress to end game more and more of the content will be locked behind a paywal till eventually your reach a point where you will be simply inferior to someone who has dropped cash, from a little to a lot, to improve his or her ship or crew.

They turn a blind eye to feedback from the playerbase. On the forums topics are being locked that provide negative feedback about the game. They only focuss on filling their own wallet's. They keep adding broken content and the amount of bugs keeps getting bigger. They fix 1 bug? 10 new bugs appear to replace the one they fixed. Their hardware is crap. Everyone gets disconnected from the game every few hours due to ""server not responding"". Yet the developers keep saying everything is working as intended and that the problem always lies on the side of the customers.The 5 year anniversary is the latest example of Cryptic's incompetence. The first 48 hours after the 5 year anniversary launch the game was unplayable because of the high amount of players logging into the game at the same time. What was the developer team's response? They told us to wait 2-3 days until everyone has finished patching their clients. Yet again this new content is filled with bugs and some of it isn't even playable because missions can't be completed.I have never, ever seen an MMO go downhill as badly as Star Trek Online. MMO's are supposed to be stable due to the high amount of players playing the game. But with Cryptic? With them: ""everything is working as intended"". I'm a big fan of Star Trek, and this game is the closest thing a Star Trek fan can have to an MMO representing the Star Trek universe. But it all gets ruined by a company that is only interested in filling their own pockets. I have endured this mess long enough. But enough is enough.If you are curious about the game but not familiar with the world of Star Trek, It's not worth it.

After all, I never got that far because tech support was unable to answer a simple query concerning which domains to whitelist (other than perfectworld.com) in order to get it running on a secure system. Let's start from the beginning:.My system is specially set up so that JavaScript, etc.,  runs correctly on my system only when served from a whitelisted domain. From any other domain it gets shut down - which is how I know that STO is served, in part, from unspecified domains other than perfectworld.com and these other domains are, consequently, not whitelisted by my security. .What takes the cake is that, when I asked tech support for the domain names which needed to be whitelisted for the game to work, they responded by stating that the game works for “millions” of other people - which dodged the question by employing an argument by irrelevance; a form of sophistry known as a fallacy. I have to wonder if these guys even bothered to read the support ticket I lodged (given their total failure to comprehend the problem I raised) and why they couldn't simply address my question (as opposed to addressing some purely imaginary complaint).  .Now, when support techs start engaging in sophistry, it can mean that they are more interested in griefing the customers than doing their job. Moreover, this reflects very poorly on management, for obvious reasons; principally because it demonstrates the attitude that they can do no wrong and it is always someone-else's fault which, ultimately, gives rise to a fundamental disrespect for the customer base..The bottom line is that I recommend strongly against STO and, moreover, I will not be reviewing this game again until I see some sort of evidence that key management changes have been made which facilitate policy implementation designed to ensure that customers are not systematically marginalised for the apparent crime of asking for some technical support.",Fri Jul 16 05:28:32 EEST 2021,b0fab19b-fd01-468e-ba8a-88a7ed3d4e19

I have played shooters all my life, grew up with the PS2 and PS3, and never touched true CRPGs like the original FO games until 4 months ago. Everything that made FO1 great (despite it's imperfections) is here, but far more detailed, expansive, and humorous in a way that is so hilarious yet offensive that it is crazy to imagine they were even put in here. Seriously, there are parts in this game that feel like Lloyd Kaufman wrote it. Somehow, it is able to juggle the humor along with the serious elements. People act like 1 is the bleakest game, which tonally I'd say is true, but the stuff in 2 is arguably darker. Slavery everywhere, drug overdosing in most places, prostitution, child murder, etc. The amount of world building here is literally God tier. Corruption even in the most ""peaceful"" places. The ambiguity of morality. The music of 1 helping sustain this toxic atmosphere, while adding in my view some of the best tracks Mark Morgan ever graced us with. My God. This thing is an absolute monster. nnMy journey with Fallout started with New Vegas roughly a year ago, which is an awesome RPG that helped me become obsessed with the franchise. Instead of going after 3 and 4, I decided to try the classics. I had difficulty with the first game, not simply for its infancy in terms of old mechanics (which it would improve in the sequel), but it's rough pacing in the first segments of the game. Not the most detailed areas, despite the great characters, wonderful atmosphere, and truly epic story ending. I love how overtly dark it is compared to the rest of the series, and I feel that pure tone has never been caught since. It is truly the saddest Fallout game. Period. nnYou think NV had a bad development period? Fallout 2 was made in [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2#:~:text=According%20to%20co-founder%20of,to%20make%20the%20whole%20game"".] 9 months [/url].. I can't imagine how they were able to accomplish so much despite that clearly rushed time period. The improvements it makes from Fallout 1 are not just mechanics. It's not just that companions are better (AI still wacky, don't let Marcus use a minigun lmao, but there is more control) or how you can move NPCs now. Dialogue is significantly better. Choices are significantly better. The story is imo overall just amazing, as good as the original if not better for me. Never in my life would I think that playing a porn star would look so FUN in a game. The characters, despite my true love for the Master and Set, are just better. Sulik, Marcus, Myron (yes, Myron), Sargent Dornan, etc. etc. Freaking Frank Horrigan. The inverseness of this game story wise is a wonderful development off of Fallout 1. God I just love this game I cannot stand it. Don't even get me started on the cut content like the [url=https://www.nma-fallout.com/threads/rainbow-confederation-encounter.160524/] Rainbow Confederation [/url] or the freaking original [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Childkiller?file=Child_Killer.png] Child Killer Reputation [/url] artwork. It's amazing in how more mature this game is compared to later titles. nn[h1]Tips for New Players[/h1]nnIf anything, I'd recommend anyone who has the patience to try older titles and games to give this a shot. Part of me wonders if people should start with 2 and then go for 1, but I also feel my experience with 1 was invaluable to me being able to ""jump into"" 2 without much problems. There are a few tips I want to give to those wanting to play that helped me play the game: nn[b]1)[/b] Save often. I don't mean ""save every 10-15 minutes."" I mean have several saves, a quicksave, every time you are about to get into combat, when you are going through a building fighting people save every time combat ends, etc. Save save save. It will save you a lot of pain. nn[b]2)[/b] If you are new, just follow the big quest stuff that gives you hints. Talk to everyone, think about the context of FO1 lore, look and loot places. In the Klamneth? Loot around near where the rats are, particularly a broken car to the east in that area. Saved Vic? Look in his inventory, what's that he's got there? Know how to loot. Make sure, because it's not always clear, to look around the room *carefully.* I straight up missed holes in the ground because walls blocked them, or didn't realize in places like New Reno that some staircases (Mordino Family for example) also go downstairs. Etc etc. I could probably think of hundreds of more, but these are good enough I think. nn[b]3)[/b] Understand the city map system. When you go to a town, it gives you options of where to go within it. Sometimes you may park your Highwayman and think it got stolen (again >:]) but really you just parked it in a different spot in town. Some places you need to look at the whole city map in order to travel to that specific spot. Just be aware of that. When in doubt, exit the area. Also, make sure you explored the whole face of the sections of town you are in. Lowkey missed the Poseidon Powerplant in Gecko simply because I didn't move my view all the way to the right lol. nn[b]4)[/b] Bugs. Honestly, I think I've had more crashes with FO3 lol, but 2 as well as the 1 can crash. Bugs suck and the game only has a few annoying ones (randomly slows down for no reason for a bit, screen blackens and clears up as you move your cursor around, etc.), but ONE in particular is real bad. There is a game breaking bug if you aren't careful. It's not exactly clear what the bug is or where it comes from, but many people call it the ""Too Many Items"" bug. Essentially, at a certain point, whenever you go into Chinatown in San Francisco, the game will crash every time. This is one of the many reasons multiple saves is very important. I was able to be in Chinatown a lot, but supposedly the bug occurs when you put too many items in the trunk of your Highwayman (yeah, that car ALSO has a trunk. I found that out by accident after using it for 5 hours LOL). You can still access the Tanker, but the moment you there, or anywhere else in the city, you have to go through Chinatown to leave, which will result in a crash. It makes your next trip into SF a one way trip. nnIf you are curious about the bug, I played this game raw (no mods) and it seems like some like the Restoration Mod fixed it? It's not super clear tho. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/38410/discussions/0/1698293703771299385/] This person [/url] was able to figure it out on their own (read the comments too). Check out the [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/User:Porter21/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide#The_too_many_items_bug] fallout wiki [/url] for more info too. nn[b]5)[/b] Lastly, I'll say this because I think it's good for anyone who's new nn[h1] Closing Statement [/h1] nnBasically, it's an awesome game for the main story, fun and serious side quests, and characters. NV is really good, but I think that 2 is the true masterpiece of the series. It is the game the future franchise built itself off of, for better or worse. I have not played a lot of video games in my life, but I think I understand the love here. I love it to death too. Truly a CLASSIC. nn[b] 10 / 10 [/b]nn[i] ""As for the tanker vagrants...well, as vagrants do...they drifted on~""[/i]nnhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soF3t7cFPo",Fri Apr 17 03:15:03 EEST 2020,5252aa81-537f-45e1-bb75-bba79c67536f

First of all there is immersion-breaking pop in with characters, entities, special effects, and entire scenes. What I'm talking about here is when the screen transitions from one scene into another it doesn't allow all of the entities to load before coming in from black. So you're frequently left watching strange pop-in with stuff. There are also numerous control-specific things that just feel... off... like clicking over and over to attack, instead of being able to just hold down the button, to give one example. It is a great looking game, and worth the price of admision (it is free after all) but I wouldn't really recommend it as something worth spending any significant amount of time playing.",Sun Apr 04 05:22:34 EEST 2021,34ec5303-4a14-42b7-8605-4bb28c497369

Quests also suffer from constant bugs one way or another, sometimes even progress stopping bugs.Graphics wise it's outdated, which is not entirely a bad thing, but is paired with terrible acting and direction in cinematics, giving it some below amateur feeling that you can't wash off.And last but not least, the user interface is more of a bother than a help. Things like huge symbols in minimap that simply wont let you see what you are suposed to see, to everything looking pretty much the same and thus making it harder to even understand them, or weird design choices like not giving a more direct approach to equiping kit abilities, having to realize on your own that you are suposed to try random keys until you get P and see a selection of avaliable skills.Basically, if you can skip this entirely you won't regret it, it doesn't get any better as you progress, it only gets worse.",Sun Jan 24 14:54:31 EET 2021,8124c0f8-bd1d-4f4f-9dd9-94ee19e9da83

All of them. Avoiding combat, alternate solutions to the tasks at hand, using technobabble to get out of a tough situation are not here - You rarely even get fetch quests for most of the storyline as the game reduces you to ""go there, kill everything"".And to add insult to injury, the post-scarcity world of Star Trek has seemingly been taken over by the Ferengi. Not only is there a player economy based on ""energy credits"", but a multitude of currencies including ore you mine with a daily cap for refinement, premium currency Zen, Ferengi Lobi Crystals and many many more.Now all of this would be bad but okay if the game offered any kind of depth or fun gameplay, but instead it sadly can't even hold up to the lowest of Korean grinding MMO standards.

Explore new systems, sign treaties and decimate your enemies while piloting your favorite ships from series and customizing them to your own accord.

Movement can feel clunky. Animations are sort of stiff. Sometimes the lag monster can really bite you. Even though getting to max level isn't bad, the reputation grind can be. The store isn't the worst, but its obvious that if you want cool things, you are going to have to dish out $5 here, $10 there. Unfortunately, there are premium ships that come with modules that you can only get that way, so for PVP this translates to pay-to-win.The stuff I like: The space combat is fun and it does feel like to you captaining a ship. The 'dungeons' (STFs) are kind of neat and its cool how they made space combat bosses. It's also a solid MMO to play casually without any of the big spenders getting in your way. You won't feel left out by not paying for things in the game as the only content you will be locked out of are certain premium ships (and their special universal modules).I would recommend this is you like Star Trek and are looking for this sort of game.",Tue Dec 28 07:44:47 EET 2021,4a683726-2a70-4e4e-b464-e45ffa1127e3

While the game is a great game one of the biggest down sides that caused me to stop playing the game is the constant grind to level up just so you can play the next story driven mission.  Sure it is easy to level up but it just gets old doing the same thing over and over again just to get to some new content.  The game when I came to it wasnt too bad but with the release of the fleet bases the game became a very huge dilithium sink which is now starting to level off some as dilithium values have dropped as majority of people have already finished their bases.I do recommend this game because you can put many hours in it but be warned you will have to do a grind to get to some stories as the story missions do not provide enough XP to level up from one story to the next.,Tue Jul 14 11:25:04 EEST 2020,c4e41db4-e7b4-4a8a-874a-64e20ebe451a

MY BIG ISSUES WITH THE GAME:at the end of the game there is a large ""pay to win"" element that will most likely irrtate most players that play the game. also toward end game ship  customisation becomes less and less until there is none(or next to none).

Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.",Fri Feb 21 22:47:54 EET 2020,fbed753b-834c-4ca3-b7fb-8754d8d7a37f

There are also lots of references to all the series and movies e.g. Sisko's baseball in his office on DS9. It also ties up some loose ends and explains things that were unclear in the franchise e.g. the Temporal Cold War or the Iconians. Some might argue that it's ""pay to win"", but that isn't true, because you can get equipment that can hold up with premium items at events and also earn the premium currency in-game. I definitely recommend trying out this game to anyone who likes Star Trek or sci-fi in general.",Thu Jan 14 22:06:02 EET 2021,e44bf00e-9fde-463e-8887-430e617ff471

It looks brilliant, it feels rather solid and you'll have a blast with it.It's set many years after the events of The Next Generation (Picard, Sisko, Janeway if you have any idea about Star Trek).The uniforms in this era look like Latex crap, but you can wear late uniforms from First Contact and customise how you look.Also this game/MMO absolutely craps all over Star Trek and everything it stands for.

Such as more inventory space for free, and bank space. We are currently in Season 9.5 A New Accord. The .5 generally brings some modifications to game performance and what not. We should expect some new things, in Season 10. For now however, I have been exploring the STO Universe, making new friends, discovering new things, and more! I still do greatly recommend the game, for newcomers to STO, you guys get an updated Tutorial :3, but have fun, and never give up!*REVIEW POST UPDATE 4/6/2014 1:12 PM (PST)*The game has greatly improved over the past year that I had been playing it. Although, the Dyson Sphere can use some work, as there is a huge bug where the ground below you spazzes out, but other than that, a very great game. You might see other people that are Vice Admiral(Level 50 [Max Player Level]) and might make fun of you or something related, just ignore them. There are very few Vice Admirals' out there that would help newcomers into the STO Universe. I became one of these people and help any newcomer that I see that is in trouble, when it comes to a mission, friendly stroll in Sector Space, or some casual talk. I think every newcomer into the STO Universe, should remember one thing, Never give up. What you see there, was something I learned when ranking up within STO. If you need any help, low level or not, you can always message me In-Game(If online), or send me a Friend Request through Steam, message me and I will get back to you ASAP. I really care to help out newcomers into the STO Universe, it's a really fun and addicting game. So just download the game, and come on and join us!",Wed Dec 08 21:33:12 EET 2021,b0fab19b-fd01-468e-ba8a-88a7ed3d4e19

No, the real frontier awaiting exploration is the vast array of choices you can make, from designing a ship & character, to changing your destined route through different verbiage or a vernacular of missions peering through an almost unveiled veneer of polished textures on older models.Now, to start the real review it goes without mentioning that the user interface is hectic and as a UI designer I would love to be part of the team that built it so I can fix foolish placement and bad design. Not being an option the next best route is the tutorial, which explains the nuances displayed by most of the engine, leaving your curiosity to work out the quirks without making the player feel dumb. One piece of the game that is certainly lacking though is the ship combat controls which can be hard to maneuver when there is more than one enemy, having to disengage and focus on fighting but move far enough away as not to be affected by the blast of a destroyed enemy vessel.I would like to see this game receive a new launcher, some improvements to its UI, and polished cut scenes made on the current version of the engine before it receives an overtly high score, but I feel it's deserving of something above the middle ground as not only does this game try to draw you in, holding you hostage in tense battles for hours at a time, but it also returns a nostalgic feeling, one I last felt on the launch of Old School Runescape and a feeling I long to continue experiencing as I delve full time fervently further into the fabric of ths formerly forecasted foothold, frequented by funny but frustrated friendly men seemingly of fraternity fraudulentity.

I'm not one that really does the whole grouping and playing with others online and I don't belong to a guild or anything but even playing it as a single-player game is fine. Every now and then I may join a group mission and take on the Borg or what have you but the choice of races (Federation, Klingon, and Romulan) and different starting stories are really well done. Some missions seem to cross-over to the different races but there are some unique missions for each race as well. If you are a fan of any of the television series' then there is something here for you as all are respresented: TOS,TNG,DS9,VOY,ENT and that is a good thing. The gameplay is darn good and it look nice at max settings but nothing to compete with AAA titles. The ground misisons are fun and the space battles are awesome. The misisons are set about like episodes from the television series and there seems to be so much to do and there is variation depending on your race.You can upgrade your ships and get better ships as well  as your equipment for ground based misisons. I think if the game had a little more polish on the UI and the graphics/animation department this could be in the running to be the best MMORPG out there but as it is F2P you really should give it a shot.

While it is missing some essential characters such as Kirk or Spock, the impeccable voice acting and character emotion is amazing.

The combat is fluent and the dialogue is near-perfect.However, there are only two things wrong, small things, but non the less they are essential. The frist point being my character has no voice and for such a star studded audio presentation it deterierates into laughable situations where it's a very serious moment, everybody panicing and there's me, stood there, emotionless and voiceless.My second and final complaint it the ship.

Though it suffered from a difficult start and bumps along the way, the game has continued to evolve and grow. The PvE aspect of the game has become expansive and can seem a bit overwhelming at times for new players. With so many systems integrated over the years from Duty officer missions and abilities, Reputations systems, countless gearsets/combinations, greatly improved crafting system finally in place, and of course the missions both official and player created, the game feels mostly complete and whole finally. Like any MMO it will continue to evolve and not always in a direction everyone will be happy with. That said the Development team generally gets it right. The free to play aspect is among the best I have encountered in all my thirty years as a gamer and the last ten or so with my encounters with free to play models. There are items a player would need to purchase for endgame such as ship upgrade tokens, fleet modules, and a removal of the energy credit cap. All items mentioned can be purchased with either cashy money or in game dillithium converted to game currency through the dillithium exchange. Now for the bad. The PvP is woefully lacking in improvement and attention since launch. While it can be entertaining the public qeues are so one sided and have been since a few months after launch. Abilities are often unblanaced to a fault. Often you are stuck with either the cookie cutter flavor of the month builds, abilites, Duty officer combinations. Even if you have a great build you can expect to lose unless you have a mostly coordinated team all geared and built to provide the DPS and support needed to win. I would not recommend PvP to any new player without first consulting with a PvP group in game sadly. As for the bad part of the PvE side, The Special task Force missions and Advanced Qeues have become a DPS race. You need to participate in advanced Qeues to get items needed for reputation gear. Often if you need reputation gear you are not in a position to contribute much to the team. another. Another issues is the complete lack of need for the Enginner and Science professions in game. In space missions and PvP they are vastly less valuable than a Tactical captain because they cannot produce the same kind of DPS. Having had thirty eight Max level characters before Delta Rising and Six after fully geared and tested to a minimum of 15k DPS and some to as high as 35k (Good but far from great measured by the Infected Space Advanced Standard) and often coordinating for PvP and having written a few of the build guides over the years I feel qualified to say this. It is just the nature of the game for now and may change with balancing as time goes on. On a final note for the PvE is a lack of attention to some bugs, though not game breaking, they can be irritating.All that said if you are still here I completely recommend this game. The good vastly outweighs the bad and I will continue to play so long as this is true. See you out there.",Thu Mar 25 08:16:54 EET 2021,f4097a0a-e926-47e4-a447-8573acdf0fd8

First they send you on a stupid quest to exact some justice on some lame fool who did something bad (insert short mission story line here), and when you finally get the guy and retrieve the spoils of battle from his cold dead corpse you have to run for days back to the quest giver to turn the mission in. So, for over an hour of gameplay you actually only played the game for maybe 5 minutes.  Not the case with Star Trek Online.In this space faring MMO you are the captain of your ship. You get to go out and have adventures and all that of a regular MMO with the flare of Star Trek. Along the way you can meet some characters from the shows. All that is to be expected. What was surprising was they way can get your quests. Like most MMOs you can walk up to a quest-giver and talk to them and they will give you the quest. In Star Trek Online you have the option of Calling them from your ship and selecting the mission from the list of available missions. It's almost as if the creators knew that you'd be a long, long way out in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't want to continually run back to to them just to turn in a quest. It is Star Trek, after all, why not just put them up on the main screen, Number One, and we can get on with our mission?Overall the graphics are basic for what systems can pull these days, and the voice acting in ok. The gameplay is a MMO game so you quest a lot. If you are a fan of Star Trek like me then you can forgive the game a lot and play for fun. At the sweet price of free, you don't even really need to be a fan to try it and see if space adventuring is right for you. Just keep in mind, if you are looking for the next blockbuster MMO to scale the mountain and dares all to knock them off of it, you're looking in the wrong place.

The writers keep coming out with new content and events to keep you interested long after the standard missions have dried up.Character customisation allows you to redesign your character again and again and with new costume options available to everyone fairly soon after you dive in you can keep tweaking that look to match your characters' personality.The best experience however is to play in a team as this will bring greater rewards and teach you a thing or two. If teamwork is your thing then join up with an established fleet or take the plunge yourself and create a fleet just for your friends. Fleet management is, I will warn you, a time consuming and stressful at times vocation but it can and does bring its' own rewards.So many dimenions to the economies of the various currencies out there to mention here but a shrewd investor can actually make Zen (PWE's in-game currency) from the dilithium market.Overall, I'd recommend this to my friends as you have the option of playing for free and if you like it, you can always spend a bit of pocket money on improvements or even a new ship.7.5/10",Sun Mar 28 17:55:23 EEST 2021,966b1047-95b1-4dcb-ac15-4720d181d1aa

If you want to roleplay in Star Trek fashion, the character creation system and customization is amazing. There are many uncharted planets and abilities to customize your own missions (Foundry) to make your own stuff to play in and publish it for others to enjoy too. If you're a Star Trek fan looking for a game to live the world of Star Trek, this is the best game you're gonna get for your fan fiction roleplaying adoration. I log on many hours because I like being a Federation dude acting all big police guy patrolling systems and enacting different classes of Star Fleet ships for different roles. The creativity is endless, the game functionality is limited which is why it can feel repeatitive and boring.

I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one.

I was unfortunate enough to not play this during the heyday of point and click games back in the 90s, however I am very glad I gave this a try and can see why many hold it in regard as one of the best. Secret of Monkey Island has some of the wittiest writing, flat out funny characters and engaging setting that really propels it above other point and clicks. I greatly appreciate the ability to toggle between the old spritework of the original and the new graphics with the simple push of a button, however if I had to nitpick one thing I wish you could keep the voice acting while playing on the original graphics. Ah well. Secret of Monkey Island is a fantastic game, one of the very best if not the best point and click adventure game right up there with the best of the genre like Fate of Atlantis and Grim Fandango, and while the puzzles are not nearly as devious as the latter game (don't even get me started on Grim Fandango that game is downright evil with some of its puzzles) the puzzles here are challenging enough to leave you stumped but never stuck for hours on end like many games of the 90s were known to do.
