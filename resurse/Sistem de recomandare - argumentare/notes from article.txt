Approaches for building recommendation systems: collaborative filtering,
content based filtering, hybrid filtering

1.collaborative filtering: recommends items by identifying other users with similar taste;
it uses their opinion to recommend items to the active user.

2.content based filtering: match content resources to user characteristics. Content-based filtering techniques normally 
base their predictions on userâ€™s information, and they ignore contributions from other users as with the case
 of collaborative techniques.

3. Hybrid filtering, which combines two or more filtering techniques in different ways in order to increase
 the accuracy and performance of recommender systems has been proposed. These techniques combine
 two or more filtering approaches in order to harness their strengths while leveling out their corresponding
 weaknesses [21]. They can be classified based on their operations into weighted hybrid, mixed hybrid, switching
 hybrid, feature-combination hybrid, cascade hybrid, feature-augmented hybrid and meta-level hybrid

Content based filtering approaches: Vector Space Model such as Term Frequency/ Inverse Document Frequency
(TF/IDF), Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, Neural Networks. Statistical analysis or machine learning
techniques. The major disadvantage of CBF is the need to have an in-depth knowledge and description
 of the features of the items in the profile.

Collaborative filtering is a domain-independent prediction technique for content that cannot easily
 and adequately be described by metadata such as movies and music. Collaborative filtering technique works
 by building a database (user-item matrix) of preferences for items by users. It then matches users with
 relevant interest and preferences by calculating similarities between their profiles to make recommendations
