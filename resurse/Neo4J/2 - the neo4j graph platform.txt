ACID transactions - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Transaction in databases - an indivisible unit of work

Atomic - All changes to the data must be performed successfully or not at all
Consistent - Data must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction
Isolated - No other process can change the data while the transaction is running
Durable - The changes made by a transaction must persist
