(alternative answer)
MATCH (gene:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(other:Person)
MATCH (d:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
WHERE gene.name = 'Gene Hackman'
RETURN m.title AS movie, d.name AS director, other.name AS actor

Official answer:

MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person),
      (a2:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE a.name = 'Gene Hackman'
RETURN m.title as movie, d.name AS director , a2.name AS `co-actors`
