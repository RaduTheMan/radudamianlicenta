Add the roles property to the three ACTED_IN relationships that you just created to the movie, Forrest Gump using this information: Tom Hanks
 played the role, Forrest Gump. Robin Wright played the role, Jenny Curran. Gary Sinise played the role, Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

Hint: You can set each relationship using separate MATCH clauses. You can also use a CASE clause to set the values. Look up in the documentation
 for how to use the CASE clause. (haha, I used the map data structure :p)




MATCH (p:Person)-[rel:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie {title: 'Forrest Gump'})
WITH {`Tom Hanks`:'Forrest Gump',
      `Robin Wright`:'Jenny Curran',
      `Gary Sinise`:'Lieutenant Dan Taylor'} AS rolesData, p, rel, m
WHERE p.name IN KEYS(rolesData)
SET rel.roles = [rolesData[p.name]]
RETURN p, rel, m
